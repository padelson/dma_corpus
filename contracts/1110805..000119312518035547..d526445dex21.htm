be deposited with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the NSH Unitholders,
for exchange in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ III_, through the
Exchange Agent, the New Common Units and cash as required by this _Article_ __
_ III_. The Partnership agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from
time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any unpaid distributions in
respect of NSH Units pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_, to pay any
distributions in respect of New Common Units in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 3.3(c)_ and to make payments in lieu of any fractional New Common Units
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_. Any cash and New Common Units deposited
with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for any fractional New Common
Units in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_ and any distributions in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid for NSH Units pursuant to this Agreement out of the

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Partnership shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder
of NSH Units (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that in respect
of Certificated Units, delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificated Units shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificated Units to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in customary form and
agreed to by the Partnership and NSH prior to the Effective Time) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificated Units
or Book-Entry Units in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Certificated Units or Book-Entry Units. Promptly after the
Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificated Units, if any, for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly
completed and duly executed, and such other documents (including in respect of
Book-Entry Units) as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the NSH
Unitholders shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) New Common
Units representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of New Common Units
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article_ __ _
III_ (after taking into account all NSH Units then held by such holder) and
(B) a check in the amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ III_,
including cash payable in lieu of any fractional New Common Units pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_ and distributions pursuant to

 



14   _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration or on any unpaid distributions
_ _ payable to NSH Unitholders. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
NSH Units that is not registered in the transfer records of NSH, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such NSH Units may be paid to a
transferee, if the Certificated Units or evidence of ownership of the Book-
Entry Units are presented to the Exchange Agent, and in the case of both
Certificated Units and Book-Entry Units, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange
shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name
other than that of the record holder of such NSH Units, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are
not payable. Until the required documentation has been delivered and
Certificated Units, if any, have been surrendered, as contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_, each Certificated Unit or Book-Entry Unit shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
NSH Units (including any cash in lieu of fractional units pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_) and any distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to_ _Unexchanged_ _NSH Units_. No
distributions declared or made with respect to Common Units with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any NSH Units with
respect to the New Common Units that such holder would be entitled to receive
in accordance herewith and no cash payment in lieu of fractional New Common
Units shall be paid to any such holder until such holder shall deliver the
required documentation and surrender any Certificated Units or Book-Entry
Units as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_. Subject to applicable
Law, following compliance with the requirements of _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_,
there shall be paid to such holder of the New Common Units issuable in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such
compliance, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional New Common
Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_ and
the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to the New Common Units and payable with respect
to such New Common Units, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such compliance payable with
respect to such New Common Units.

 

(d) _Further Rights in NSH Units_. The Merger Consideration issued upon
conversion of an NSH Unit in accordance with the terms hereof and any cash
paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_ or _Section_ __
_ 3.3(e)_ shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such NSH Unit.

(e) _Fractional Common Units_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no fractional New Common Units shall be issued in
the Merger. All fractional New Common Units that an NSH Unitholder would
otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated
and, if a fractional New Common Unit results from such aggregation, such NSH
Unitholder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash,
without interest, determined by multiplying the Common Unit Price by the
fraction of a New Common Unit that such NSH Unitholder would otherwise have
been entitled to receive. As promptly as practicable after the determination
of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of

 



15  fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify the Partnership,
and the Partnership shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, deposit
such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to
forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
constituting New Common Units or cash that remains undistributed to the NSH
Unitholders after 180 days following the Effective Time shall be delivered to
the Partnership upon demand and, from and after such delivery, any former NSH
Unitholders who have not theretofore complied with this  _Article_ __ _ III_
shall thereafter look only to the Partnership for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such NSH Units, any cash in lieu of fractional New
Common Units to which they are entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_,
any unpaid distribution in respect of NSH Units pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.2(a_), and any distributions with respect to the New Common Units to which
they are entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_, in each case, without
any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by NSH Unitholders
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Partnership, free and
clear of any Liens, claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 

(g) _No Liability_. Neither the Partnership, the General Partner, NuStar
GP, NSH nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any NSH Unitholder for
any Common Units (or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any certificate representing a Certificated
Unit shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Partnership, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Partnership may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
NSH Units represented by such certificate and any distributions to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_.

 

(i) _Withholding_. Each of the Partnership, NSH, the Surviving Entity and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person (including any NSH
Unitholder) such amounts as the Partnership, NSH, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable, is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the
making of such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership, NSH,
the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall provide
reasonable notice to the applicable Person (including the applicable NSH
Unitholders) prior to withholding any amounts pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.3(_ _i_ _)_. To the extent that amounts are so _ _ deducted and withheld by
the Partnership, NSH, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, such amounts
shall be (i) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the
Partnership, NSH, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, and (ii) timely paid over to the appropriate taxing authority.

 



16 (j) _Book Entry and Admission of Holders of New Common Units
as Additional Limited Partners of the Partnership_ _._ Upon the issuance of
New Common Units to the NSH Unitholders in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
3.3_ and the compliance by such holders with the requirements of Section 10.4
of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, which requirements may be
satisfied by each holder of New Common Units by the execution and delivery by
such holder of a completed and executed letter of transmittal, each
NSH Unitholder shall be deemed to have made a capital contribution to the
Partnership, the General Partner shall be deemed to have automatically
consented to the admission of such holders as limited partners of the
Partnership and NuStar GP, on behalf of the General Partner, shall reflect or
cause to be reflected such admission on the books and records of the
Partnership.

 

Section 3.4 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event of any subdivisions,
reclassifications, recapitalizations, splits, combinations or distributions
in the form of equity interests with respect to NSH Units or Common Units (in
each case, as permitted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.3_), the number of New
Common Units to be issued in the Merger and the Common Unit Price determined
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(e)_ will be correspondingly adjusted.

 

Section 3.5 _NSH LTIP Restricted Common Units_ _._

 

(a) (i) At the Effective Time, each award of phantom NSH Units granted
under the NSH LTIP (" _NSH Restricted Unit_ ") outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without action of the part of
the holders thereof, be converted, on the same terms and conditions (except as
provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.5(a)(_ _i_ _)_ ) as were applicable to
such awards immediately prior to the Effective Time, into an award to receive
Restricted Common Units (and distribution equivalent rights, if any, with
respect to Common Units). The number of Restricted Common Units subject to
each such converted award shall be determined by multiplying the number of NSH
Restricted Units subject to the award immediately prior to the Effective Time
by 0.55, except that if the aggregate number of Restricted Common Units
subject to the award after such conversion would result in a fractional
Restricted Common Unit, then the aggregate number of Restricted Common Units
subject to the award shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and
upon vesting and settlement of the award, the holder shall be entitled to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, determined by multiplying the
Fair Market Value (as defined in the NSH LTIP, except where such definition
refers to a "Unit" or "Units," such term shall mean "Common Unit" or "Common
Units," as defined herein) by the fraction of the Restricted Common Unit that
would have been subject to the award.

 

(ii) Prior to, or as of, the Effective Time, the NSH Board shall take all
necessary actions, if any, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of
the NSH LTIP and the award agreements evidencing the NSH Restricted Units, to
provide for the automatic conversion on the Effective Time of the NSH
Restricted Units into Restricted Common Units in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Partnership shall assume all of the
obligations of NSH under the NSH LTIP, each outstanding NSH Restricted Unit
and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof. On, or as soon as reasonably
practicable after, the Effective Time, the Partnership 

 



17  shall deliver to each holder of an outstanding award granted under the NSH
LTIP a new award agreement setting forth the terms of such individuals award
of Restricted Common Units as a result of the automatic conversion of the
participants NSH Restricted Units as provided herein, which award agreement
shall continue in effect the same terms applicable to the NSH Restricted Units
under the NSH LTIP (subject to the adjustments set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.5(a)_).

Section 3.6 _Tax Treatment_. The Partnership, the General Partner, NuStar
GP and NSH intend to treat the Merger as an "assets-over" partnership merger
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i) pursuant
to which the Partnership is the "resulting partnership" in the Merger (within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.708-1(c)), and, as a result, (a)
the receipt of cash in lieu of the receipt of fractional New Common Units in
exchange for NSH Units in connection with the Merger shall be treated as a
sale of such NSH Units by the NSH Unitholder and a purchase of such NSH Units
by the Partnership for the cash so paid under the terms of this Agreement in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4), and (b) upon the
receipt of the NSH Unitholder Approval, each such NSH Unitholder who accepts
cash shall agree and consent to the treatment described in clause (a) as a
condition to receiving such consideration, in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4).

all related documents) to be filed by the Partnership with the SEC in
connection with the issuance of New Common Units in the Merger as contemplated
by this Agreement. Provided NSH has cooperated as required above,
the Partnership agrees to file the Registration Statement with the SEC as
promptly as practicable. Each of NSH and the Partnership agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after filing
thereof. The Partnership also agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any and all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Partnership agrees to furnish to NSH all information concerning
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, officers, directors, unitholders and any
applicable Affiliates, other than NSH and its Subsidiaries, and NSH hereby
agrees to furnish to the Partnership all information concerning NSH and its
Subsidiaries and their officers, directors, unitholders and Affiliates, and
each of the Partnership and NSH agrees to take such other action as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing.

(b) Each of NSH and the Partnership agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that (i) none of the information supplied or to be supplied by
it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement
will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement
thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated

 



28  therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
distribution to the NSH Unitholders and at the time of the NSH Meeting, not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of NSH and the Partnership further agrees that if it shall
become aware prior to the Closing Date of any information that would cause any
of the statements in the Registration Statement to be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not false or misleading, it will promptly inform the
other thereof and take the necessary steps to correct such information in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement.

 

(c) The Partnership will advise NSH, promptly after the Partnership
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the
issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of the New
Common Units for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or
threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC
for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for
additional information.

 

(d) NSH will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be distributed to its unitholders as soon as practicable after
the effective date of the Registration Statement.

Section 6.4 _Press Releases_. Prior to an NSH Change in Recommendation,
if any, except for any investor presentation or material prepared by
management in the ordinary course of announcing and discussing this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby in a manner materially consistent
with the substance of the press release and other communications materials
issued in connection with the announcement of such transactions, each of NSH
and the Partnership will not, without the prior approval of the NSH Board in
the case of NSH and the NuStar GP Board in the case of the Partnership, issue
any press release or written statement for general circulation relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law or the rules of the NYSE, in which case it will consult with the other
before issuing any such press release or written statement.

 

Section 6.5 _Access; Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, afford the other Parties and their officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives, access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of
its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its
officers, employees, accountants, counsel or other representatives, and,
during such period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish
promptly to such Person and its representatives (i) a copy of each material
report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements
of federal or state securities law (other than reports or documents that NSH
or the Partnership or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, are
not permitted to disclose under applicable Law or that are otherwise

 



29  publicly available through their respective websites) and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other may
reasonably request. Neither NSH nor the Partnership nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under the circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) The Partnership and NSH, respectively, will not use any information
obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ (to
which it was not entitled under Law or any agreement other than this
Agreement) for any purpose unrelated to (i) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) the matters contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ in accordance with the terms thereof, and will hold
all information and documents obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_
or _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ in confidence (except as permitted by _Section_ __ _
6.6(b)_). No investigation by either such Party of the business and affairs of
the other shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to either
such Partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 6.6 _Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) NSH agrees that from and after the date of this Agreement, it shall (i)
immediately cease and terminate, and cause to be ceased and terminated, all
of its, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives existing
activities, discussions and negotiations (including any electronic data room
access) with any other Person (other than the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective Representatives) regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or a proposal or offer relating to the acquisition of all
or a portion of the GP Interest or the Incentive Distribution Rights,
and (ii) promptly request that each Person that has entered into a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a possible
Acquisition Proposal or a proposal or offer relating to the acquisition of all
or a portion of the GP Interest or the Incentive Distribution Rights within
the last twelve months return to NSH or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished or made available to such Person by or on behalf of NSH
and its Subsidiaries or the Partnership. From and after the date of this
Agreement, none of NSH and its Subsidiaries shall, and NSH shall cause its
Subsidiaries and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
and their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) knowingly
initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers
with respect to, or the submission of, any Acquisition Proposal, the GP
Interest or the Incentive Distribution Rights or (ii) knowingly
engage, participate in, encourage or facilitate any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or knowingly furnish or make available or cause to be
furnished or made available to any person any non-public information or data
relating to NSH, the Partnership or its Subsidiaries in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal, the GP Interest or the Incentive Distribution Rights.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the limitations in  _Section_
__ _ 6.6(b)_, NSH may, prior to obtaining NSH Unitholder Approval, furnish
any information to, including information pertaining to the Partnership or its
Subsidiaries, and enter into or participate in discussions or negotiations
with, any Person that makes an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from an intentional and material breach

 



30  of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ (such Person making such a proposal, a "
_Receiving Party_ "), if (i) the NSH Board after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, determines in good faith (A)
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result
in a Superior Proposal, and (B) that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, as modified by
the NSH LLC Agreement and (ii) prior to furnishing any Non-Public Information
to such Receiving Party, NSH receives from such Receiving Party an executed
Confidentiality Agreement. NSH agrees that any breach of the restrictions or
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ by NSH or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the extent directed by NSH or any of its
Subsidiaries, any of its and their Representatives shall be a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ by NSH.

 

(b) Prior to obtaining NSH Unitholder Approval, NSH may provide any
Receiving Party with any non-public information or data pertaining to NSH, the
Partnership or any of their respective Subsidiaries (the " _Non-Public
Information_") only if NSH has not intentionally and materially breached this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ and then only if (i) the NSH Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors that the provision of such Non-Public Information to the Receiving
Party is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (ii) NSH shall
have first (A) required the Receiving Party to execute a
Confidentiality Agreement, (B) furnished a copy of such Confidentiality
Agreement to the Partnership and (C) notified the Partnership of the identity
of such Receiving Party. NSH shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours)
provide or make available to the Partnership any Non-Public Information
concerning NSH or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available
to any Receiving Party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ which was not
previously provided or made available to the Partnership. The Partnership
shall provide to NSH and any Receiving Party that has executed a
Confidentiality Agreement any Non-Public Information relating to the
Partnership that NSH reasonably requests in connection with exercising its
rights under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_, and
without prejudice to NSHs right to terminate this Agreement in order to
accept a Superior Proposal pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_, the NSH Board
shall not (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to the Partnership, the NSH
Recommendation, (B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (C) fail to include the NSH
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (D) if any Acquisition Proposal has
been made public, fail to issue a press release recommending against such
Acquisition Proposal and reaffirming the NSH Recommendation, if requested by
the Partnership in writing, within the earlier of (x) ten (10) Business Days
of such written request, and (y) two (2) Business Days before the NSH Meeting;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership may only make such request once
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is
materially modified in which case the Partnership may make such request once
each time such material modification is made or (E) resolve, publicly propose
or agree to do any of the foregoing (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as an " _NSH Change in Recommendation_ "); or (ii) except
for a Confidentiality Agreement, approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow NSH or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
or other similar contract or any tender or exchange

 



31  offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection with, any Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
NSH Unitholder Approval, the NSH Board may terminate this Agreement in order
to accept a Superior Proposal pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ or make an
NSH Change in Recommendation (x) following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from an intentional and material breach of this Section
6.6 and that the NSH Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (y) solely in response to an Intervening Event, and in each case
referred to in clauses (x) and (y) above, the NSH Board has concluded in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that the failure to make an NSH Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, as modified by
the NSH LLC Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the NSH Board shall not
be entitled to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement in order to
accept a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 8.1(d) or make an NSH
Change in Recommendation unless NSH has (i) provided to the Partnership and
the NuStar GP Board and the NuStar GP Conflicts Committee three (3) Business
Days prior written notice (such notice, a " _Notice of Proposed Recommendation
Change_ ") advising the Partnership that the NSH Board intends to take such
action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail, including,
if applicable, the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the
basis of the proposed action and the identity of the Person making the
proposal and contemporaneously providing a copy of all relevant
proposed transaction documents for such Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the terms of any such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Proposed Recommendation Change and an
additional three (3) Business Day period), (ii) during such period, NSH and
its Representatives shall, if requested by the Partnership, be available to
meet and engage in good faith negotiations with the Partnership and its
Representatives to modify this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the
need to make an NSH Change in Recommendation in response to such Intervening
Event, (iii) at the end of such period, if the Partnership has agreed to
modify the terms of this Agreement, the NSH Board (after taking into
account any agreed modification to the terms of this Agreement) has
determined that, if applicable, such Superior Proposal continues to be a
Superior Proposal or such Intervening Event continues to be an Intervening
Event, and in each case that the failure to terminate this Agreement to
accept a Superior Proposal or make an NSH Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, as modified by
the NSH LLC Agreement, and (iv) if applicable, provided to the Partnership
all materials and information delivered or made available to or by the Person
making any Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal (to the
extent not previously provided). Any NSH Change in Recommendation shall
not change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the NSH
Board, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing any
Takeover Law to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including the Merger. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Partnership shall maintain, and cause their
Representatives to maintain, the confidentiality of all information received
from NSH pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

(d) In addition to the obligations of NSH set forth in this  _Section_ __
_ 6.6_, NSH shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 48
hours after receipt) advise the Partnership orally and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any
such Acquisition Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of
the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal. NSH shall keep the
Partnership informed on a reasonably current basis of material developments to
the status and details (including any material amendments to the terms
thereof) with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal.

 



32 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the NSH Board
from taking and disclosing to the NSH Unitholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to NSH Unitholders) or from making any legally required
disclosure to NSH Unitholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, if, the NSH Board after consultation with outside counsel, has
concluded in good faith that the failure to disclose such information would
reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under applicable Law. Any
"stop-look-and-listen" communication by the NSH Board to the NSH Unitholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the NSH Unitholders) which does not effect an NSH Change in
Recommendation shall not in and of itself be considered a failure to make, or
a withdrawal, modification or change in any manner adverse to the Partnership
of, all or a portion of, the NSH Recommendation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing set forth in this Section 6.6(e) shall be deemed to (x)
modify or supplement the definition of "NSH Change in Recommendation" or (y)
permit NSH or the NSH Board to make an NSH Change in Recommendation except as
otherwise permitted pursuant to Section 6.6(c).

Section 6.7 _Takeover Laws_. Neither Party shall take any action that
would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them shall take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if
necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any rights plan adopted
by such Party or any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect,
including, without limitation, Takeover Laws of any state that purport to
apply to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.8 _No Rights Triggered_. Each of NSH and the Partnership shall
take all steps necessary to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any other
action or combination of actions, or any other transactions contemplated
hereby, do not and will not result in the grant of any Rights to any Person
(a) in the case of NSH under the NSH LLC Agreement, and in the case of the
Partnership under the Partnership Agreement or (b) under any material
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a Party.

 

Section 6.9 _New Common Units Listed_. In the case of the Partnership, the
Partnership shall use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the
Closing, on the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance, the New Common Units.

 

Section 6.10 _Third-Party Approvals_.

 

(a) The Partnership and NSH and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all
documentation, to effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with the terms
and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and to
cause the Merger to be

 



33  consummated and the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement and the
Amended and Restated NuStar GP LLC Agreement to be effective as expeditiously
as practicable. Each of the Partnership and NSH shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the
other, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, with respect to, all material written information submitted to
any third party or any Regulatory Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the Parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and promptly. Each
Party agrees that it will consult with the other Parties with respect to the
obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties and Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party
will keep the other Parties apprised of the status of material matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Each Party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other Parties with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
unitholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
in connection with the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or any
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other Party or any
of such Subsidiaries to any Regulatory Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.11 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __
_Insurance_. 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the NSH LLC Agreement, or this Agreement
or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of
NSHs Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, the Partnership and
the Surviving Entity, jointly and severally, shall: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is at the date hereof or during the period from the
date hereof through the date of the Effective Time serving as a director
or officer of NSH or any of its Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with
respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in
effect, in connection with any Claim and any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof)
resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10)
days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified
Parties, any Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a
witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Claim
in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on
behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification
Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any
rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case
without the requirement of any bond or other security. The indemnification
and advancement obligations of the Partnership and the Surviving Entity
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto
(including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration and
approval thereof and the

 



34  process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of NSH or
any of its Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with respect to any
employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) after the
date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors
and personal and legal representatives. As used in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_:
(x) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed
action, whether instituted by any Party, any Governmental Authority or any
other Person, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to
the institution of any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism (" _Action_ "), arising out of or
pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or
service as a director or officer of NSH, any of its Subsidiaries, or as a
fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by any of the foregoing at or
prior to the Effective Time; and (y) the term " _Indemnification Expenses_ "
means reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and
obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as
telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness
in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, including any Action relating to a
claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party.
Neither the Partnership nor the Surviving Entity shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Action in
respect of which indemnification has been or could be sought by
such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Action without admission or finding of
wrongdoing, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Partnership and NSH agree that
all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the NSH LLC Agreement
(and, as applicable, partnership agreement, limited liability company
agreement, or other organizational documents of any of NSHs Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements of NSH or any of its Subsidiaries shall be assumed
by the Surviving Entity, the Partnership and NuStar GP in the Merger, without
further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the limited
liability company agreement of NSH shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitations on
liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the NSH LLC
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or
prior to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification shall be required by Law and then only to the minimum extent
required by Law.

 



35 (d) The Partnership shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity
to, maintain for a period of at least six (6) years following the Effective
Time, the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by NSH and its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , __ that the
Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less
advantageous to such directors and officers of NSH than the terms and
conditions of such existing policy from carriers with the same or better
rating as the carrier under the existing policy _provided_ that such
substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to
matters occurring before the Effective Time) with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including
in respect of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , __ that the Partnership shall not be required to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by NSH prior to the
date hereof but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount.

 

(e) The provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.11(d)_ shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained by the Surviving
Entity for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ from carriers with the same
or better rating as the carrier of such insurances as of the date of this
Agreement, which policies provide such directors and officers with the
coverage described in _Section_ __ _ 6.11(d)_ for an aggregate period of not
less than six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in respect of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) If the Partnership, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership
or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Partnership and the Surviving Entity assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_.

 

(g) The Partnership and NuStar GP shall cause the Surviving Entity to
perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Entity under this _Section_
__ _ 6.11_.

(h) This _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and
personal representatives, and shall be binding on the Partnership, NuStar GP,
the Surviving Entity and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of NSH and the
Partnership shall give prompt notice to the other of (a) any fact, event or
circumstance known to such Party that (i) is reasonably likely, individually
or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to such
Party, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to such Party or
(ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or a
change in such Partys condition (financial or otherwise) or business or any
litigation or governmental complaints, investigations or hearings such that
one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_, _7.2(b)_ ,
_7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ , as applicable, would not reasonably be expected to be
satisfied.

 



36 Section 6.13 _Rule_ __ _ 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, each Party
shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any other Party hereto
to cause dispositions of NSH equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to NSH to be exempt under Rule 16b-3

earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, neither
NSH nor NuStar GP shall, without the consent of the NuStar GP Conflicts
Committee, eliminate the NuStar GP Conflicts Committee, or revoke or diminish
the authority of the NuStar GP Conflicts Committee, or, except in the event
of a material breach of his obligations as a director of NuStar GP, remove or
cause the removal of any director of the NuStar GP Board that is a member of
the NuStar GP Conflicts Committee either as a member of the NuStar GP Board
or the NuStar GP Conflicts Committee, or appoint any additional director to
the NuStar GP Board, in each case without the affirmative vote of the NuStar
GP Board, including the affirmative vote of a majority of members of the
NuStar GP Conflicts Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __
_ 6.16_ shall not apply to the filling of any vacancies caused by the death,
incapacity, removal or resignation of any director in accordance with the
provisions of the Amended and Restated NuStar GP LLC Agreement.

Section 6.17 _NuStar_ _GP Board Membership_. The Amended and Restated

Approval of this Agreement (except as expressly provided below):

 

(a) By the mutual consent of the Partnership and NSH in a written
instrument.

 

(b) By either the Partnership or NSH upon written notice to the other, if:

 

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before August 8, 2018 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ shall not be available to
a Party whose failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement
or other material breach of this Agreement has been the primary cause of the
failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before such date;

 

(ii) any Regulatory Authority has issued a statute, rule, order, decree or
regulation or taken any other action, in each case permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or any of
the Merger Transactions or making the Merger or any of the Merger Transactions
illegal and such statute, rule, order, decree, regulation or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable ( _provided_ that the terminating
Party is not then in breach of Section 6.1 in seeking to prevent, oppose or
remove such restraint, injunction or prohibition);

 

(iii) the NSH Meeting shall have been duly convened and held and NSH has
failed to obtain the NSH Unitholder Approval by reason of the failure to
obtain the required vote upon a final vote taken at the NSH Meeting (or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof at which such vote was taken); _provided_
, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_
__ _ 8.1(b)(iii)_ shall not be available to NSH where the failure to obtain
the NSH Unitholder Approval shall have been caused by the action or failure to
act of NSH and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach by
NSH of this Agreement;

(iv) there has been a breach of or any inaccuracy in any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of NSH

terminating Party, or which breach, by its nature,

 



41  cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date ( _provided_ in any such case
that the terminating Party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(iv)_ unless the breach of a
representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would
entitle the Party receiving such representation not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or

(v) there has been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth

Party of written notice of such breach from the terminating Party, or which
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date (
_provided_ in any such case that the terminating Party is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(v)_ unless
the breach of covenants or agreements, together with all other such breaches,
would entitle the Party receiving the benefit of such covenants or agreements
not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, as applicable.

(c) By the Partnership prior to the NSH Unitholder Approval having been

notice to NSH within ten (10) days of its receipt of notice from NSH that an
NSH Change in Recommendation has occurred.

(d) By NSH prior to obtaining the NSH Unitholder Approval, upon written
notice to the Partnership, in order to accept a Superior Proposal in
accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 6.6, if
(i) NSH has not intentionally and materially breached  _Section_ __ _ 6.6,_
(ii) NSH has paid the NSH Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_

43 (f) (i) If the Merger is consummated, the Partnership shall pay, or
cause to be paid, any and all property or transfer taxes imposed on any Party
in connection with the Merger, (ii) expenses incurred in connection with
filing, printing and distribution of the Proxy Statement and the Registration

the Code, treating the NSH Termination fee as non-qualifying income and after
taking into consideration all other sources of non-qualifying income (such
maximum amount, the " _Non-Qualifying Income Cushion_"), for such year, as
determined by independent accountants to the Partnership. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event the Partnership receives a reasoned opinion from
outside counsel or a ruling from the IRS (" _Tax Guidance_ ") providing that
the Partnerships receipt of the NSH Base Amount would either constitute
qualifying income (as defined in Section 7704(d) of the Code) or be excluded
from gross income for purposes of Section 7704 of the Code, the NSH
Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the NSH Base Amount and NSH shall,
upon receiving notice that the Partnership has received the Tax Guidance, pay
to the Partnership any unpaid portion of the NSH Base Amount within five (5)
Business Days. In the event that the Partnership is not able to receive the
full NSH Base Amount due to the above limitations, NSH shall place the unpaid
portion in escrow by wire transfer within three (3) days of termination and
shall not release any portion thereof to the Partnership unless and until the
Partnership receives either: (x) a letter from the Partnerships
independent accountants indicating the Non-Qualifying Income Cushion for any
subsequent year (in which case NSH shall pay to the Partnership the lesser of
the unpaid portion of the NSH Base Amount or the Non-Qualifying Income
Cushion specified within five (5) Business Days after NSH has been notified
thereof) or (y) Tax Guidance providing that the Partnerships receipt of
such portion would either constitute qualifying income (as defined in Section
7704(d) of the Code) or be excluded from gross income for purposes of Section
7704 of the Code (in which case NSH shall pay to the Partnership any unpaid
portion of the NSH Base Amount within five (5) Business Days after NSH been
notified thereof). The obligation of NSH to pay any unpaid portion of the NSH
Base Amount shall terminate on December 31 following the date that is five (5)
years from the date of this Agreement. Any amounts remaining in escrow after
the obligation of NSH to pay the NSH Base Amount terminates shall be retained
by NSH.

 

(h) Each of NSH, the General Partner, NuStar GP and Riverwalk Holdings
agrees that, notwithstanding any right that it, NuStar GP or the General
Partner may otherwise have, including pursuant to the Partnership Agreement,
the Amended and Restated Partnership

 



44  Agreement, or otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by law, it hereby
waives and renounces for itself, and shall execute any necessary waiver or
renunciation with respect to any distribution by the Partnership to which it
is or may become entitled in its capacity as partner of the Partnership of any
NSH Termination Fee paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section_
__ _ 9.1(c)_ or any Expense reimbursement paid to the Partnership by NSH (or

to the Partnership Unitholders (excluding NSH, Riverwalk Holdings, NuStar GP

in writing by the Party benefited by the provision and approved by the NuStar
GP Conflicts Committee in the case of the Partnership and by the NSH Conflicts
Committee in the case of NSH and executed in the same manner as this
Agreement, or (b) amended or modified at any time, whether before or after the
NSH Unitholder Approval, by an agreement in writing among the Parties hereto
approved by the NuStar GP Conflicts Committee in the case of the Partnership
and by the NSH Conflicts Committee in the case of NSH and executed in the same
manner as this Agreement, _provided_ , that after the NSH Unitholder Approval,
no amendment shall be made that requires further NSH Unitholder Approval
without such approval.

Section 9.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original.

Section 9.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without

respective agents, attorneys and accountants will maintain the
confidentiality of all information provided in connection herewith to the
extent required by, and subject to the limitations of, _Section_ __ _

matter that is the subject of any such proceedings is vested exclusively in
the federal courts of the United States of America, the United States District

appropriate, in the discretion of the General Partner or the Liquidator, to
effectuate the terms or intent of this Agreement; _provided_ , that when
required by _Section_ __ _ 13.3_ or any other provision of this Agreement
that establishes a percentage of the Limited Partners or of the Limited
Partners of any class or series required to take any action, the General
Partner and the Liquidator may exercise the power of attorney made in this

that the General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to cause record title to

Partnership as soon as reasonably practicable; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
prior to the withdrawal or removal of the General Partner or as soon
thereafter as practicable, the General Partner shall use reasonable efforts
to effect the transfer of record title to the Partnership and, prior to any

32 (b) The appropriate officers of NuStar GP on behalf of the General
Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute and deliver, and the
Transfer Agent shall countersign a new Certificate in place of any Certificate
previously issued if the Record Holder of the Certificate:

 

(i) makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the

Person, regardless of whether the Partnership shall have actual or other
notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by law or any applicable rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on
which such Partnership Interests are listed for trading. Without limiting the
foregoing, when a Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or
clearing corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing) is acting as
nominee, agent or in some other representative capacity for another Person in
acquiring and/or holding Partnership Interests, as between the Partnership on
the one hand, and such other Persons on the other, such representative Person

Partnership a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it
may prescribe and subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.5(b)_, the
Partnership will provide for the registration and transfer of Partnership
Securities. The Transfer Agent is hereby appointed registrar and transfer
agent for the purpose of registering Partnership Securities and transfers of
such Partnership Securities as herein provided. The Partnership shall not
recognize transfers of Certificates evidencing Limited Partner Interests
unless such transfers are effected in the manner described in this _Section_
__ _ 4.5_. Upon surrender of a Certificate for registration of transfer of

Interests as was evidenced by the Certificate so surrendered.

 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.8_, the Partnership
shall not recognize any transfer of Limited Partner Interests until the
Certificates evidencing such Limited Partner Interests are surrendered for
registration of transfer and such Certificates are accompanied by a Transfer
Application duly executed by the transferee (or the transferees attorney-in-
fact duly authorized in writing). No charge shall be imposed by the
Partnership for such transfer; _provided_ , that as a condition to the
issuance of any new Certificate under this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_, the
Partnership may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed with respect thereto.

 



34 (c) Limited Partner Interests may be transferred only in the
manner described in this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_. The transfer of any Limited
Partner Interests and the admission of any new Limited Partner shall not
constitute an amendment to this Agreement.

include custodians, nominees or any other individual or entity in its own or
any representative capacity.

delivered a Transfer Application shall be deemed to have (i) requested
admission as a Substituted Limited Partner, (ii) agreed to comply with and be
bound by and to have executed this Agreement, (iii) represented and warranted
that such transferee has the right, power and authority and, if an
individual, the capacity to enter into this Agreement, (iv) granted the powers
of attorney set forth in this Agreement and (v) given the consents and
approvals and made the waivers contained in this Agreement.

 

SECTION 4.6 _Transfer of the General Partner_ __ _s General Partner
Interest._

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.6(b)_ below, the General Partner may
transfer all or any of its General Partner Interest without Unitholder
approval.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no transfer by the
General Partner of all or any part of its General Partner Interest to another
Person shall be permitted unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the
rights and duties of the General Partner under this Agreement and to be
bound by the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) the Partnership receives an
Opinion of Counsel that such transfer would not result in the loss of limited
liability of any Limited Partner or of any limited partner of the Operating
Partnership or cause the Partnership or the Operating Partnership to be
treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as
an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so
treated or taxed) and (iii) such transferee also agrees to purchase all (or
the appropriate portion thereof, if applicable) of the partnership interest of
the General Partner as the general partner of each other Group Member. In the
case of a transfer pursuant to and in compliance with this _Section_ __ _
4.6_, the transferee or successor (as the case may be) shall, subject to
compliance with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, be admitted to the
Partnership as a General Partner immediately prior to the transfer of the
Partnership Interest, and the business of the Partnership shall continue
without dissolution.

 

SECTION 4.7 _Restrictions on Transfers._

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.7(c)_ below, but
notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Article IV_ , no transfer of
any Partnership Interests shall be made if such transfer would (i) violate the
then applicable federal or state securities laws or rules and regulations of
the Commission, any state securities commission or any other governmental
authority with jurisdiction over such transfer, (ii) terminate the existence
or qualification of the Partnership or the Operating Partnership under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, or (iii) cause the Partnership or
the Operating Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax
purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed).

 



35 (b) The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer
of Partnership Interests if a subsequent Opinion of Counsel determines that
such restrictions are necessary to avoid a significant risk of the Partnership
becoming taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for
federal income tax purposes. The restrictions may be imposed by making such
amendments to this Agreement as the General Partner may determine to be
necessary or appropriate to impose such restrictions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any amendment that the General Partner believes, in the exercise of its
reasonable discretion, could result in the delisting or suspension of trading
of any class of Limited Partner Interests on the principal National Securities
Exchange on which such class of Limited Partner Interests is then traded must
be approved, prior to such amendment being effected, by the holders of at
least a majority of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of such class.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this _Article IV_ , or elsewhere in this
Agreement, shall preclude the settlement of any transactions involving
Partnership Interests entered into through the facilities of any National
Securities Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed for
trading.

 

SECTION 4.8 _Citizenship Certificates; Non-citizen Assignees._

 

(a) If any Group Member is or becomes subject to any federal, state or
local law or regulation that, in the reasonable determination of the General
Partner, creates a substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any
property in which the Group Member has an interest based on the nationality,
citizenship or other related status of a Limited Partner or Assignee, the
General Partner may request any Limited Partner or Assignee to furnish to the
General Partner, within 30 days after receipt of such request, an executed
Citizenship Certification or such other information concerning his
nationality, citizenship or other related status (or, if the Limited Partner
or Assignee is a nominee holding for the account of another Person, the
nationality, citizenship or other related status of such Person) as the
General Partner may request. If a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to
furnish to the General Partner within the aforementioned 30-day period such
Citizenship Certification or other requested information or if upon receipt of
such Citizenship Certification or other requested information the
General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that a Limited
Partner or Assignee is not an Eligible Citizen, the Partnership Interests
owned by such Limited Partner or Assignee shall be subject to redemption in
accordance with the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 4.9_. In addition, the
General Partner may require that the status of any such Partner or Assignee be
changed to that of a Non-citizen Assignee and, thereupon, the General Partner
shall be substituted for such Non-citizen Assignee as the Limited Partner in
respect of his Limited Partner Interests.

 

(b) The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of
Limited Partner Interests held by it on behalf of Non-citizen Assignees,
distribute the votes in the same ratios as the votes of Partners (including
without limitation the General Partner) in respect of Limited Partner
Interests other than those of Non-citizen Assignees are cast, either for,
against or abstaining as to the matter.

 



36 (c) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, a Non-citizen Assignee shall have
no right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.4_
but shall be entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership
shall provide cash in exchange for an assignment of the Non-citizen
Assignees share of the distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment
shall be treated for Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership
from the Non-citizen Assignee of his Limited Partner Interest (representing
his right to receive his share of such distribution in kind).

 

(d) At any time after he can and does certify that he has become an
Eligible Citizen, a Non-citizen Assignee may, upon application to the General
Partner, request admission as a Substituted Limited Partner with respect to
any Limited Partner Interests of such Non-citizen Assignee not redeemed
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.9_, and upon his admission pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 10.2_, the General Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the Limited
Partner in respect of the Non-citizen Assignees Limited Partner Interests.

 

SECTION 4.9 _Redemption of Partnership Interests of Non-citizen
Assignees._

 

(a) If at any time a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to furnish a
Citizenship Certification or other information requested within the 30-day
period specified in _Section_ __ _ 4.8(a)_, or if upon receipt of such
Citizenship Certification or other information the General Partner determines,
with the advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner or Assignee is not an
Eligible Citizen, the Partnership may, unless the Limited Partner or Assignee
establishes to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such Limited
Partner or Assignee is an Eligible Citizen or has transferred his
Partnership Interests to a Person who is an Eligible Citizen and who
furnishes a Citizenship Certification to the General Partner prior to the date
fixed for redemption as provided below, redeem the Partnership Interest of
such Limited Partner or Assignee as follows:

(i) The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date
fixed for redemption, give notice of redemption to the Limited Partner or
Assignee, at his last address designated on the records of the Partnership or
the Transfer Agent, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid. The
notice shall be deemed to have been given when so mailed. The notice shall
specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for redemption, the place of
payment, that payment of the redemption price will be made upon surrender of
the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests and that on and after the
date fixed for redemption no further allocations or distributions to which the
Limited Partner or Assignee would otherwise be entitled in respect of the
Redeemable Interests will accrue or be made.

 

(ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an
amount equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which
shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the
class to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests
of each such class included among the Redeemable Interests. The redemption
price shall be paid, in the discretion of the General Partner, in cash or by
delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of
the redemption price, bearing interest at the rate of 10% annually and
payable in three equal annual installments of principal together with accrued
interest, commencing one year after the redemption date.

 



37 (iii) Upon surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner or Assignee,
at the place specified in the notice of redemption, of the Certificate
evidencing the Redeemable Interests, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by
an assignment duly executed in blank, the Limited Partner or Assignee or
his duly authorized representative shall be entitled to receive the payment
therefor.

(iv) After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer
constitute issued and Outstanding Limited Partner Interests.

 

(b) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.9_ shall also be applicable to
Limited Partner Interests held by a Limited Partner or Assignee as nominee of
a Person determined to be other than an Eligible Citizen.

 

(c) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.9_ shall prevent the recipient of a
notice of redemption from transferring his Limited Partner Interest before
the redemption date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this
Agreement. Upon receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner
shall withdraw the notice of redemption,  _provided_ the transferee of such
Limited Partner Interest certifies to the satisfaction of the General Partner
in a Citizenship Certification delivered in connection with the Transfer
Application that he is an Eligible Citizen. If the transferee fails to make
such certification, such redemption shall be effected from the transferee on
the original redemption date.

 

ARTICLE V

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

SECTION 5.1 _Transformation of the General Partner Interest._

 

The 2% general partner interest in the Partnership that existed immediately
prior to the Effective Time is, immediately following the Effective Time,
hereby converted into a non-economic, management interest in the Partnership.
Following the Effective Time, the General Partner Interest shall only
represent a non-economic, management interest of the General Partner in the
Partnership. Riverwalk Logistics, L.P. hereby continues as general partner of
the Partnership and the Partnership is hereby continued without dissolution.

SECTION 5.2 _Cancellation of Incentive Distribution Rights._

 

The Incentive Distribution Rights that existed immediately prior to the
Effective Time are, immediately following the Effective Time,
hereby cancelled. Following the Effective Time, no Person, in its capacity as
a former holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, shall have any rights
with respect to the Partnership as a former holder of the Incentive
Distribution Rights, including the right to receive any distributions from
the Partnership.

SECTION 5.3 _Contributions by Limited Partners_.

 

Each Limited Partner has contributed to the Partnership the cash or other
property (if any) as set forth in the books and records of the Partnership.

 



38 SECTION 5.4 _Interest and Withdrawal._

 

No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital Contributions. No
Partner or Assignee shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its
Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if any, that distributions made
pursuant to this Agreement or upon dissolution of the Partnership may be
considered as such by law and then only to the extent provided for in this
Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, no
Partner or Assignee shall have priority over any other Partner or Assignee
either as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or
distributions. Any such return shall be a compromise to which all Partners
and Assignees agree within the meaning of Section 17-502(b) of the Delaware
Act.

 

SECTION 5.5 _Capital Accounts._

 

(a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Limited Partner (or a
beneficial owner of Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in
which the nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership
in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable
to the General Partner in its sole discretion) owning a Partnership Interest
a separate Capital Account with respect to such Partnership Interest in
accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).
The initial Capital Account attributable to a Preferred Unit shall be
the Stated Liquidation Preference for such Preferred Unit, irrespective of
the amount paid by such holder for such Preferred Unit. Capital Accounts shall
be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital Contributions made to the
Partnership with respect to such Partnership Interest (other than a Preferred
Unit) pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) all items of Partnership income and
gain (including, without limitation, income and gain exempt from tax) computed
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_ and allocated with respect to
such Partnership Interest pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, and decreased by
(x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and
deemed distributions of cash or property made with respect to such
Partnership Interest pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ that the Capital
Account of a holder of Series A Preferred Units shall not be reduced by the
amount of Series A Distributions it receives, the Capital Account of a holder
of Series B Preferred Units shall not be reduced by the amount of Series B
Distributions it receives and the Capital Account of a holder of Series C
Preferred Units shall not be reduced by the amount of Series C Distributions
it receives and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_ and allocated with respect to such
Partnership Interest pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain,
loss or deduction which is to be allocated pursuant to _Article VI_ and is to
be reflected in the Partners Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition
and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination,
recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes (including,
without limitation, any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization
used for that purpose), _provided_ , that:

 

(i) Solely for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, the Partnership shall
be treated as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the
General Partner based upon the provisions of the Operating Partnership
Agreement) of all property owned by the Operating Partnership or any other
Subsidiary that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes.

 



39 (ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote
the sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted
nor amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of
Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time
such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the
Partners pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

 

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of
the Code which may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items described
in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard to the
fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are neither
currently deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes. To the
extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset
pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in
determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss.

(iv) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of
any Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnerships Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

(v) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any
deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any
Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the
Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.5(d)_ to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to
depreciation, cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such
depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property
shall be determined (A) as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal
to the Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment
and (B) using a rate of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization derived
from the same method and useful life (or, if applicable, the remaining useful
life) as is applied for federal income tax purposes; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, if the asset has a zero adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes,
depreciation, cost recovery or amortization deductions shall be determined
using any reasonable method that the General Partner may adopt.

 

(vi) If the Partnerships adjusted basis in a depreciable or cost recovery
property is reduced for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section
48(q)(1) or 48(q)(3) of the Code, the amount of such reduction shall, solely
for purposes hereof, be deemed to be an additional depreciation or cost
recovery deduction in the year such property is placed in service and shall
be allocated among the Partners pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_. Any
restoration of such basis pursuant to Section 48(q)(2) of the Code shall, to
the extent possible, be allocated in the same manner to the Partners to whom
such deemed deduction was allocated.

 



40 (c) A transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a Pro Rata
portion of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership
Interest so transferred.

 

(d) (i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests for
cash or Contributed Property, the issuance of Partnership Interests as
consideration for the provision of services or the conversion of the General
Partners Combined Interest to Common Units pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
11.3(b)_ or the issuance of a Noncompensatory Option (including the conversion
of a Series A Preferred Unit in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 16.11,_ the
conversion of a Series B Preferred Unit in accordance with _Section_ __ _
17.11_ and the conversion of a Series C Preferred Unit in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 18.11_), the Capital Accounts of all Partners and the Carrying
Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall
be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized
Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property
immediately prior to such issuance for an amount equal to its fair market
value and had been allocated to the Partners at such time pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_ in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually
recognized following an event giving rise to the dissolution of the
Partnership would have been allocated; _provided, however_ , that in the event
of the issuance of a Partnership Interest pursuant to the exercise of
a Noncompensatory Option where the right to share in Partnership capital
represented by such Partnership Interest differs from the consideration paid
to acquire and exercise such option, the Carrying Value of each Partnership
property immediately after the issuance of such Partnership Interest shall be
adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property and the Capital Accounts of the
Partners shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s); _provided further, however_ , that in the event
of an issuance of Partnership Interests for a de minimis amount of cash or
Contributed Property, in the event of an issuance of a Noncompensatory Option
to acquire a de minimis Partnership Interest, or in the event of an issuance
of a de minimis amount of Partnership Interests as consideration for the
provision of services, the General Partner may determine that
such adjustments are unnecessary for the proper administration of the
Partnership. If, upon the occurrence of a Revaluation Event described in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_, a Noncompensatory Option of the Partnership is
outstanding, the Partnership shall adjust the Carrying Value of each
Partnership property in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)(1) and 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2). In determining such
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market
value of all Partnership assets (including, without limitation, cash or
cash equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership
Interests (or, in the case of a Revaluation Event resulting from the exercise
of a Noncompensatory Option, immediately after the issuance of the Partnership
Interest acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Noncompensatory Option if
required pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(1))
shall be determined by the General Partner using such reasonable method of
valuation as it may adopt; _provided, however,_ that the General Partner, in
arriving at such valuation,

 



41  must take fully into account the fair market value of the Partnership
Interests of all Partners at such time. The General Partner shall allocate
such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership (in such manner as
it determines in its discretion to be reasonable) to arrive at a fair market
value for individual properties.

 

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any
Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of
all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be
adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property
immediately prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market
value, and had been allocated to the Partners, at such time, pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_ in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually
recognized following an event giving rise to the dissolution of the
Partnership would have been allocated. In determining such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all
Partnership assets (including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual
distribution which is not made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.4_ or in the
case of a deemed distribution, be determined and allocated in the same manner
as that provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)(i)_ or (B) in the case of a
liquidating distribution pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.4_, be determined
and allocated by the Liquidator using such reasonable method of valuation as
it may adopt.

SECTION 5.6 _Issuances of Additional Partnership Securities._

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ and subject to any approvals required
by Series A Holders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 16.4(b)_ and _Section_ __ _
16.4(c)_,any approvals required by Series B Holders pursuant to _Section
17.4(b)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 17.4(c)_ and any approvals required by Series C
Holders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 18.4(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 18.4(c)_, the
Partnership may issue additional Partnership Securities and options, rights,
warrants and appreciation rights relating to the Partnership Securities for
any Partnership purpose at any time and from time to time to such Persons for
such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall be established
by the General Partner in its sole discretion, all without the approval of any
Limited Partners.

 

(b) Each additional Partnership Security authorized to be issued by the
Partnership pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_ may be issued in one or more
classes, or one or more series of any such classes, with such designations,
preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing
classes and series of Partnership Securities), as shall be fixed by the
General Partner in the exercise of its sole discretion, including (i) the
right to share Partnership profits and losses or items thereof; (ii) the right
to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the rights upon dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership; (iv) whether, and the terms and conditions
upon which, the Partnership may redeem the Partnership Security; (v) whether
such Partnership Security is issued with the privilege of conversion or
exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange;
(vi) the terms and conditions upon which each Partnership Security will be
issued, evidenced by certificates and assigned or transferred; and (vii) the
right, if any, of each such Partnership Security to vote on Partnership
matters, including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and
privileges of such Partnership Security.

 



42 (c) The General Partner is hereby authorized and directed to take
all actions that it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with (i)
each issuance of Partnership Securities and options, rights, warrants and
appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_, (ii) the conversion of the General Partner Interest or
Preferred Units into Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (iii) the
admission of Additional Limited Partners and (iv) all additional issuances of
Partnership Securities. The General Partner is further authorized and directed
to specify the relative rights, powers and duties of the holders of the Units
or other Partnership Securities being so issued. The General Partner shall
do all things necessary to comply with the Delaware Act and is authorized and
directed to do all things it deems to be necessary or advisable in connection
with any future issuance of Partnership Securities or in connection with the
conversion of the General Partner Interest or Preferred Units into Units
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including compliance with any
statute, rule, regulation or guideline of any federal, state or other
governmental agency or any National Securities Exchange on which the Units or
other Partnership Securities are listed for trading.

SECTION 5.7 _No Fractional Units_. No fractional Units shall be issued by
the Partnership.

SECTION 5.8 _No Preemptive Right._

 

No Person shall have any preemptive, preferential or other similar right with
respect to the issuance of any Partnership Security, whether unissued, held
in the treasury or hereafter created.

SECTION 5.9 _Splits and Combinations._

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.9(d)_, the Partnership may make a Pro Rata
distribution of Partnership Securities (other than Preferred Units) to all
Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of Partnership
Securities so long as, after any such event, each Partner shall have the same
Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any amounts
calculated on a per unit basis (including those based on the Stated
Liquidation Preference) or stated as a number of Partnership Securities are
proportionately adjusted retroactive to the beginning of the Partnership. 

(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership
Securities is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of
which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and
shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each
Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such
notice. The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public
accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Securities
to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such
distribution, subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be
entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive
evidence of the accuracy of such calculation.

 



43 (c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or
combination, the Partnership may issue Certificates to the Record Holders of
Partnership Securities as of the applicable Record Date representing the new
number of Partnership Securities held by such Record Holders, or the General
Partner may adopt such other procedures as it may deem appropriate to reflect
such changes. If any such combination results in a smaller total number of
Partnership Securities Outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as a
condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such new Certificate, the
surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to
such Record Date.

 

(d) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Partnership Securities upon
any distribution, subdivision, combination, or conversion of any such
Partnership Security. If a distribution, subdivision, combination or
conversion of a Partnership Security would result in the issuance of
fractional Partnership Securities but for the provisions of this  _Section_
__ _ 5.9(d)_, each fractional Partnership Security shall be rounded to the
nearest whole Partnership Security (and a 0.5 Partnership Security shall be
rounded to the next higher Partnership Security).

 

SECTION 5.10 _Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner
Interests._ 

All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the
requirements of, this _Article V_ , _Article XVI_ ,  _Article XVII_ or
_Article XVIII_ shall be fully paid and non-assessable Limited Partner
Interests in the Partnership, except as such non-assessability may be affected
by Sections 17-303(a), 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act.

ARTICLE VI 

ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

 

SECTION 6.1 _Allocations for Capital Account Purposes._

 

For purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights
of the Partners among themselves, the Partnerships items of income, gain,
loss and deduction (computed in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_) shall
be allocated among the Partners in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as
provided herein below. For purposes of making allocations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_, a Person shall be considered as the holder solely of the
class of Partnership Interests to which such allocation relates.

 

(a) _Net Income_. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_, Net Income for each taxable period and all items
of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Income
for such taxable period shall be allocated to the Unitholders, in
accordance with their Percentage Interests.

(b) _Net Losses_. After giving effect to the special allocations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_, Net Losses for each taxable period and all
items of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net
Losses for such taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

 

(i) First, 100% to the Unitholders, in accordance with their Percentage
Interests; _provided_ , that Net Losses shall not be allocated pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(i)_ the extent that such allocation would cause
any Unitholder to have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account at
the end of such taxable year (or increase any existing deficit balance in its
Adjusted Capital Account);

 



44 (ii) Second, to all Preferred Holders, in proportion to their respective
positive Adjusted Capital Account balances, until the Adjusted Capital Account
in respect of each Preferred Unit then Outstanding has been reduced to zero.

 

(c) _Special Allocations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_, the following special allocations shall be made for
such taxable period:

(i) Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, if there is a net decrease in
Partnership Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner
shall be allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and,
if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and
1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision. For purposes of this  _Section_
__ _ 6.1(c)_, each Partners Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be
determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall be
effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_ with respect to such taxable period (other than an
allocation pursuant to _Sections 6.1(c)(vi)_ and _6.1(c)(vii)_ ). This
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)(i)_ is intended to comply with the Partnership Minimum
Gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and
shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

 

(ii) Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ (other than _Section_ __ _
6.1(c)(i)_), except as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4),
if there is a net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during
any Partnership taxable period, any Partner with a share of Partner
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be
allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if
necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor
provisions. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_, each Partners
Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of
income or gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application
of any other allocations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_ (other
than  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)(i)_ and other than an allocation pursuant to
_Sections_ __ _ 6.1(c)(vi)_ and _6.1(c)(vii)_ ), with respect to such taxable
period. This _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)(ii)_ is intended to comply with the
chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

 

(iii) Priority Allocations. If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value
of any property distributed (except cash or property distributed pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.4_) to any Unitholder with respect to its Units for a
taxable year is greater (on a per Unit basis) than the amount of cash or the
Net Agreed Value of property distributed to the other Unitholders with
respect to their Units (on a per Unit basis), then each Unitholder receiving
such greater cash or property distribution shall be allocated gross income in
an amount equal to the product of (A) the amount by which the distribution
(on a per Unit basis) to such Unitholder exceeds the distribution (on a per
Unit basis) to the Unitholders receiving the smallest distribution and (B) the
number of Units owned by the Unitholder receiving the greater distribution.

 



45 (iv) Qualified Income Offset. In the event any Partner unexpectedly
receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership income and gain shall be
specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted
Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as
quickly as possible unless such deficit balance is otherwise eliminated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)(i)_ or _(ii)_.

 

(v) Gross Income Allocations. In the event any Partner has a deficit
balance in its Capital Account at the end of any Partnership taxable period
in excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Partner is required to restore
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner
is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items
of Partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly
as possible; _provided_ , that an allocation pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
6.1(c)(v)_ shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would
have a deficit balance in its Capital Account as adjusted after all other
allocations provided for in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ have been tentatively
made as if this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)(v)_ was not in this Agreement.

 

(vi) Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period
shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests. If the General Partner determines in its good faith
discretion that the Partnerships Nonrecourse Deductions must be allocated in
a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner
is authorized, upon notice to the other Partners, to revise the prescribed
ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements.

(vii) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for
any taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the
Economic Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which
such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the
Economic Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such Partner
Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or
among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such
Economic Risk of Loss.

(viii) Nonrecourse Liabilities. For purposes of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain
and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated among
the Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

 



46 (ix) Code Section 754 Adjustments. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or
743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining
Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall
be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain
or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent
with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted
pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

 

(x) Economic Uniformity. For the proper administration of the Partnership
and for the preservation of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or
any class or classes thereof), the General Partner shall have sole discretion
to (A) adopt such conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the
amount of depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions; (B) make
special allocations of income (including, without limitation, gross income),
gain, loss, deduction, Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss or deductions; and
(C) amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the
proposal or promulgation of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or
Section 704(c) of the Code or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity
of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The
General Partner may adopt such conventions, make such allocations and make
such amendments to this Agreement as provided in this _Section_ __ _
6.1(c)(x)_ only if such conventions, allocations or amendments would not have
a material adverse effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes
of Limited Partner Interests issued and Outstanding or the Partnership, and if
such allocations are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the
Code.

(xi) Preferred Unit Allocations _._

 

(A) Income of the Partnership attributable to the issuance by the
Partnership of a Preferred Unit for an amount in excess of the Stated
Liquidation Preference for such Preferred Unit shall be allocated to the
Partners (other than Preferred Holders) in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests.

 

(B) Unrealized Gain, if any, for the taxable period (or, to the extent
necessary, items of income and gain for the taxable period) shall be
allocated to each Preferred Holder in proportion to, and to the extent of, an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the Stated Liquidation Preference
with respect to such holders Preferred Units, over (y) such holders
existing Capital Account balance in respect of its Preferred Units, until the
Capital Account balance of each such holder in respect of its Preferred Units
is equal to the Stated Liquidation Preference in respect of such Preferred
Units.

 



47 (xii) Curative Allocation.

 

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, other
than the Required Allocations, the Required Allocations shall be taken into
account in making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the
net amount of items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each
Partner pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations,
together, shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been
allocated to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required
Allocations and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Required
Allocations relating to (1) Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into
account except to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partnership
Minimum Gain and (2) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into
account except to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partner
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. Allocations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.1(c)(xii)(A)_ shall only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the
extent the General Partner reasonably determines that such allocations will
otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners.
Further, allocations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)(xii)(A)_ shall be
deferred with respect to allocations pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) hereof to
the extent the General Partner reasonably determines that such allocations
are likely to be offset by subsequent Required Allocations.

 

(B) The General Partner shall have reasonable discretion, with respect to
each taxable period, to (1) apply the provisions of _Section_ __ _
6.1(c)(xii)(A)_ in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic
distortions that might otherwise result from the Required Allocations, and (2)
divide all allocations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)(xii)(A)_ among the
Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic distortions.

 

SECTION 6.2 _Allocations for Tax Purposes._

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes,
each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the
Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of " _book_ " income,
gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

 

(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to
a Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss,
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
federal income tax purposes among the Partners as follows:

 

(i) (A) In the case of a Contributed Property, such items attributable
thereto shall be allocated among the Partners in the manner provided under
Section 704(c) of the Code that takes into account the variation between the
Agreed Value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of
contribution; and (B) any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable
to a Contributed Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same
manner as its correlative item of " _book_ " gain or loss is allocated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

 



48 (ii) (A) In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall (1) first,
be allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with the principles of
Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss attributable to such property and the allocations
thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)(i)_ or _5.5(d)(ii)_ , and (2)
second, in the event such property was originally a Contributed Property, be
allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with  _Section_ __ _
6.2(b)(i)(A)_; and (B) any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable
to an Adjusted Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same
manner as its correlative item of " _book_ " gain or loss is allocated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

(iii) The General Partner shall apply the principles of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities.

 

(c) The General Partner in its discretion may determine to depreciate or
amortize the portion of an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code
attributable to unrealized appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the
extent of the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate
derived from the depreciation or amortization method and useful life applied
to the Partnerships common basis of such property, despite any inconsistency
of such approach with Treasury Regulation Section 1.167(c)-l(a)(6), or any
successor regulations thereto. If the General Partner determines that such
reporting position cannot reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt
depreciation and amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring
Limited Partner Interests in the same month would receive depreciation and
amortization deductions, based upon the same applicable rate as if they had
purchased a direct interest in the Partnerships property. If the General
Partner chooses not to utilize such aggregate method, the General Partner may
use any other reasonable depreciation and amortization conventions to preserve
the uniformity of the intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner
Interests that would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited
Partners or the Record Holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner
Interests.

(d) Any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after
taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same
proportions and to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in
interest) have been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving
rise to the treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.

 

(e) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to
any election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made by the
Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that such allocations, once made, shall
be adjusted as necessary or appropriate to take into account those adjustments
permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.

 

(f) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction attributable
to a transferred Partnership Interest, shall for federal income tax purposes,
be determined on an annual basis and prorated on a monthly basis and shall be
allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the NYSE on the first Business
Day of each month; _provided_ , _however_ , that gain or

 



49  loss on a sale or other disposition of any assets of the Partnership other
than in the ordinary course of business shall be allocated to the Partners as
of the opening of the NYSE on the first Business Day of the month in which
such gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. The General
Partner may revise, alter or otherwise modify such methods of allocation as it
determines necessary, to the extent permitted or required by Section 706 of
the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.

(g) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under
the provisions of this _Article VI_ shall instead be made to the beneficial
owner of Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the
nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in
accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to
the General Partner in its sole discretion.

 

(h) If, as a result of an exercise of a Noncompensatory Option, a Capital
Account reallocation is required under Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the General Partner shall make corrective allocations
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

SECTION 6.3 _Requirement and Characterization of Distributions;
Distributions to Record Holders._

(a) Within 45 days following the end of each Quarter, an amount equal to
100% of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter shall, subject to Section
17-607 of the Delaware Act, be distributed in accordance with this _Article
VI_ by the Partnership to the Partners as of the Record Date selected by
the General Partner in its reasonable discretion. All amounts of Available
Cash distributed by the Partnership on any date from any source shall be
deemed to be Operating Surplus until the sum of all amounts of Available Cash
theretofore distributed by the Partnership to the Partners equals the amount
of Operating Surplus as calculated with respect to the Quarter in respect of
which such distribution of Available Cash is to be made through the close of
the Quarter. Any remaining amounts of Available Cash distributed by the
Partnership on such date shall be deemed to be " _Capital Surplus_."
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Partnership shall not make any distributions to any Partner on account of its
interest in the Partnership if such distribution would violate the Delaware
Act. This _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ (except for the second to the last sentence
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_) shall not apply to Preferred Units.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, in the event of the
dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership, all receipts received during
or after the Quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs, other than from
borrowings described in (a)(ii) of the definition of Available Cash, shall be
applied and distributed solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms
and conditions of, _Section_ __ _ 12.4_.

 

(c) The General Partner shall have the discretion to treat taxes paid by
the Partnership on behalf of, or amounts withheld with respect to, all or
less than all of the Partners, as a distribution of Available Cash to such
Partners.

 



50 (d) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be
paid by the Partnership, directly or through the Transfer Agent or through
any other Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership
Interest as of the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall
constitute full payment and satisfaction of the Partnerships liability in
respect of such payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an
interest in such payment by reason of an assignment or otherwise.

 

SECTION 6.4 _Distributions._

 

Available Cash with respect to any Quarter, shall be distributed in accordance
with each Limited Partners Percentage Interest (subject to  _Section_ __ _
16.3_ in respect of Series A Preferred Units described therein, _Section_ __ _
17.3_ in respect of Series B Preferred Units described therein and _Section_
__ _ 18.3_ in respect of Series C Preferred Units described therein and
except as otherwise required by _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ in respect of
additional Partnership Securities issued pursuant thereto).

 

SECTION 6.5 _Adjustment of Minimum Quarterly Distribution._

 

(a) The Minimum Quarterly Distribution shall be proportionately adjusted in
the event of any distribution, combination or subdivision (whether effected
by a distribution payable in Units or otherwise) of Units or other Partnership
Securities in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.9_. In the event of a
distribution of Available Cash that is deemed to be from Capital Surplus, the
then applicable Minimum Quarterly Distribution shall be adjusted
proportionately downward to equal the product obtained by multiplying the
otherwise applicable Minimum Quarterly Distribution by a fraction of which
the numerator is the Unrecovered Capital of the Common Units immediately
after giving effect to such distribution and of which the denominator is the
Unrecovered Capital of the Common Units immediately prior to giving effect to
such distribution.

 

(b) The Minimum Quarterly Distribution shall also be subject to adjustment
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

SECTION 6.6 _Entity-Level Taxation._

 

If legislation is enacted or the interpretation of existing language is
modified by the relevant governmental authority which causes the Partnership
or the Operating Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise subjects the Partnership or the Operating Partnership
to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the
then applicable Minimum Quarterly Distribution shall be adjusted to equal the
product obtained by multiplying (a) the amount thereof by (b) one minus the
sum of (i) the highest marginal federal corporate (or other entity, as
applicable) income tax rate of the Partnership or the Operating Partnership
for the taxable year of the Partnership or the Operating Partnership in which
such Quarter occurs (expressed as a percentage) plus (ii) the effective
overall state and local income tax rate (expressed as a percentage)
applicable to the Partnership or the Operating Partnership for the calendar
year next preceding the calendar year in which such Quarter occurs (after
taking into account the benefit of any deduction allowable for federal income
tax purposes with respect to the payment of state and local income taxes), but
only to the extent of the increase in such rates resulting from such
legislation or interpretation. Such effective overall 

 



51  state and local income tax rate shall be determined for the taxable year
next preceding the first taxable year during which the Partnership or the
Operating Partnership is taxable for federal income tax purposes as an
association taxable as a corporation or is otherwise subject to entity-level
taxation by determining such rate as if the Partnership or the Operating
Partnership had been subject to such state and local taxes during
such preceding taxable year.

to engage in and possess an interest in other business ventures of any and
every type or description, whether in businesses engaged in or anticipated to
be engaged in by any Group Member, independently or with others, including
business interests and activities in direct competition with the business and
activities of any Group Member, and none of the same shall constitute a
breach of this Agreement or any duty express or implied by law to any Group
Member or any Partner or Assignee. Neither any Group Member, any Limited
Partner nor any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this
Agreement, the Operating Partnership Agreement or the partnership
relationship established hereby or thereby in any business ventures of any
Indemnitee.

 

(c) Subject to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
7.5(b)_, but otherwise notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) the engaging in competitive activities by any Indemnitees
(other than the General Partner) in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_ is hereby approved by the Partnership and all Partners,
(ii) it shall be deemed not to be a breach of the General Partners fiduciary
duty or any other obligation of any type whatsoever of the General Partner for
the Indemnitees (other than the General Partner) to engage in such business
interests and activities in preference to or to the exclusion of the
Partnership and (iii) the General Partner and the Indemnitees shall have no
obligation to present business opportunities to the Partnership.

 



56 (d) The General Partner and any of its Affiliates may acquire Units
or other Partnership Securities in addition to those acquired on the Closing
Date and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be entitled to
exercise all rights of the General Partner or Limited Partner, as applicable,
relating to such Units or Partnership Securities.

(e) The term " _Affiliates_ " when used in  _Section_ __ _ 7.5(d)_ with
respect to the General Partner shall not include any Group Member or any
Subsidiary of any Group Member.

 

(f) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, to the
extent that provisions of _Sections 7.7_ ,  _7.8_ , _7.9_ , _7.10_ or other
Sections of this Agreement purport or are interpreted to have the effect of
restricting the fiduciary duties that might otherwise, as a result of Delaware
or other applicable law, be owed by the General Partner to the Partnership
and its Limited Partners, or to constitute a waiver or consent by the Limited
Partners to any such restriction, such provisions shall be inapplicable and
have no effect in determining whether the General Partner has complied with
its fiduciary duties in connection with determinations made by it under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_.

 

SECTION 7.6 _Loans from the General Partner; Loans or Contributions from
the Partnership; Contracts with Affiliates; Certain Restrictions on the
General Partner._

(a) The General Partner or its Affiliates may lend to any Group
Member, and any Group Member may borrow from the General Partner or any of
its Affiliates, funds needed or desired by the Group Member for such periods
of time and in such amounts as the General Partner may determine; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in any such case the lending party may not charge the
borrowing party interest at a rate greater than the rate that would be charged
the borrowing party or impose terms less favorable to the borrowing party than
would be charged or imposed on the borrowing party by unrelated lenders on
comparable loans made on an arms-length basis (without reference to the
lending partys financial abilities or guarantees). The borrowing party
shall reimburse the lending party for any costs (other than any additional
interest costs) incurred by the lending party in connection with the borrowing
of such funds. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(a)_ and  _Section_ __
_ 7.6(b)_, the term " _Group Member_ " shall include any Affiliate of a Group
Member that is controlled by the Group Member. No Group Member may lend funds
to the General Partner if not then a Group Member or any of its Affiliates
(other than another Group Member).

(b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any
Group Member may borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions
established in the sole discretion of the General Partner; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Partnership may not charge the Group Member interest at
a rate less than the rate that would be charged to the Group Member (without
reference to the General Partners financial abilities or guarantees) by
unrelated lenders on comparable loans. The foregoing authority shall be
exercised by the General Partner in its sole discretion and shall not create
any right or benefit in favor of any Group Member or any other Person.

 

(c) The General Partner may itself, or may enter into an agreement with any
of its Affiliates to, render services to a Group Member or to the General
Partner in the discharge of its duties as general partner of the Partnership.
Any services rendered to a Group Member by the

 



57  General Partner or any of its Affiliates shall be on terms that are fair and
reasonable to the Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that the requirements
of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_ shall be deemed satisfied as to (i) any
transaction approved by Special Approval, (ii) any transaction, the terms of
which are no less favorable to the Partnership Group than those generally
being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iii) any
transaction that, taking into account the totality of the relationships
between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be
particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership Group), is
equitable to the Partnership Group. The provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.4_
shall apply to the rendering of services described in this _Section_ __ _
7.6(c)_.

 

(d) The Partnership Group may transfer assets to joint ventures, other
partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies or other business
entities in which it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and
subject to such conditions as are consistent with this Agreement and
applicable law.

 

(e) Neither the General Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall sell,
transfer or convey any property to, or purchase any property from, the
Partnership, directly or indirectly, except pursuant to transactions that are
fair and reasonable to the Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(e)_ shall be deemed to be satisfied
as to (i) the transactions effected pursuant to the Contribution Agreement and
any other transactions described in or contemplated by the Registration
Statement, (ii) any transaction approved by Special Approval, (iii) any
transaction, the terms of which are no less favorable to the Partnership than
those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties,
or (iv) any transaction that, taking into account the totality of the
relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that
may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership), is
equitable to the Partnership. With respect to any contribution of assets to
the Partnership in exchange for Partnership Securities, the Conflicts
Committee, in determining whether the appropriate number of Partnership
Securities are being issued, may take into account, among other things, the
fair market value of the assets, the liquidated and contingent liabilities
assumed, the tax basis in the assets, the extent to which tax-only allocations
to the transferor will protect the existing partners of the Partnership
against a low tax basis, and such other factors as the Conflicts Committee
deems relevant under the circumstances.

(f) The General Partner and its Affiliates will have no obligation to
permit any Group Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner
and its Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from
time to time specifically dealing with such use, nor shall there be any
obligation on the part of the General Partner or its Affiliates to enter into
such contracts.

 

(g) Without limitation of _Sections 7.6(a)_ through _7.6(f)_ , and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the existence of
the conflicts of interest described in the Registration Statement are hereby
approved by all Partners.

 



58 SECTION 7.7 _Indemnification._

 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations
expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees
and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other
amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or
proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in
which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a
party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee; _provided_ ,
that in each case the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner that such
Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or (in the case of a Person other
than the General Partner) not opposed to, the best interests of the
Partnership and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe its conduct was unlawful; _provided_ , _further_ , no
indemnification pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall be available to
the General Partner with respect to its obligations incurred pursuant to the
Underwriting Agreement or the Contribution Agreement (other than obligations
incurred by the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or the Operating
Partnership). The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its
equivalent, shall not create a presumption that the Indemnitee acted in a
manner contrary to that specified above. Any indemnification pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership,
it being agreed that the General Partner shall not be personally liable for
such indemnification and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any
monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate such
indemnification.

 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.7(a)_ in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or
proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to
the final disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt by the Partnership of any undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be determined that the Indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this  _Section_ __ _
7.7_.

(c) The indemnification provided by this  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall be in
addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any
agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Limited Partner
Interests, as a matter of law or otherwise, both as to actions in the
Indemnitees capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other
capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in
such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee.

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General
Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General
Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the General Partner shall
determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expense that
may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnerships
activities or such Persons activities on behalf of the Partnership,
regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such
Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

(e) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_, the Partnership shall be
deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee
benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership
also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or
participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an

 



59  Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable
law shall constitute " _fines_ " within the meaning of _Section_ __ _
7.7(a)_; and action taken or omitted by it with respect to any employee
benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably
believed by it to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of
the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose which is in, or not opposed to,
the best interests of the Partnership.

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

 

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ because the Indemnitee had an interest in
the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(h) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall
not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

 

(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ or
any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the
right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the
Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such
Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
7.7_ as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal
with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole
or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of
when such claims may arise or be asserted.

SECTION 7.8 _Liability of Indemnitees._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
no Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the
Limited Partners, the Assignees or any other Persons who have acquired
interests in the Partnership Securities, for losses sustained or liabilities
incurred as a result of any act or omission if such Indemnitee acted in good
faith.

(b) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_, the General Partner may exercise any of the powers
granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it
hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and the General
Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part
of any such agent appointed by the General Partner in good faith.

 

(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other Indemnitee
acting in connection with the Partnerships business or affairs shall not be
liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith reliance on
the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the
extent that they restrict or otherwise modify the duties and liabilities of an
Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners
to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnitee.

 



60 (d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ or
any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect
the limitations on the liability to the Partnership, the Limited Partners, the
General Partner, and the Partnerships and General Partners and the
Operating General Partners directors, officers and employees under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.8_ as in effect immediately prior to such amendment,
modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to
matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification
or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

 

SECTION 7.9 _Resolution of Conflicts of Interest._

 

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or the Operating
Partnership Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or
arises between the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and the Partnership, the Operating Partnership, any Partner or any Assignee,
on the other, any resolution or course of action by the General Partner or
its Affiliates in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and
deemed approved by all Partners, and shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement, of the Operating Partnership Agreement, of any agreement
contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty stated or implied by law or
equity, if the resolution or course of action is, or by operation of this
Agreement is deemed to be, fair and reasonable to the Partnership. The General
Partner shall be authorized but not required in connection with its
resolution of such conflict of interest to seek Special Approval of such
resolution. Any conflict of interest and any resolution of such conflict of
interest shall be conclusively deemed fair and reasonable to the Partnership
if such conflict of interest or resolution is (i) approved by Special
Approval, (ii) on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than those
generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties
or (iii) fair to the Partnership, taking into account the totality of the
relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that
may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The General
Partner may also adopt a resolution or course of action that has not received
Special Approval. The General Partner (including the Conflicts Committee in
connection with Special Approval) shall be authorized in connection with its
determination of what is " _fair and reasonable_ " to the Partnership and in
connection with its resolution of any conflict of interest to consider (A) the
relative interests of any party to such conflict, agreement, transaction or
situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interest; (B) any
customary or accepted industry practices and any customary or historical
dealings with a particular Person; (C) any applicable generally accepted
accounting practices or principles; and (D) such additional factors as the
General Partner (including the Conflicts Committee) determines in its sole
discretion to be relevant, reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances.
Nothing contained in this Agreement, however, is intended to nor shall it be
construed to require the General Partner (including the Conflicts Committee)
to consider the interests of any Person other than the Partnership. In the
absence of bad faith by the General Partner, the resolution, action or terms
so made, taken or provided by the General Partner with respect to such matter
shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated herein or a breach of any standard of care or duty imposed herein
or therein or, to the extent permitted by law, under the Delaware Act or any
other law, rule or regulation.

(b) Whenever this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby
provides that the General Partner or any of its Affiliates is permitted or
required to make a decision (i) in its " _sole discretion_ " or " _discretion_
," that it deems " _necessary or appropriate_ " or

 



61  " _necessary or advisable_ " or under a grant of similar authority or
latitude, except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner or such
Affiliate shall be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it
desires and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any
interest of, or factors affecting, the Partnership, the Operating Partnership,
any Limited Partner or any Assignee, (ii) it may make such decision in its
sole discretion (regardless of whether there is a reference to " _sole
discretion_ " or " _discretion_ ") unless another express standard is provided
for, or (iii) in " _good faith_ " or under another express standard, the
General Partner or such Affiliate shall act under such express standard and
shall not be subject to any other or different standards imposed by this
Agreement, the Operating Partnership Agreement, any other agreement
contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or
regulation. In addition, any actions taken by the General Partner or such
Affiliate consistent with the standards of " _reasonable discretion_ " set
forth in the definition of Available Cash shall not constitute a breach of any
duty of the General Partner to the Partnership or the Limited Partners. The
General Partner shall have no duty, express or implied, to sell or otherwise
dispose of any asset of the Partnership Group other than in the ordinary
course of business.

 

(c) Whenever a particular transaction, arrangement or resolution of a
conflict of interest is required under this Agreement to be " _fair and
reasonable_ " to any Person, the fair and reasonable nature of such
transaction, arrangement or resolution shall be considered in the context of
all similar or related transactions.

 

(d) The Limited Partners hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of
the Partnership as a partner of a Group Member, to approve of actions by the
general partner of such Group Member similar to those actions permitted to be
taken by the General Partner pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_.

 

SECTION 7.10 _Other Matters Concerning the General Partner._

 

(a) The General Partner may rely and shall be protected in acting or
refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture
or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

 

(b) The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants,
appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants
and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in
reliance upon the opinion (including an Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as
to matters that the General Partner reasonably believes to be within such
Persons professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to
have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.

 

(c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its
powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized
officers, a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly
authorized officers of the Partnership.

 

(d) Any standard of care and duty imposed by this Agreement or under the
Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation shall be modified,
waived or limited, to the extent permitted by law, as required to permit the
General Partner to act under this

 



62  Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by this Agreement and to make
any decision pursuant to the authority prescribed in this Agreement, so long
as such action is reasonably believed by the General Partner to be in, or not
inconsistent with, the best interests of the Partnership.

SECTION 7.11 _Purchase or Sale of Partnership Securities._

Subject to _Section_ __ _ 16.5_, _Section_ __ _ 17.5_ and  _Section_ __ _
18.5_, the General Partner may cause the Partnership to purchase or otherwise
acquire Partnership Securities. As long as Partnership Securities are held by
any Group Member, such Partnership Securities shall not be considered
Outstanding for any purpose, except as otherwise provided herein. The General
Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner may also purchase or otherwise
acquire and sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership Securities for its
own account, subject to the provisions of _Articles IV_ , _X,_ _XVI_ , _XVII_
and _XVIII_.

 

SECTION 7.12 _Registration Rights of the General Partner and its
Affiliates._

 

(a) If (i) the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner
(including for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.12_, any Person that is an
Affiliate of the General Partner at the date hereof notwithstanding that it
may later cease to be an Affiliate of the General Partner) holds Partnership
Securities that it desires to sell and (ii) Rule 144 of the Securities Act
(or any successor rule or regulation to Rule 144) or another exemption from
registration is not available to enable such holder of Partnership Securities
(the " _Holder_ ") to dispose of the number of Partnership Securities it
desires to sell at the time it desires to do so without registration under the
Securities Act, then upon the request of the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates, the Partnership shall file with the Commission as promptly as
practicable after receiving such request, and use all reasonable efforts to
cause to become effective and remain effective for a period of not less than
six months following its effective date or such shorter period as shall
terminate when all Partnership Securities covered by such registration
statement have been sold, a registration statement under the Securities Act
registering the offering and sale of the number of Partnership Securities
specified by the Holder;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall
not be required to effect more than three registrations pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.12(a)_; and _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that if the
Conflicts Committee determines in its good faith judgment that a postponement
of the requested registration for up to six months would be in the best
interests of the Partnership and its Partners due to a pending transaction,
investigation or other event, the filing of such registration statement or
the effectiveness thereof may be deferred for up to six months, but not
thereafter. In connection with any registration pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Partnership shall promptly prepare and file (x) such
documents as may be necessary to register or qualify the securities subject to
such registration under the securities laws of such states as the Holder shall
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such qualification shall
be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, the Partnership
would become subject to general service of process or to taxation or
qualification to do business as a foreign corporation or partnership doing
business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of such registration, and
(y) such documents as may be necessary to apply for listing or to list the
Partnership Securities subject to such registration on such National
Securities Exchange as the Holder shall reasonably request, and do any and
all other acts and things that may reasonably be necessary or advisable to
enable the Holder to consummate a public sale of such Partnership

 



63  Securities in such states. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.12(c)_,
all costs and expenses of any such registration and offering (other than the
underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership,
without reimbursement by the Holder.

(b) If the Partnership shall at any time propose to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act for an offering of equity securities of the
Partnership for cash (other than an offering relating solely to an employee
benefit plan), the Partnership shall use all reasonable efforts to include
such number or amount of securities held by the Holder in such registration
statement as the Holder shall request. If the proposed offering pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.12(b)_ shall be an underwritten offering, then, in the
event that the managing underwriter or managing underwriters of such offering
advise the Partnership and the Holder in writing that in their opinion the
inclusion of all or some of the Holders Partnership Securities would
adversely and materially affect the success of the offering, the Partnership
shall include in such offering only that number or amount, if any, of
securities held by the Holder which, in the opinion of the managing
underwriter or managing underwriters, will not so adversely and materially
affect the offering. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.12(c)_, all
costs and expenses of any such registration and offering (other than the
underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership,
without reimbursement by the Holder.

(c) If underwriters are engaged in connection with any registration
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 7.12_, the Partnership shall provide
indemnification, representations, covenants, opinions and other assurance to
the underwriters in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such
underwriters. Further, in addition to and not in limitation of the
Partnerships obligation under _Section_ __ _ 7.7_, the Partnership shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless the Holder,
its officers, directors and each Person who controls the Holder (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) and any agent thereof (collectively, "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") against any losses, claims, demands, actions, causes
of action, assessments, damages, liabilities (joint or several), costs and
expenses (including interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements), resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by the Indemnified
Persons, directly or indirectly, under the Securities Act or otherwise
(hereinafter referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 7.12(c)_ as a " _Claim_ " and
in the plural as " _Claims_ ") based upon, arising out of or resulting from
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in any registration statement under which any Partnership Securities
were registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or Blue Sky
laws, in any preliminary prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of
such registration statement), or in any summary or final prospectus or in any
amendment or supplement thereto (if used during the period the Partnership is
required to keep the registration statement current), or arising out of,
based upon or resulting from the omission or alleged omission to state therein
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Partnership shall not be liable to any Indemnified Person to the extent that
any such Claim arises out of, is based upon or results from an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
such registration statement, such preliminary, summary or final prospectus or
such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Partnership by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Person specifically for use in the preparation thereof.

 



64 (d) The provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.12(a)_ and  _7.12(b)_ shall
continue to be applicable with respect to the General Partner (and any of the
General Partners Affiliates) after it ceases to be a Partner of the
Partnership, during a period of two years subsequent to the effective date of
such cessation and for so long thereafter as is required for the Holder to
sell all of the Partnership Securities with respect to which it has requested
during such two-year period inclusion in a registration statement otherwise
filed or that a registration statement be filed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Partnership shall not be required to file successive registration
statements covering the same Partnership Securities for which registration
was demanded during such two-year period. The provisions of _Section_ __ _
7.12(c)_ shall continue in effect thereafter.

 

(e) Any request to register Partnership Securities pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.12_ shall (i) specify the Partnership Securities intended
to be offered and sold by the Person making the request, (ii) express such
Persons present intent to offer such shares for distribution, (iii) describe
the nature or method of the proposed offer and sale of Partnership
Securities, and (iv) contain the undertaking of such Person to provide all
such information and materials and take all action as may be required in order
to permit the Partnership to comply with all applicable requirements in
connection with the registration of such Partnership Securities.

SECTION 7.13 _Reliance by Third Parties._

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing
with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General Partner and
any officer of NuStar GP authorized by NuStar GP to act on behalf of and in
the name of the General Partner on behalf of and in the name of the
Partnership has full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use
in any manner any and all assets of the Partnership and to enter into any
authorized contracts on behalf of the Partnership, and such Person shall be
entitled to deal with the General Partner or any such officer as if it were
the Partnerships sole party in interest, both legally and beneficially. Each
Limited Partner hereby waives any and all defenses or other remedies that may
be available against such Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of
the General Partner or any such officer in connection with any such dealing.
In no event shall any Person dealing with the General Partner or any such
officer or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of the
Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or
expedience of any act or action of the General Partner or any such officer or
its representatives. Each and every certificate, document or other instrument
executed on behalf of the Partnership by the General Partner or its
representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person
relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (a) at the time of the execution
and delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was
in full force and effect, (b) the Person executing and delivering such
certificate, document or instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so
for and on behalf of the Partnership and (c) such certificate, document or
instrument was duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon the Partnership.

 



65 ARTICLE VIII

 

BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS

 

SECTION 8.1 _Records and Accounting._

 

The General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept at the principal office of
the Partnership appropriate books and records with respect to
the Partnerships business, including all books and records necessary to
provide to the Limited Partners any information required to be provided
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4(a)_. Any books and records maintained by or on
behalf of the Partnership in the regular course of its business, including

Limited Partners. Notwithstanding any other provision herein contained, for
the purposes of computing the adjustments under Section 743(b) of the Code,
the General Partner shall be authorized (but not required) to adopt a
convention whereby the price paid by a transferee of a Limited Partner
Interest will be deemed to be the lowest quoted closing price of the Limited
Partner Interests on any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited
Partner Interests are traded during the calendar month in which such transfer
is deemed to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)_ without regard to the
actual price paid by such transferee.

 

(b) The Partnership shall elect to deduct expenses incurred in organizing

SECTION 9.3 _Tax Controversies._

(a) Subject to the provisions hereof, the General Partner is designated as
the Tax Matters Partner (as defined in the Code) and is authorized and
required to represent the Partnership (at the Partnerships expense) in
connection with all examinations of the Partnerships affairs by tax
authorities, including resulting administrative and judicial proceedings, and
to expend Partnership funds for professional services and costs associated
therewith. Each Partner agrees to cooperate with the General Partner and to do
or refrain from doing any or all things reasonably required by the General
Partner to conduct such proceedings.

(b) With respect to tax returns filed for taxable years beginning on or
after December 31, 2017, the General Partner (or its designee) will be
designated as the "partnership representative" in accordance with the rules
prescribed pursuant to Section 6223 of the Code and shall have the sole
authority to act on behalf of the Partnership in connection with all
examinations of the Partnerships affairs by tax authorities, including

resulting from the allocation or distribution of income to any Partner or
Assignee (including, without limitation, by reason of Section 1446 of the
Code), the amount withheld may at the discretion of the General Partner be
treated by the Partnership as a distribution of cash pursuant to _Section_ __

18.3_ in the amount of such withholding from such Partner.

ADMISSION OF PARTNERS 

SECTION 10.1 _Admission of Limited Partners._

 

Each Limited Partner admitted to the Partnership immediately prior to the
adoption of this Agreement hereby continues as a Limited Partner upon the
adoption of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.2 _Admission of Substituted Limited Partner._

 

By transfer of a Limited Partner Interest in accordance with _Article IV_ ,
the transferor shall be deemed to have given the transferee the right to seek
admission as a Substituted Limited Partner subject to the conditions of, and
in the manner permitted under, this Agreement. A transferor of a Certificate
representing a Limited Partner Interest shall, however, only have the
authority to convey to a purchaser or other transferee who does not execute
and deliver a Transfer Application (a) the right to negotiate such Certificate
to a purchaser or other transferee and (b) the right to transfer the right to
request admission as a Substituted Limited Partner to such purchaser or other
transferee in respect of the transferred Limited Partner Interests. Each
transferee of a Limited Partner Interest (including any nominee holder or an
agent acquiring such Limited Partner Interest for the account of another
Person) who executes and delivers a Transfer Application shall, by virtue of
such execution and delivery, be an Assignee and be deemed to have applied to
become a Substituted Limited Partner with respect to the Limited Partner
Interests so transferred to such Person. Such Assignee shall become a
Substituted Limited Partner (x) at such time as the General Partner consents
thereto, which consent may be given or withheld in the General Partners
discretion, and (y) when any such admission is shown on the books and records
of the Partnership. If such consent is withheld, such transferee shall be an
Assignee. An Assignee shall have an interest in the Partnership equivalent to
that of a Limited Partner with respect to allocations and distributions,
including liquidating distributions, of the Partnership. With respect to
voting rights attributable to Limited Partner Interests that are held by
Assignees, the General Partner shall be deemed to be the Limited Partner with
respect thereto and shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such
Limited Partner Interests on any matter, vote such Limited Partner Interests
at the written direction of the Assignee who is the Record Holder of such
Limited Partner Interests. If no such written direction is received, such
Limited Partner Interests will not be voted. An Assignee shall have no other
rights of a Limited Partner.

 



68 SECTION 10.3 _Admission of Successor General Partner._

 

A successor General Partner approved pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ or
_11.2_ or the transferee of or successor to all of the General Partner

successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as the General
Partner, effective immediately prior to the withdrawal or removal of the
predecessor or transferring General Partner pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.1_
or _11.2_ or the transfer of the General Partner Interest pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.6_,  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such successor shall
be admitted to the Partnership until compliance with the terms of _Section_ __
_ 4.6_ has occurred and such successor has executed and delivered such other
documents or instruments as may be required to effect such admission. Any
such successor shall, subject to the terms hereof, carry on the business of
the members of the Partnership Group without dissolution.

 

SECTION 10.4 _Admission of Additional Limited Partners._

 

(a) A Person (other than a Substituted Limited Partner) who makes a Capital
Contribution to the Partnership in accordance with this Agreement or is
otherwise being admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner shall be
admitted to the Partnership as an Additional Limited Partner only upon
furnishing to the General Partner (i) evidence of acceptance in form
satisfactory to the General Partner of all of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including the power of attorney granted in _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,
and (ii) such other documents or instruments as may be required in the
discretion of the General Partner to effect such Persons admission as an
Additional Limited Partner.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 10.4_,
no Person shall be admitted as an Additional Limited Partner without the
consent of the General Partner, which consent may be given or withheld in the
General Partners discretion. The admission of any Person as an Additional
Limited Partner shall become effective on the date upon which the name of
such Person is recorded as such in the books and records of the Partnership,
following the consent of the General Partner to such admission.

 

SECTION 10.5 _Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited
Partnership._

 

To effect the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the General Partner
shall take all steps necessary and appropriate under the Delaware Act to
amend the records of the Partnership to reflect such admission and, if
necessary, to prepare as soon as practicable an amendment to this Agreement
and, if required by law, the General Partner shall prepare and file an
amendment to the Certificate of Limited Partnership, and the General Partner
may for this purpose, among others, exercise the power of attorney granted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_.

 



69 ARTICLE XI

 

WITHDRAWAL OR REMOVAL OF PARTNERS

 

SECTION 11.1 _Withdrawal of the General Partner._

 

(a) The General Partner shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the
Partnership upon the occurrence of any one of the following events (each such
event herein referred to as an " _Event of Withdrawal_ "):

 

(i) The General Partner voluntarily withdraws from the Partnership by
giving notice to the other Partners;

(ii) The General Partner transfers all of its rights as General Partner
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.6_;

(iii) The General Partner is removed pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.2_;

(iv) The General Partner (A) makes a general assignment for the benefit of
creditors; (B) files a voluntary bankruptcy petition for relief under Chapter
7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (C) files a petition or answer seeking
for itself a liquidation, dissolution or similar relief (but not a
reorganization) under any law; (D) files an answer or other pleading admitting
or failing to contest the material allegations of a petition filed against the
General Partner in a proceeding of the type described in clauses (A)-(C) of
this _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)(iv)_; or (E) seeks, consents to or acquiesces in
the appointment of a trustee (but not a debtor-in-possession), receiver or
liquidator of the General Partner or of all or any substantial part of its
properties;

 

(v) A final and non-appealable order of relief under Chapter 7 of the
United States Bankruptcy Code is entered by a court with appropriate
jurisdiction pursuant to a voluntary or involuntary petition by or against the
General Partner; or

 

(vi) (A) in the event the General Partner is a corporation, a certificate
of dissolution or its equivalent is filed for the General Partner, or 90 days
expire after the date of notice to the General Partner of revocation of its
charter without a reinstatement of its charter, under the laws of its state of
incorporation; (B) in the event the General Partner is a partnership or a
limited liability company, the dissolution and commencement of winding up of
the General Partner; (C) in the event the General Partner is acting in such
capacity by virtue of being a trustee of a trust, the termination of the
trust; (D) in the event the General Partner is a natural person, his death or
adjudication of incompetency; and (E) otherwise in the event of the
termination of the General Partner.

 

If an Event of Withdrawal specified in _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)(iv)_, _(v)_ or
_(vi)(A)_ , _(B)_ ,  _(C)_ or _(E)_ occurs, the withdrawing General Partner
shall give notice to the Limited Partners within 30 days after such
occurrence. The Partners hereby agree that only the Events of Withdrawal
described in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ shall result in the withdrawal of
the General Partner from the Partnership.

 



70 (b) Withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership upon
the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall not constitute a breach of
this Agreement under the following circumstances: (i) at any time that the
General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 days advance
notice to the Unitholders, such withdrawal to take effect on the date
specified in such notice; or (ii) at any time that the General Partner ceases
to be the General Partner pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)(ii)_ or is
removed pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.2_. The withdrawal of the General
Partner from the Partnership upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal
shall also constitute the withdrawal of the General Partner as general partner
of the other Group Members. If the General Partner gives a notice of
withdrawal pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)(i)_, the holders of a Unit
Majority may, prior to the effective date of such withdrawal, elect a
successor General Partner. The Person so elected as successor General Partner
shall automatically become the successor general partner of the other Group
Members of which the General Partner is a general partner. If, prior to the
effective date of the General Partners withdrawal, a successor is not
selected by the Unitholders as provided herein or the Partnership does not
receive a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel, the Partnership shall be dissolved in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.1_. Any successor General Partner elected
in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ shall be subject to
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.3_.

 

SECTION 11.2 _Removal of the General Partner._

 

The General Partner may be removed if such removal is approved by the
Unitholders holding at least a Unit Majority (excluding Units held by
the General Partner and its Affiliates). Any such action by such holders for
removal of the General Partner must also provide for the election of a
successor General Partner by the Unitholders holding a Unit Majority
(excluding Units held by the General Partner and its Affiliates). Such
removal shall be effective immediately following the admission of a successor
General Partner pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3_. The removal of the General
Partner shall also automatically constitute the removal of the General
Partner as general partner of the other Group Members of which the General
Partner is a general partner, if any. If a Person is elected as a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.2_,
such Person shall, upon admission pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3_,
automatically become a successor general partner of the other Group Members of
which the General Partner is a general partner. The right of the holders of
Outstanding Units to remove the General Partner shall not exist or be
exercised unless the Partnership has received an opinion opining as to the
matters covered by a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel. Any successor General
Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 11.2_
shall be subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.3_.

 

SECTION 11.3 _Interest of Departing Partner and Successor General
Partner._

 

(a) In the event of (i) withdrawal of the General Partner under
circumstances where such withdrawal does not violate this Agreement or (ii)
removal of the General Partner by the holders of Outstanding Units under
circumstances where Cause does not exist, if a successor General Partner is
elected in accordance with the terms of  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ or _11.2_ ,
the Departing Partner shall have the option exercisable prior to the effective
date of the departure of such Departing Partner to require its successor to
purchase its General Partner Interest and its general partner interest (or
equivalent interest) in the other Group Members, if any (collectively, the "
_Combined Interest_ ") in exchange for an amount in cash equal to the fair
market value of such Combined Interest, such amount to be determined and
payable as of the effective date of its

 



71  departure. If the General Partner is removed by the Unitholders under
circumstances where Cause exists or if the General Partner withdraws under
circumstances where such withdrawal violates this Agreement, and if a
successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of _Section_
__ _ 11.1_ or _11.2_ , such successor shall have the option, exercisable
prior to the effective date of the departure of such Departing Partner, to
purchase the Combined Interest for such fair market value of such Combined
Interest of the Departing Partner. In either event, the Departing Partner
shall be entitled to receive all reimbursements due such Departing
Partner pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, including any employee-related
liabilities (including severance liabilities), incurred in connection with the
termination of any employees employed by the Departing Partner for the benefit
of the Partnership or the other Group Members.

For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.3(a)_, the fair market value of
a Departing Partners Combined Interest shall be determined by agreement
between the Departing Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within
30 days after the effective date of such Departing Partners departure, by an
independent investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by
the Departing Partner and its successor, which, in turn, may rely on other
experts, and the determination of which shall be conclusive as to such matter.
If such parties cannot agree upon one independent investment banking firm or
other independent expert within 45 days after the effective date of such
departure, then the Departing Partner shall designate an independent
investment banking firm or other independent expert, the Departing Partners
successor shall designate an independent investment banking firm or other
independent expert, and such firms or experts shall mutually select a third
independent investment banking firm or independent expert, which
third independent investment banking firm or other independent expert shall
determine the fair market value of the Combined Interest of the Departing
Partner. In making its determination, such third independent investment
banking firm or other independent expert may consider the then current
trading price of Units on any National Securities Exchange on which Units are
then listed, the value of the Partnerships assets, the rights and obligations
of the Departing Partner and other factors it may deem relevant.

(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 11.3(a)_, the Departing Partner (or its transferee) shall
become a Limited Partner and its Combined Interest shall be converted into
Common Units pursuant to a valuation made by an investment banking firm or
other independent expert selected pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.3(a)_,
without reduction in such Partnership Interest (but subject to proportionate
dilution by reason of the admission of its successor). Any successor General
Partner shall indemnify the Departing Partner (or its transferee) as to all
debts and liabilities of the Partnership arising on or after the date on which
the Departing Partner (or its transferee) becomes a Limited Partner. For
purposes of this Agreement, conversion of the Combined Interest of the
Departing Partner to Common Units will be characterized as if the Departing
Partner (or its transferee) contributed its Combined Interest to the
Partnership in exchange for the newly issued Common Units. 

SECTION 11.4 _Withdrawal of Limited Partners._

 

No Limited Partner shall have any right to withdraw from the Partnership;
_provided_ , _however_ , that when a transferee of a Limited Partners
Limited Partner Interest becomes a Record Holder of the Limited Partner
Interest so transferred, such transferring Limited Partner shall cease to be a
Limited Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interest so transferred.

 



72 ARTICLE XII

 

DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

 

SECTION 12.1 _Dissolution._

 

The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of Substituted Limited
Partners or Additional Limited Partners or by the admission of a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the

shall not be dissolved and such successor General Partner shall continue the
business of the Partnership. The Partnership shall dissolve, and (subject to
_Section_ __ _ 12.2_) its affairs shall be wound up, upon:

11.1(b)_ or _11.2_ and such successor is admitted to the Partnership pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_;

(c) an election to dissolve the Partnership by the General Partner that
is approved by the holders of a Unit Majority;

(d) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the

(e) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets and properties of

SECTION 12.2 _Continuation of the Business of the Partnership After
Dissolution._  

Upon (a) dissolution of the Partnership following an Event of Withdrawal
caused by the withdrawal or removal of the General Partner as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)(i)_ or (iii) and the failure of the Partners to select
a successor to such Departing Partner pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ or
_11.2_ , then within 90 days thereafter, or (b) dissolution of the
Partnership upon an event constituting an Event of Withdrawal as defined in
_Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)(iv)_, (v) or (vi), then, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, within 180 days thereafter, the holders of a Unit Majority
may elect to reconstitute the Partnership and continue its business on the
same terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement by forming a new limited
partnership on terms identical to those set forth in this Agreement and
having as the successor general partner a Person approved by the holders of a
Unit Majority. Unless such an election is made within the applicable time
period as set forth above, the Partnership shall conduct only
activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election is so made,
then:

(a) the reconstituted Partnership shall continue until dissolved in
accordance with this _Article XII_ ;

 



73 (b) if the successor General Partner is not the former General
Partner, then the interest of the former General Partner shall be treated in
the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.3_; and

 

(c) all necessary steps shall be taken to cancel this Agreement and the
Certificate of Limited Partnership and to enter into and, as necessary, to
file a new partnership agreement and certificate of limited partnership, and
the successor general partner may for this purpose exercise the powers of
attorney granted the General Partner pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_;
_provided_ , that the right of the holders of a Unit Majority to approve a
successor General Partner and to reconstitute and to continue the business of
the Partnership shall not exist and may not be exercised unless the
Partnership has received an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the exercise of the
right would not result in the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner
and (y) neither the Partnership, the reconstituted limited partnership nor
the Operating Partnership would be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for federal income tax
purposes upon the exercise of such right to continue.

 

SECTION 12.3 _Liquidator._

 

Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the Partnership is continued under
an election to reconstitute and continue the Partnership pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.2_, the General Partner shall select one or more Persons to
act as Liquidator. The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall be
entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved by
holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units. The Liquidator
(if other than the General Partner) shall agree not to resign at any time
without 15 days prior notice and may be removed at any time, with or without
cause, by notice of removal approved by holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Common Units. Upon dissolution, removal or resignation of the
Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed
to all rights, powers and duties of the original Liquidator) shall within 30
days thereafter be approved by holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Common Units. The right to approve a successor or substitute
Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any
such successor or substitute Liquidator approved in the manner herein
provided. Except as expressly provided in this _Article XII_ , the Liquidator
approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without
further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the
powers conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of this Agreement
(but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and
otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than the limitation on
sale set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_) to the extent necessary or
desirable in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator to carry out the duties
and functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during such period of time
as shall be reasonably required in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator
to complete the winding up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for
herein.

 



74 SECTION 12.4 _Liquidation._

 

The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Partnership,
discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner
and over such period as the Liquidator determines to be in the best interest
of the Partners, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the
following:

 

(a) _Disposition of Assets_. The assets may be disposed of by public or
private sale or by distribution in kind to one or more Partners on such terms
as the Liquidator and such Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is
distributed in kind, the Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for
purposes of _Section_ __ _ 12.4(c)_ to have received cash equal to its fair
market value; and contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions
must be made to the other Partners. The Liquidator may, in its absolute
discretion, defer liquidation or distribution of the Partnerships assets for
a reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution of
all or some of the Partnerships assets would be impractical or would cause
undue loss to the Partners. The Liquidator may, in its absolute discretion,
distribute the Partnerships assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it
determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the
Partners.

 

(b) _Discharge of Liabilities_. Liabilities of the Partnership include
amounts owed to the Liquidator as compensation for serving in such capacity
(subject to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 12.3_) and amounts owed to Partners
other than in respect of their distribution rights under _Article VI_. With
respect to any liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured or is
otherwise not yet due and payable, the Liquidator shall either settle such
claim for such amount as it thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash
or other assets to provide for its payment. When paid, any unused portion of
the reserve shall be distributed as additional liquidation proceeds.

 

(c) _Liquidation Distributions_. All property and all cash in excess of
that required to discharge liabilities as provided in _Section_ __ _
12.4(b)_ shall be distributed to the Partners in accordance with, and to the
extent of, the positive balances in their respective Capital Accounts, as
determined after taking into account all Capital Account adjustments (other
than those made by reason of distributions pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
12.4(c)_) for the taxable year of the Partnership during which the liquidation
of the Partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being determined
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such
distribution shall be made by the end of such taxable year (or, if later,
within 90 days after said date of such occurrence); _provided_  that the
Stated Liquidation Preference and any accumulated and unpaid Series A
Distributions, Series B Distributions and Series C Distributions shall be paid
prior to making any distributions pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 12.4(c)_.

SECTION 12.5 _Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership._

 

Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 12.4_ in connection with the liquidation of the
Partnership, the Partnership shall be terminated and the Certificate of
Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign
limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware shall
be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the
Partnership shall be taken.

 

SECTION 12.6 _Return of Contributions._

 

The General Partner shall not be personally liable for, and shall have no
obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to
enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital Contributions of the
Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being expressly
understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets.

 



75 SECTION 12.7 _Waiver of Partition._

 

To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby waives any right
to partition of the Partnership property.

 

SECTION 12.8 _Capital Account Restoration._

Partner or Assignee, may amend any provision of this Agreement and execute,
swear to, acknowledge, deliver, file and record whatever documents may be
required in connection therewith, to reflect:

 

(a) a change in the name of the Partnership, the location of the principal
place of business of the Partnership, the registered agent of the Partnership
or the registered office of the Partnership;

association taxable as a corporation or otherwise taxed as an entity for
federal income tax purposes;

Except as provided in _Sections 13.1_ and _13.3_ , _Article XVI_ , _Article
XVII_ and _Article XVIII_ , all amendments to this Agreement shall be made in
accordance with the following requirements. Amendments to this Agreement may
be proposed only by or with the consent of the General Partner, which consent
may be given or withheld in its sole discretion. A proposed amendment shall
be effective upon its approval by the holders of a Unit Majority, unless a
greater or different percentage is required under this Agreement or by
Delaware law. Each proposed amendment that requires the approval of the
holders of a specified percentage of Outstanding Units shall be set forth in
a writing that contains the text of the proposed

 



77  amendment. If such an amendment is proposed, the General Partner shall seek
the written approval of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Units or call
a meeting of the Unitholders to consider and vote on such proposed amendment.
The General Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon final adoption of any
such proposed amendments.

 

SECTION 13.3 _Amendment Requirements._

 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 13.1_ and _13.2_ , no
provision of this Agreement that establishes a percentage of Outstanding
Units (including Units deemed owned by the General Partner) required to take
any action shall be amended, altered, changed, repealed or rescinded in any
respect that would have the effect of reducing such voting percentage unless
such amendment is approved by the written consent or the affirmative vote of
holders of Outstanding Units whose aggregate Outstanding Units constitute not
less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 13.1_ and _13.2_ , no
amendment to this Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations of any Limited
Partner without its consent, unless such shall be deemed to have occurred as a
result of an amendment approved pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.3(c)_, (ii)
enlarge the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of,
or reduce in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise
payable to, the General Partner or any of its Affiliates without its consent,
which consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion, (iii) change
_Section_ __ _ 12.1(a)_ or _12.1(c)_ , or (iv) change the term of the
Partnership or, except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)_, give any
Person the right to dissolve the Partnership.

(c) Except as otherwise provided and without limitation of the General

approval of any Partners or Assignees as contemplated in _Section_ __ _
13.1_, any amendment that would have a material adverse effect on the rights
or preferences of any class of Partnership Interests in relation to other
classes of Partnership Interests must be approved by the holders of not less
than a majority of the Outstanding Partnership Interests of the class
affected.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for
amendments pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 13.1_ and except as otherwise
provided by _Section_ __ _ 14.3(b)_, no amendments shall become effective
without the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Common
Units unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
such amendment will not affect the limited liability of any Limited Partner
under applicable law.

 

(e) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 13.1_, this _Section_ __ _ 13.3_
shall only be amended with the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the
Outstanding Units.

SECTION 13.4 _Meetings._

 

(a) All acts of Limited Partners to be taken pursuant to this Agreement
shall be taken in the manner provided in this  _Article XIII_. Special
meetings of the Limited Partners may be called by the General Partner or by
Limited Partners owning 20% or more of the Outstanding Limited Partner
Interests of the class or classes for which a meeting is proposed. Limited
Partners shall call a special meeting by delivering to the General Partner one
or more requests in

 



78  writing stating that the signing Limited Partners wish to call a special
meeting and indicating the general or specific purposes for which the special
meeting is to be called. Within 60 days after receipt of such a call from
Limited Partners or within such greater time as may be reasonably necessary
for the Partnership to comply with any statutes, rules, regulations, listing
agreements or similar requirements governing the holding of a meeting or the
solicitation of proxies for use at such a meeting, the General Partner shall
send a notice of the meeting to the Limited Partners either directly or
indirectly through the Transfer Agent or another agent. A meeting shall be
held at a time and place determined by the General Partner on a date not less
than 10 days nor more than 60 days after the mailing of notice of the meeting.
Limited Partners shall not vote on matters that would cause the Limited
Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the
business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited
Partners limited liability under the Delaware Act or the law of any other
state in which the Partnership is qualified to do business.

(b) (i) An annual meeting of the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units
for the election of Directors to the Board of Directors and such other
matters as the General Partner shall submit to a vote of the Limited Partners
holding Outstanding Units shall be held in April of each year beginning in
2019 or at such other date and time as may be fixed from time to time by the
General Partner at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may
be fixed from time to time by the General Partner and all as stated in the
notice of the meeting. Notice of the annual meeting shall be given in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 13.5_ not less than 10 days nor more than 60
days prior to the date of such meeting.

 

(ii) The Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units shall vote together as
a single class for the election of Directors to the Board of Directors. The
Limited Partners described in the immediately preceding sentence shall elect
by a plurality of the votes cast at such meeting persons to serve as Directors
who are nominated in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
13.4(b)_. The exercise by a Limited Partner of the right to elect the
Directors and any other rights afforded to such Limited Partner under this
_Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)_ shall be in such Limited Partners capacity as a
limited partner of the Partnership and shall not cause a Limited Partner to be
deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business and
affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize such Limited Partners limited
liability under the Delaware Act or the law of any other state in which the
Partnership is qualified to do business.

 

(iii) The number of Directors on the Board of Directors shall be nine,
unless otherwise fixed from time to time pursuant to a resolution adopted by
a majority of the Directors then in office. Immediately prior to the
effectiveness of this Agreement, the number of Directors on the Board of
Directors was six and, upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, each person
serving as a Director immediately prior to the effectiveness of this Agreement
shall continue as a Director. Until such time as a Triggering Resolution has
been adopted, each Director shall be elected to serve a term of one year to
expire at the next annual meeting.

(iv) This _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)(iv)_ shall become effective upon the
adoption of a Triggering Resolution, and no portion of this _Section_ __ _
13.4(b)(iv)_ shall be effective unless and until a Triggering Resolution has
been adopted. The Directors shall be divided into

 



79  three groups by a majority of the Directors then in office, Group I, Group
II, and Group III. The number of Directors in each group shall be the whole
number contained in the quotient arrived at by dividing the authorized number
of Directors by three, and if a fraction is also contained in such quotient,
then if such fraction is one-third, the extra Director shall be a member of
Group I and if the fraction is two-thirds, one of the extra Directors shall
be a member of Group I and the other shall be a member of Group II. Each
Director shall serve for a term ending as provided herein; provided,
however, that the Directors designated in the Triggering Resolution to Group
I shall serve for an initial term that expires at the annual meeting of
Limited Partners held immediately following the Triggering Resolution, the
Directors designated in the Triggering Resolution to Group II shall serve for
an initial term that expires at the second annual meeting of Limited Partners
held following the Triggering Resolution, and the Directors designated in the
Triggering Resolution to Group III shall serve for an initial term that
expires at the third annual meeting of Limited Partners held following the
Triggering Resolution. At each succeeding annual meeting of Limited Partners
beginning with the first annual meeting following the Triggering Resolution,
successors to the Directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be
elected for a three-year term.

 

(v) Each Director shall hold office for the term for which such Director is
elected and thereafter until such Directors successor shall have been duly
elected and qualified, or until such Directors earlier death, resignation or
removal. If, following a Triggering Resolution, the number of Directors is
changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by a majority of the
Directors then in office among the groups so as to maintain the number of
Directors in each group as nearly equal as possible, and any additional
Director of any group elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in
such group shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining
term of that group, but in no case will a decrease in the number of Directors
shorten the term of any incumbent Director. A majority of the
remaining Directors may nominate and elect a person to fill any vacancy on
the Board of Directors (including, without limitation, any vacancy caused by
an increase in the number of Directors on the Board of Directors). Any
Director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the
number of Directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his
predecessor. Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 13.11_ of this Agreement, a
Director may be removed only at a meeting of the Limited Partners upon the
affirmative vote of Limited Partners holding a Unit Majority; provided,
however, a Director may only be removed if, at the same meeting, Limited
Partners holding a Unit Majority nominate a replacement Director (and any
such nomination shall not be subject to the nomination procedures otherwise
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 13.4_), and Limited Partners holding a Unit
Majority also vote to elect a replacement Director, and, provided,
further, following a Triggering Resolution, a Director may only be removed
for Cause.

(vi) (A) (I) Nominations of persons for election of Directors to the Board
of Directors may be made at an annual meeting of the Limited Partners only
pursuant to the General Partners notice of meeting (or any supplement
thereto) (a) by or at the direction of a majority of the Directors or (b) by
a Limited Partner, or a group of Limited Partners, that holds or beneficially
owns, and has continuously held or beneficially owned without interruption for
the prior two (2) years, 5% of the Outstanding Units (in either case, a

 



80  " _Limited Partner Group_ ") if each member of the Limited Partner Group was
a Limited Partner at the time the notice provided for in this  _Section_ __ _
13.4(b)(vi)_ is delivered to the General Partner, and if the Limited Partner
Group complies with the notice procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _
13.4(b)(vi)_.

 

(II) For any nominations brought before an annual meeting by a Limited
Partner Group pursuant to clause (b) of paragraph (A)(I) of this _Section_ __
_ 13.4(b)(vi)_, the Limited Partner Group must have given timely notice
thereof in writing to the General Partner. To be timely, a Limited Partner
Groups notice shall be delivered to the General Partner not later than the
close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day, nor earlier than the close of
business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day, prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting (provided, however, that
in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days
before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice by
the Limited Partner Group must be so delivered not earlier than the close of
business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting
and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th)
day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on
which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the
Partnership or the General Partner). For purposes of the 2019 annual meeting,
the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting shall be deemed
to be April 30, 2019. In no event shall the public announcement of an
adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period
(or extend any time period) for the giving of a Limited Partner Groups
notice as described above. Such Limited Partner Groups notice shall set
forth: (a) as to each person whom the Limited Partner Group proposes to
nominate for election as a Director (i) all information relating to
such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for
election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in
each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
and (ii) such persons written consent to being named in the proxy statement
as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected; and (b) as to each
member of the Limited Partner Group giving the notice and the beneficial
owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made (i) the name and address
of such Limited Partners, as they appear on the Partnerships books and
records, and of such beneficial owners, (ii) the class or series and number
of Partnership Securities which are owned beneficially and of record by such
Limited Partners and such beneficial owners, (iii) a description of any
agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination
between or among any or all members of such Limited Partner Group and/or such
beneficial owners, any of their respective Affiliates or associates, and any
others acting in concert with any of the foregoing, including each
nominee, (iv) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding
(including any derivative or

 



81  short positions, profit interests, options, warrants, equity appreciation or
similar rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned Partnership
Securities) that has been entered into as of the date of the Limited Partner
Groups notice by, or on behalf of, any members of such Limited Partner Group
and such beneficial owners, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss
to, manage risk or benefit of price changes for, or increase or decrease the
voting power of, such Limited Partners and such beneficial owner, with respect
to Partnership Securities, (v) a representation that each member of the
Limited Partner Group is a Limited Partner entitled to vote at such meeting
and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such
nomination, (vi) a representation whether any member of the Limited Partner
Group or the beneficial owners, if any, intend or are part of a group which
intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of
at least the percentage of the Partnerships Outstanding Units required to
elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from Limited
Partners in support of such nomination, and (vii) any other information
relating to any member of such Limited Partner Group and beneficial owners, if
any, required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required
to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for the election of
directors in an election contest pursuant to and in accordance with Section
14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. The General Partner may require any proposed nominee to furnish
such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the
eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a Director.

 

(III) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(II)
of this  _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)(vi)_ to the contrary, in the event that the
number of Directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased
effective after the time period for which nominations would otherwise be due
under paragraph (A)(II) of this _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)(vi)_ and there is no
public announcement by the Partnership or the General Partner naming the
nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred (100)
days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, a
Limited Partner Groups notice required by this _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)(vi)_
shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the
additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the General Partner not
later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on
which such public announcement is first made by the Partnership or the
General Partner.

(B) Nominations of persons for election as a Director may be made at a
special meeting of Limited Partners at which Directors are to be elected
pursuant to the General Partners notice of meeting (I) by or at the direction
of a majority of the Directors or (II) provided that the Board of Directors
has determined that Directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any
Limited Partner Group pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.4(a)_ hereof, if each
member of such Limited Partner Group is a

 



82  Limited Partner at the time the notice provided for in this _Section_ __ _
13.4(b)(vi)_ is delivered to the General Partner and if the Limited Partner
Group complies with the notice procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _
13.4(b)(vi)_. In the event the General Partner calls a special meeting of
Limited Partners for the purpose of electing one or more Directors to the
Board of Directors, any such Limited Partner Group may nominate a person or
persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in
the General Partners notice of meeting, if the Limited Partner Groups notice
required by paragraph (A)(II) of this _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)(vi)_ shall be
delivered to the General Partner not earlier than the close of business on the
one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later
than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to
such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the
nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In
no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a
special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the
giving of a Limited Partner Groups notice as described above.

(C) (I) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)_ shall be eligible to be
elected at an annual or special meeting of Limited Partners to serve as
Directors. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman designated by the
General Partner pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.10_ shall have the power and
duty (a) to determine whether a nomination was made in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)_ (including whether the
members of the Limited Partner Group or beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the nomination is made solicited (or is part of a group which
solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of
such Limited Partner Groups nominee in compliance with such Limited Partner
Groups representation as required by clause (A)(II)(b)(vi) of this _Section_
__ _ 13.4(b)(vi)_) and (b) if any proposed nomination was not made
in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)_, to declare that such
nomination shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)_, unless otherwise required by law, if each
member of the Limited Partner Group (or a qualified representative of each
member of the Limited Partner Group) does not appear at the annual or special
meeting of Limited Partners to present a nomination, such nomination shall
be disregarded notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have
been received by the General Partner or the Partnership. For purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)_, to be considered a qualified representative of
a member of the Limited Partner Group, a person must be a duly authorized
officer, manager or partner of such Limited Partner or must be authorized by a
writing executed by such Limited Partner or an electronic transmission
delivered by such Limited Partner to act for such Limited Partner as proxy at
the meeting of Limited Partners and such person must produce such writing or
electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or
electronic transmission, at the meeting of Limited Partners.

 



83 (II) For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)(vi)_, " _public
announcement_ " shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the
Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or other national news service or in
a document publicly filed by the Partnership or the General Partner with the
Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

(III) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _
13.4(b)(vi)_, a Limited Partner shall also comply with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 13.4(b)(vi)_; provided however, that any references in this Agreement
to the Securities Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable
to nominations pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)(vi)_ (including
paragraphs A(I)(b) and B(II) hereof), and, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, compliance with paragraphs A(I)(b) and B(II) of this _Section_ __ _
13.4(b)(vi)_ shall be the exclusive means for a Limited Partner to make
nominations.

(vii) This  _Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)_ shall not be deemed in any way to
limit or impair the ability of the Board of Directors to adopt a " _poison
pill_ " or unitholder or other similar rights plan with respect to the
Partnership, whether such poison pill or plan contains " _dead hand_ "
provisions, " _no hand_ " provisions or other provisions relating to the
redemption of the poison pill or plan, in each case as such terms are used
under Delaware common law.

(viii) The Partnership and the General Partner shall use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to take such action as shall be necessary or
appropriate to give effect to and implement the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 13.4(b)_, including, without limitation, amending the organizational
documents of NuStar GP such that at all times the organizational documents of
NuStar GP shall provide (i) that the Directors shall be elected in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) terms consistent with this 
_Section_ __ _ 13.4(b)_.

(ix) If NuStar GP or the General Partner delegates to any Person the
management powers over the business and affairs of the Partnership provided to
the General Partner herein, the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _
13.4(b)_ shall be applicable with respect to the Board of Directors or other
governing body of such Person.

SECTION 13.5 _Notice of a Meeting._

 

Notice of a meeting called pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.4_ shall be given to
the Record Holders of the class or classes of Limited Partner Interests for
which a meeting is proposed in writing by mail or other means of written
communication in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 19.1_. The notice shall be
deemed to have been given at the time when deposited in the mail or sent by
other means of written communication.

 



84 SECTION 13.6 _Record Date._

 

For purposes of determining the Limited Partners entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to give approvals without a
meeting as provided in _Section_ __ _ 13.11_ the General Partner may set a
Record Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than 60 days before (a)
the date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts with any rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on
which the Limited Partner Interests are listed for trading, in which case the
rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such exchange shall govern)
or (b) in the event that approvals are sought without a meeting, the date by
which Limited Partners are requested in writing by the General Partner to give
such approvals.

 

SECTION 13.7 _Adjournment._

 

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given
of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need not be fixed, if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more than 45 days. At the
adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any business which might have
been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than
45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice
of the adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with this _Article
XIII_.

 

SECTION 13.8 _Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting; Approval of Minutes._

 

The transactions of any meeting of Limited Partners, however called and
noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a
meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either
in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, Limited
Partners representing such quorum who were present in person or by proxy and
entitled to vote, sign a written waiver of notice or an approval of the
holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All waivers and
approvals shall be filed with the Partnership records or made a part of the
minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Limited Partner
does not approve, at the beginning of the meeting, of the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and except
that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove the
consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting,
but not so included, if the disapproval is expressly made at the meeting. 

SECTION 13.9 _Quorum._

 

The holders of a majority of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of the
class, classes or series for which a meeting has been called represented in
person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Limited Partners
of such class, classes or series unless any such action by the Limited
Partners requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of such Limited
Partner Interests, in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage.
At any meeting of the Limited Partners duly called and held in accordance with
this Agreement at which a quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners
holding Outstanding Limited Partner Interests that in the aggregate represent
a majority of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests entitled to

 



85  vote and be present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall be deemed to
constitute the act of all Limited Partners, unless a greater or different
percentage is required with respect to such action under the provisions of
this Agreement, in which case the act of the Limited Partners holding
Outstanding Limited Partner Interests that in the aggregate represent at least
such greater or different percentage shall be required. The Limited Partners
present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may
continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of enough Limited Partners to leave less than a quorum, if any
action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by the required percentage
of Outstanding Limited Partner Interests specified in this Agreement
(including Limited Partner Interests deemed owned by the General Partner). In
the absence of a quorum any meeting of Limited Partners may be adjourned from
time to time by the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Limited Partner Interests entitled to vote at such meeting
(including Limited Partner Interests deemed owned by the General Partner)
represented either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be
transacted, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 13.7_.

 

SECTION 13.10 _Conduct of a Meeting._

 

The General Partner shall have full power and authority concerning the manner
of conducting any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of
approvals in writing, including the determination of Persons entitled to vote,
the existence of a quorum, the satisfaction of the requirements of _Section_
__ _ 13.4_, the conduct of voting, the validity and effect of any proxies
and the determination of any controversies, votes or challenges arising in
connection with or during the meeting or voting. The General Partner shall
designate a Person to serve as chairman of any meeting and shall further
designate a Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be
kept with the records of the Partnership maintained by the General Partner.
The General Partner may make such other regulations consistent with applicable
law and this Agreement as it may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any
meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing,
including regulations in regard to the appointment of proxies, the appointment
and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the submission and
examination of proxies and other evidence of the right to vote, and the
revocation of approvals in writing.

 

SECTION 13.11 _Action Without a Meeting._

 

If authorized by the General Partner, any action that may be taken at a
meeting of the Limited Partners may be taken without a meeting if an approval
in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by Limited Partners
owning not less than the minimum percentage of the Outstanding Limited Partner
Interests (including Limited Partner Interests deemed owned by the General
Partner) that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all the Limited Partners were present and voted (unless such
provision conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any
National Securities Exchange on which the Limited Partner Interests are
listed for trading, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or
requirement of such exchange shall govern). Prompt notice of the taking of
action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited Partners who have not
approved in writing. The General Partner may specify that any written ballot
submitted to Limited Partners for the purpose of taking any action without a
meeting shall be returned to the Partnership within the time period, which
shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the General Partner. If a ballot
returned to the Partnership does not vote all of the Limited Partner Interests
held by the Limited Partners the

 



86  Partnership shall be deemed to have failed to receive a ballot for the
Limited Partner Interests that were not voted. If approval of the taking of
any action by the Limited Partners is solicited by any Person other than by
or on behalf of the General Partner, the written approvals shall have no force
and effect unless and until (a) they are deposited with the Partnership in
care of the General Partner, (b) approvals sufficient to take the action
proposed are dated as of a date not more than 90 days prior to the date
sufficient approvals are deposited with the Partnership and (c) an Opinion of
Counsel is delivered to the General Partner to the effect that the exercise
of such right and the action proposed to be taken with respect to any
particular matter (i) will not cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be
taking part in the management and control of the business and affairs of the
Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners limited liability, and
(ii) is otherwise permissible under the state statutes then governing the
rights, duties and liabilities of the Partnership and the Partners.

Units or to act with respect to matters as to which the holders of the

All references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken
by, the Outstanding Series B Preferred Units shall be deemed to be references
to the votes or acts of the Record Holders of such Outstanding Series B
Preferred Units.

 

(d) Only those Record Holders of the Series C Preferred Units on the Record

meeting of Limited Partners holding Series C Preferred Units or to act with
respect to matters as to which the holders of the Outstanding Series C
Preferred Units have the right to vote or to act. All references in this
Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken by, the Outstanding
Series C Preferred Units shall be deemed to be references to the votes or acts
of the Record Holders of such Outstanding Series C Preferred Units.

account by another Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or
clearing corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), in whose name such
Limited Partner Interests are registered, such other Person shall, in
exercising the voting rights in respect of such Limited Partner Interests on
any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides
otherwise, vote such Limited Partner Interests in favor of, and at the
direction of, the Person who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership

provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 13.12(e)_ (as well as all other provisions
of this Agreement) are subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.3_.

which shall be newly formed and shall have no assets, liabilities or
operations at the time of such Merger other than those it receives from the
Partnership or other

 



89  Group Member if (i) the General Partner has received an Opinion of Counsel
that the merger or conveyance, as the case may be, would not result in the
loss of the limited liability of any Limited Partner or any partner in the
Operating Partnership or cause the Partnership or Operating Partnership to be
treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as
an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not previously
treated as such), (ii) the sole purpose of such merger or conveyance is to
effect a mere change in the legal form of the Partnership into another limited
liability entity and (iii) the governing instruments of the new entity

not be deemed to result in a transfer or assignment of assets or liabilities
from one entity to another.

SECTION 15.1 _Right to Acquire Limited Partner Interests._

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (but subject to
_Section_ __ _ 15.1(d)_), if at any time not more than 20% of the total
Limited Partner Interests of any class then Outstanding is held by Persons
other than the General Partner and its Affiliates, the General Partner shall
then have the right, which right it may assign and transfer in whole or in
part to the Partnership or any Affiliate of the General Partner, exercisable
in its sole discretion, to purchase all, but not less than all, of such
Limited Partner Interests of such class then Outstanding held by
Persons other than the General Partner and its Affiliates, at the greater of
(x) the Current Market Price as of the date three days prior to the date that
the notice described in _Section_ __ _ 15.1(b)_ is mailed and (y)
the highest price paid by the General Partner or any of its Affiliates for
any such Limited Partner Interest of such class purchased during the 90-day
period preceding the date that the notice described in _Section_ __ _
15.1(b)_ is mailed. As used in this Agreement, (i) " _Current Market Price_ "
as of any date of any class of Limited Partner Interests listed or admitted to
trading on any National Securities Exchange means the average of the daily
Closing Prices (as hereinafter defined) per Limited Partner Interest of such
class for the 20 consecutive Trading Days (as hereinafter defined) immediately
prior to such date; (ii) " _Closing Price_ " for any day means the last sale
price on such day, regular way, or in case no such sale takes place on such
day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on such day, regular way,
in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting
system with respect to securities listed or admitted for trading on the
principal National Securities Exchange (other than the Nasdaq Stock Market) on
which such Limited Partner Interests of such class are listed or admitted to
trading or, if such Limited Partner Interests of such class are not listed or
admitted to trading on any National Securities Exchange (other than the Nasdaq
Stock Market), the last quoted price on such day or, if not so quoted, the
average of the high bid and low asked prices on such day in the over-the-
counter market, as reported by the Nasdaq Stock Market or such other system
then in use, or, if on any such day such Limited Partner Interests of such
class are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid
and asked prices on such day as furnished by a professional market maker
making a market in such Limited Partner Interests of such class selected by
the General Partner, or if on any such day no market maker is making a market
in such Limited Partner Interests of such class, the fair value of such
Limited Partner Interests on such day as determined reasonably and in good
faith by the General Partner; and (iii) " _Trading Day_ " means a day on
which the principal National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner
Interests of any class are listed or admitted to trading is open for the

which banking institutions in New York City generally are open.

 

(b) If the General Partner, any Affiliate of the General Partner or the
Partnership elects to exercise the right to purchase Limited Partner
Interests granted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 15.1(a)_, the General Partner
shall deliver to the Transfer Agent notice of such election to purchase (the "
_Notice of Election to Purchase_ ") and shall cause the Transfer Agent to
mail a copy of such Notice of Election to Purchase to the Record Holders of
Limited Partner Interests of such class (as of a Record Date selected by the
General Partner) at least 10, but not more than 60, 

 



91  days prior to the Purchase Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase shall
also be published for a period of at least three consecutive days in at least
two daily newspapers of general circulation printed in the English language
and published in the Borough of Manhattan, New York. The Notice of Election to
Purchase shall specify the Purchase Date and the price (determined in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 15.1(a)_) at which Limited Partner Interests
will be purchased and state that the General Partner, its Affiliate or the
Partnership, as the case may be, elects to purchase such Limited Partner
Interests, upon surrender of Certificates representing such Limited Partner
Interests in exchange for payment, at such office or offices of the Transfer
Agent as the Transfer Agent may specify, or as may be required by any National
Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests are listed or
admitted to trading. Any such Notice of Election to Purchase mailed to a
Record Holder of Limited Partner Interests at his address as reflected in the
records of the Transfer Agent shall be conclusively presumed to have been
given regardless of whether the owner receives such notice. On or prior to the
Purchase Date, the General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the
case may be, shall deposit with the Transfer Agent cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate purchase price of all of such Limited
Partner Interests to be purchased in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
15.1_. If the Notice of Election to Purchase shall have been duly given as
aforesaid at least 10 days prior to the Purchase Date, and if on or prior to
the Purchase Date the deposit described in the preceding sentence has been
made for the benefit of the holders of Limited Partner Interests subject to
purchase as provided herein, then from and after the Purchase Date,
notwithstanding that any Certificate shall not have been surrendered for
purchase, all rights of the holders of such Limited Partner Interests
(including any rights pursuant to _Articles IV_ , _V_ ,  _VI_ , and _XII_ )
shall thereupon cease, except the right to receive the purchase price
(determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 15.1(a)_) for Limited Partner
Interests therefor, without interest, upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of
the Certificates representing such Limited Partner Interests, and such Limited
Partner Interests shall thereupon be deemed to be transferred to the General
Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, on the record
books of the Transfer Agent and the Partnership, and the General Partner or
any Affiliate of the General Partner, or the Partnership, as the case may be,
shall be deemed to be the owner of all such Limited Partner Interests from and
after the Purchase Date and shall have all rights as the owner of such
Limited Partner Interests (including all rights as owner of such Limited
Partner Interests pursuant to _Articles IV_ , _V_ , _VI_ and _XII_ ).

 

(c) At any time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an
Outstanding Limited Partner Interest subject to purchase as provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 15.1_ may surrender his Certificate evidencing such Limited
Partner Interest to the Transfer Agent in exchange for payment of the amount
described in  _Section_ __ _ 15.1(a)_, therefor, without interest thereon.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Article XV_ to the contrary, the
repurchase right described in this _Article XV_ shall not apply to Preferred
Units.

 



92 ARTICLE XVI

 

SERIES A FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PERPETUAL PREFERRED
UNITS

SECTION 16.1 _Designation_ _s._ __

 

A series of Preferred Units designated as "8.50% Series A Fixed-to-Floating
Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units" is hereby designated and
created, and the preferences, rights, powers and duties of the holders of the
Series A Preferred Units are set forth herein, including this _Article XVI_.
Each Series A Preferred Unit shall be identical in all respects to every other
Series A Preferred Unit, except as to the respective dates from which the
Series A Liquidation Preference shall increase or from which Series A
Distributions may begin accruing, to the extent such dates may differ. The
Series A Preferred Units represent perpetual equity interests in
the Partnership and, except as set forth in _Sections 16.5_ and _16.11_ ,
shall not give rise to a claim by the Partnership or a Series A Holder for
redemption or the conversion thereof, as applicable, at a particular date. 

SECTION 16.2 _Series A Preferred Units_ _._

 

(a) The authorized number of Series A Preferred Units shall be unlimited.
Series A Preferred Units that are purchased or otherwise acquired by the
Partnership shall be cancelled.

(b) The Series A Preferred Units shall be represented by one or more
global Certificates registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee,
and no Series A Holder shall be entitled to receive a definitive Certificate
evidencing its Series A Preferred Units, unless otherwise required by law or
the Depositary gives notice of its intention to resign or is no longer
eligible to act as such with respect to the Series A Preferred Units and the
Partnership shall have not selected a substitute Depositary within
60 calendar days thereafter. So long as the Depositary shall have been
appointed and is serving with respect to the Series A Preferred Units,
payments and communications made by the Partnership to Series A Holders shall
be made by making payments to, and communicating with, the Depositary.

SECTION 16.3 _Distributions_ _._

 

(a) Distributions on each Series A Preferred Unit shall be cumulative and
shall accumulate at the applicable Series A Distribution Rate from and
including the Series A Original Issue Date (or, for any subsequently issued
and newly Outstanding Series A Preferred Units, from and including the Series
A Distribution Payment Date immediately preceding the issue date of such
Series A Preferred Units) until such time as the Partnership pays the Series A
Distribution or redeems such Series A Preferred Unit in accordance with
_Section 16.5_ or such Series A Preferred Unit is converted in accordance
with _Section 16.11_ , whether or not such Series A Distributions shall have
been declared. Series A Holders shall be entitled to receive Series A
Distributions from time to time out of any assets of the Partnership legally
available for the payment of distributions at the Series A Distribution Rate
per Series A Preferred Unit when, as, and if declared by the General Partner.
Distributions, to the extent declared by the General Partner to be paid by
the Partnership in accordance with this _Section 16.3_ , shall be paid
quarterly on each Series A Distribution Payment Date. Distributions shall
accumulate in each Series A Distribution Period from and including the
preceding Series A Distribution Payment Date (other than the initial Series A
Distribution Period, which shall commence on and include the Series A Original
Issue Date), to but excluding the next Series A Distribution Payment Date for
such Series A Distribution Period; _provided_ that distributions shall accrue
on accumulated but unpaid Series A Distributions at the Series A Distribution
Rate. If any Series A Distribution Payment

 



93  Date otherwise would occur on a date that is not a Business Day, declared
Series A Distributions shall be paid on the immediately succeeding Business
Day without the accumulation of additional distributions. Series A
Distributions shall be payable based on a 360-day year consisting of four
90-day quarters. All Series A Distributions payable by the Partnership
pursuant to this _Section 16.3_ shall be payable without regard to income of
the Partnership and shall be treated for federal income tax purposes as
guaranteed payments for the use of capital under Section 707(c) of the Code.

(b) Not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Series A
Distribution Payment Date, the Partnership shall pay those Series A
Distributions, if any, that shall have been declared by the General Partner to
Series A Holders on the Record Date for the applicable Series A Distribution.
The Record Date (the " _Series_ __ _ A Distribution Record Date_") for the
payment of any Series A Distributions shall be as of the close of business on
the first Business Day of the month of the applicable Series A Distribution
Payment Date, except that in the case of payments of Series A Distributions in
Arrears, the Series A Distribution Record Date with respect to a Series A
Distribution Payment Date shall be such date as may be designated by the
General Partner in accordance with this _Article XVI_. So long as any Series
A Preferred Units are Outstanding, no distribution shall be declared or paid
or set aside for payment on any Junior Securities (other than a distribution
payable solely in Junior Securities) unless full cumulative Series A
Distributions have been or contemporaneously are being paid or set aside for
payment on all Outstanding Series A Preferred Units (and distributions on any
other Parity Securities) through the most recent respective Series A
Distribution Payment Date (and distribution payment date with respect to such
Parity Securities, if any). Accumulated Series A Distributions in Arrears for
any past Series A Distribution Period may be declared by the General Partner
and paid on any date fixed by the General Partner, whether or not a Series A
Distribution Payment Date, to Series A Holders on the Record Date for such
payment, which may not be less than 10 days before such payment date. Subject
to the next succeeding sentence, if all accumulated Series A Distributions in
Arrears on all Outstanding Series A Preferred Units and any other
Parity Securities shall not have been declared and paid, or if sufficient
funds for the payment thereof shall not have been set aside, payment of
accumulated distributions in Arrears on the Series A Preferred Units and any
such Parity Securities shall be made in order of their respective
distribution payment dates, commencing with the earliest. If less than all
distributions payable with respect to all Series A Preferred Units and any
other Parity Securities are paid, any partial payment shall be made Pro Rata
with respect to the Series A Preferred Units and any such other Parity
Securities entitled to a distribution payment at such time in proportion to
the aggregate distribution amounts remaining due in respect of such Series A
Preferred Units and such other Parity Securities at such time. Subject to
_Sections_ __ _ 12.4_ and _ 16.5_, Series A Holders shall not be entitled to
any distribution, whether payable in cash, property or Partnership
Securities, in excess of full cumulative Series A Distributions. Except
insofar as distributions accrue on the amount of any accumulated and unpaid
Series A Distributions as described in _Section 16.3(a)_ , no interest or
sum of money in lieu of interest shall be payable in respect of any
distribution payment which may be in Arrears on the Series A Preferred Units.
So long as the Series A Preferred Units are held of record by the
Depositary or its nominee, declared Series A Distributions shall be paid to
the Depositary in same-day funds on each Series A Distribution Payment Date or
other distribution payment date in the case of payments for Series A
Distributions in Arrears.

 



94 (c) The " _Series A Three-Month LIBOR_ " for each Series A Distribution
Period during the Series A Floating Rate Period shall be determined by the
Calculation Agent, as of the applicable Series A LIBOR Determination Date, in
accordance with the following provisions:

 

(i) The Series A Three-Month LIBOR shall be the rate (expressed as a
percentage per year) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period
commencing on the first day of such Series A Distribution Period that appears
on Reuters Page LIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the Series A LIBOR
Determination Date.

 

(ii) If the Series A Three-Month LIBOR cannot be determined as described
in  _Section_ __ _ 16.3(c)(i)_, the Partnership shall select four major
banks in the London interbank market and request that the principal London
offices of those four selected banks provide their offered quotations for
deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the
first day of the applicable Series A Distribution Period, to prime banks in
the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the
Series A LIBOR Determination Date for such Series A Distribution Period.
Offered quotations must be based on a principal amount equal to an amount
that, in the Partnerships judgment, is representative of a single transaction
in U.S. dollars in the London interbank market at the time. If two or more
quotations are provided, the Series A Three-Month LIBOR for such Series A
Distribution Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer
than two quotations are provided, the Series A Three-Month LIBOR for
such Series A Distribution Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates
quoted on the Series A LIBOR Determination Date for such Series A Distribution
Period by three major banks in New York City selected by the Partnership, for
loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period
commencing on the first day of such Series A Distribution Period. The rates
quoted must be based on an amount that, in the Partnerships judgment, is
representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at the
time. If fewer than three New York City banks selected by the Partnership are
quoting rates in the manner described above, the Series A Three-Month LIBOR
for the applicable Series A Distribution Period will be the same as for the
immediately preceding Series A Distribution Period or, if the immediately
preceding Series A Distribution Period was within the Series A Fixed Rate
Period, the same as for the most recent quarter for which the Series A Three-
Month LIBOR can be determined;

(iii) All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will
be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a
percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded
upwards and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations
will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded
upwards).

 

SECTION 16.4 _Voting Rights_ _._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Series
A Preferred Units shall not have any voting rights except as set forth in
_Section 13.3(c)_ , this _Section 16.4_ or as otherwise required by the
Delaware Act.

 



95 (b) Without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least
66 2/3% of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units, voting as a separate
class, the General Partner shall not adopt any amendment to this Agreement
that would have a material adverse effect on the powers, preferences, duties
or special rights of the Series A Preferred Units; _provided, however_ , that
(i) subject to _Section_ __ _ 16.4(c)_, the issuance of additional
Partnership Securities shall not be deemed to constitute such a material
adverse effect for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 16.4(b)_ and (ii) for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 16.4(b)_, no amendment of this Agreement in
connection with a merger or other transaction in which the Partnership is
the surviving entity and the Series A Preferred Units remain Outstanding with
the terms thereof materially unchanged in any respect adverse to the Series A
Holders shall be deemed to materially and adversely affect the powers,
preferences, duties or special rights of the Series A Preferred Units.

(c) Without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units voting as a class together
with holders of any other Parity Securities upon which like voting rights have
been conferred and are exercisable, the Partnership shall not (x) create or
issue any Parity Securities if the cumulative distributions payable on Series
A Preferred Units or any Parity Securities are in Arrears or (y) create or
issue any Senior Securities.

 

(d) For any matter described in this _Section 16.4_ in which the Series
A Holders are entitled to vote as a class (whether separately or together
with the holders of any Parity Securities), such Series A Holders shall be
entitled to one vote per Series A Preferred Unit. Any Series A Preferred Units
held by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries or their controlled
Affiliates shall not be entitled to vote.

 

(e) Notwithstanding _Sections 16.4(b)_ and _16.4(c)_ , no vote of the
Series A Holders shall be required if, at or prior to the time when such
action is to take effect, provision is made for the redemption of all Series A
Preferred Units at the time Outstanding.

 

SECTION 16.5 _Optional Redemption_ _; Series A Rating Event_

 

(a) The Partnership shall have the right (i) at any time, and from time to
time, on or after December 15, 2021 or (ii) at any time within 120 days after
the conclusion of any review or appeal process instituted by the Partnership
following the occurrence of a Series A Rating Event or (iii) at any time
within 120 days after the first date on which a Change of Control occurs, in
each case, to redeem the Series A Preferred Units, which redemption may be in
whole or in part (except with respect to a redemption pursuant to clause
_(ii)_ of this  _Section_ __ _ 16.5(a)_ which shall be in whole but not in
part), using any source of funds legally available for such purpose. Any such
redemption shall occur on a date set by the General Partner (the " _Series_
__ _ A Redemption Date_"). The Partnership shall effect any such redemption
by paying cash for each Series A Preferred Unit to be redeemed equal to the
Series A Liquidation Preference for such Series A Preferred Unit on such
Series A Redemption Date plus an amount equal to all unpaid distributions
thereon from the Series A Original Issue Date to, but not including, the
Series A Redemption Date (whether or not such distributions shall have been
declared) (the " _Series_ __ _ A Redemption Price_"); _provided_ that in
connection with a redemption in accordance with clause _(ii)_ of this 
_Section_ __ _ 16.5(a)_, the Series A Liquidation Preference per Series A
Preferred Unit shall be deemed to be equal to $25.50. So long as the Series A
Preferred Units to be redeemed are held of record by the nominee of
the Depositary, the Series A Redemption Price shall be paid by the Paying
Agent to the Depositary on the Series A Redemption Date.

 



96 (b) The Partnership shall give notice of any redemption by mail,
postage prepaid, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the
scheduled Series A Redemption Date to the Series A Holders (as of 5:00 p.m.
New York City time on the Business Day next preceding the day on which notice
is given) of any Series A Preferred Units to be redeemed as such Series A
Holders names appear on the books of the Transfer Agent and at the address of
such Series A Holders shown therein. Such notice (the " _Series_ __ _ A
Redemption Notice_") shall state, as applicable: (1) the Series A Redemption
Date, (2) the number of Series A Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if less
than all Outstanding Series A Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number
(and the identification) of Series A Preferred Units to be redeemed from such
Series A Holder, (3) the Series A Redemption Price, (4) the place where any
Series A Preferred Units in certificated form are to be redeemed and shall be
presented and surrendered for payment of the Series A Redemption Price
therefor and (5) that distributions on the Series A Preferred Units to be
redeemed shall cease to accumulate from and after such Series A Redemption
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership may give the Series A
Redemption Notice in advance of a Change of Control if a definitive agreement
is in place for the Change of Control at the time of giving the Series A
Redemption Notice.

(c) If the Partnership elects to redeem less than all of the Outstanding
Series A Preferred Units, the number of Series A Preferred Units to be
redeemed shall be determined by the General Partner, and such Series A
Preferred Units shall be redeemed by such method of selection as
the Depositary shall determine, either Pro Rata or by lot, with adjustments
to avoid redemption of fractional Series A Preferred Units. The aggregate
Series A Redemption Price for any such partial redemption of the Outstanding
Series A Preferred Units shall be allocated correspondingly among the
redeemed Series A Preferred Units. The Series A Preferred Units not redeemed
shall remain Outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences
provided in this _Article XVI_.

(d) If the Partnership gives or causes to be given a Series A
Redemption Notice, the Partnership shall deposit with the Paying Agent funds
sufficient to redeem the Series A Preferred Units as to which such Series A
Redemption Notice shall have been given, no later than 10:00 a.m. New York
City time on the Series A Redemption Date, and shall give the Paying Agent
irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Series A Redemption Price to
the Series A Holders whose Series A Preferred Units are to be redeemed upon
surrender or deemed surrender (which shall occur automatically if the
Certificate representing such Series A Preferred Units is issued in the name
of the Depositary or its nominee) of the Certificates therefor as set forth in
the Series A Redemption Notice. If the Series A Redemption Notice shall have
been given, from and after the Series A Redemption Date, unless the
Partnership defaults in providing funds sufficient for such redemption at the
time and place specified for payment pursuant to the Series A Redemption
Notice, all Series A Distributions on such Series A Preferred Units to be
redeemed shall cease to accumulate and all rights of holders of such Series A
Preferred Units as Limited Partners with respect to such Series A Preferred
Units to be redeemed shall cease, except the right to receive the Series A
Redemption Price, and such Series A Preferred Units shall not thereafter be
transferred on the books of the Transfer Agent or be deemed to be Outstanding
for any purpose whatsoever. The Series A Holders shall have no claim to the
interest income, if any,

 



97  earned on such funds deposited with the Paying Agent. Any funds deposited
with the Paying Agent hereunder by the Partnership for any reason, including
redemption of Series A Preferred Units, that remain unclaimed or unpaid after
two years after the applicable Series A Redemption Date or other payment date,
as applicable, shall be, to the extent permitted by law, repaid to the
Partnership upon its written request, after which repayment the Series A
Holders entitled to such redemption or other payment shall have recourse only
to the Partnership. Notwithstanding any Series A Redemption Notice, there
shall be no redemption of any Series A Preferred Units called for redemption
until funds sufficient to pay the full Series A Redemption Price of such
Series A Preferred Units shall have been deposited by the Partnership with the
Paying Agent.

 

(e) Any Series A Preferred Units that are redeemed or otherwise acquired by
the Partnership shall be cancelled. If only a portion of the Series A
Preferred Units represented by a Certificate shall have been called for
redemption, upon surrender of the Certificate to the Paying Agent (which shall
occur automatically if the Certificate representing such Series A Preferred
Units is registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee), the
Partnership shall issue and the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Series A
Holders a new Certificate (or adjust the applicable book-entry
account) representing the number of Series A Preferred Units represented by
the surrendered Certificate that have not been called for redemption.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article XVI_ , in
the event that full cumulative distributions on the Series A Preferred Units
and any Parity Securities shall not have been paid or declared and set aside
for payment, the Partnership shall not be permitted to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, in whole or in part, any Series A Preferred Units or
Parity Securities except pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the
same relative terms to all Series A Holders and holders of any Parity
Securities. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.9_, so long as any Series A
Preferred Units are Outstanding, the Partnership shall not be permitted to
redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any Common Units or any other Junior
Securities unless full cumulative distributions on the Series A Preferred
Units and any Parity Securities for all prior and the then-ending Series A
Distribution Periods shall have been paid or declared and set aside for
payment.

 

SECTION 16.6 _Rank_ _._ __ _ _

 

The Series A Preferred Units shall each be deemed to rank:

 

(a) senior to any Junior Securities;

 

(b) on a parity with any Parity Securities;

 

(c) junior to any Senior Securities; and

 

(d) junior to all existing and future indebtedness of the Partnership and
other liabilities with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against
the Partnership.

The Partnership may issue Junior Securities and, subject to any approvals
required pursuant to _Section 16.4(c)_ , _Section_ __ _ 17.4(c)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 18.4(c)_, Parity Securities from time to time in one or more
classes or series without the consent of the Series A Holders. Pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_, the General Partner has the authority to determine the
designations, preferences,

rights, powers and duties of any such class or series before the issuance of
any Partnership Interests of such class or series.

 



98 SECTION 16.7 _No Sinking Fund_ _._ __ _ _

 

The Series A Preferred Units shall not have the benefit of any sinking fund.

 

SECTION 16.8 _Record Holders_ _._ __ _ _

 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner, the
Partnership, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent may deem and treat any
Series A Holder as the true, lawful and absolute owner of the applicable
Series A Preferred Units for all purposes, and neither the General Partner,
the Partnership nor the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent shall be affected
by any notice to the contrary, except as otherwise provided by law or any
applicable rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National
Securities Exchange on which the Series A Preferred Units are listed or
admitted to trading.

 

SECTION 16.9 _Notices_ _._ __ _ _

 

All notices or communications in respect of the Series A Preferred Units shall
be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first
class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be
permitted in this _Article XVI_ , this Agreement or by applicable law.

 

SECTION 16.10 __ _ Other Rights; Fiduciary Duties_ _._ __ _ _

 

The Series A Preferred Units and the Series A Holders shall not have any
designations, preferences, rights, powers or duties, other than as set forth
in this Agreement or as provided by applicable law. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement or any duty existing at law, in equity or
otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, neither
the General Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall owe any duties or have any
liabilities to Series A Holders, other than the implied contractual covenant
of good faith and fair dealing.

 

SECTION 16.11 _Change of Control_ _._

 

(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control that occurs after the Series
A Original Issue Date, each Series A Holder shall have the right (" _Series_
__ _ A_ __ _ Change of Control Conversion Right_") to convert some or all of
the Series A Preferred Units held by such Series A Holder on the Series A
Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of Common Units per Series A
Preferred Unit that is an amount equal to the Series A Conversion Ratio (such
number of Common Units, the " _Series A_ _Common Unit
Conversion Consideration_ "), unless the Partnership provides notice of its
election to redeem Series A Preferred Units prior to the expiration of the
Partnerships redemption right contained in _Section 16.5(a)(iii)_. The "
_Series A_ _Change of Control Conversion Date_ " shall be the date fixed by
the General Partner, in its sole discretion, as the date the Series A
Preferred Units are entitled to be converted to Series A Conversion
Common Units as provided in this _Section 16.11_. Such Series A Change of
Control Conversion Date shall be a Business Day that is no fewer than 20 days
nor more than 35 days from the date on which the Partnership provides the
notice to Series A Holders of the Series A Change of Control Conversion Right
under _Section 16.11(b)_.

 



99 (b) No later than five days following the expiration of the Partnerships
redemption right contained in _ Section 16.5(a)(iii)_ or, if earlier waived,
the date of the Partnerships waiver of such right, the Partnership will
provide written notice to the Series A Holders that describes the Series A
Change of Control Conversion Right and states: (i) the events constituting the
Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control; (iii) the date on
which the Partnerships right to redeem the Outstanding Series A Preferred
Units pursuant to _Section 16.5(a)(iii)_ expired or was waived; (iv) the
Series A Change of Control Conversion Date; (v) the last date on which the
Series A Holders may exercise their Series A Change of Control Conversion
Right; (vi) the method and period for calculating the Common Unit Price with
respect to the Series A Preferred Units; (vii) if applicable, the type and
amount of Series A Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be
received per Series A Preferred Unit; (viii) the name and address of the
Paying Agent; and (ix) the procedures that the Series A Holders must follow to
exercise the Series A Change of Control Conversion Right.

(c) Subject to _Section 5.9_ , the " _Series_ __ _ A Conversion Ratio_"
shall be calculated as the lesser of: (i) the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) the Series A Liquidation Preference as of the Series A Change of Control
Conversion Date (unless the Series A Change of Control Conversion Date is
after a Series A Distribution Record Date and prior to the corresponding
Series A Distribution Payment Date, in which case any accumulated and unpaid
distribution will be excluded from this amount) by (y) the Common Unit
Price with respect to the Series A Preferred Units, and (ii) 1.0915 (the "
_Series A_ _Unit Cap_ "). The General Partner shall make such adjustments to
the Common Unit Price with respect to the Series A Preferred Units and
the Series A Unit Cap as it determines to be equitable in view of any splits,
combinations or distributions in the form of equity issuances or the payment
of any Series A Alternative Conversion Consideration to the holders of the
Common Units in connection with the Change of Control.

(d) In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Units
will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets
(including any combination thereof) (" _Series A_ _Alternative Conversion
Consideration_ "), each Series A Holder electing to exercise its Series A
Change of Control Conversion Right will receive upon conversion of the Series
A Preferred Units elected by such holder the kind and amount of such Series A
Alternative Conversion Consideration on a per Series A Preferred Unit basis
that such Series A Holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon
the Change of Control had such Series A Holder held a number of Common Units
equal to the Series A Common Unit Conversion Consideration immediately prior
to the effective time of the Change of Control; _ provided_, _ that_, if
the holders of Common Units have the opportunity to elect the form of
consideration to be received in such Change of Control, the consideration that
the Series A Holders electing to exercise their Series A Change of Control
Conversion Right will receive will be the form and proportion of the aggregate
consideration elected by the holders of Common Units who participate in the
determination (based on the weighted average of elections) and will be
subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Units are subject,
including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion
of the consideration payable in the Change of Control. No fractional Common
Units will be issued upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Units.
Instead, the Partnership shall pay the cash value of such fractional Common
Units.

 



100 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
prior to the expiration of the Partnerships redemption right contained in
_Section 16.5(a)(iii)_ , the Partnership provides notice of its election to
redeem Series A Preferred Units pursuant to _ Section 16.5_, Series
A Holders shall not have any right to convert the Series A Preferred Units
that the Partnership has elected to redeem, and any Series A Preferred Units
subsequently selected for redemption that have been tendered for conversion
shall be redeemed on the Series A Redemption Date instead of converted on the
Series A Change of Control Conversion Date.

 

(f) The Partnership shall issue a press release for publication through a
news or press organization as is reasonably expected to broadly disseminate
the relevant information to the public, or post notice on the website of the
Partnership, in any event prior to the opening of business on the first
Business Day following any date on which the Partnership (or a third party
with its prior written consent) provides the notice described in _Section
16.11(b)_ to the Series A Holders.

 

(g) Each Series A Holder electing to exercise its Series A Change of
Control Conversion Right will be required prior to the close of business on
the third Business Day preceding the Series A Change of Control Conversion
Date, to notify the Partnership of the number of Series A Preferred Units to
be converted pursuant to the Series A Change of Control Conversion Right and
otherwise to comply with any applicable procedures contained in the notice
described in _Section 16.11(b)_ or otherwise required by the Depositary for
effecting the conversion.

 

(h) Upon conversion, the rights of such participating Series A Holder as a
holder of the Series A Preferred Units shall cease with respect to such
converted Series A Preferred Units, and such Person shall continue to be a
Partner and have the rights of a holder of Common Units under this Agreement.
Each Series A Preferred Unit shall, upon its Series A Change of Control
Conversion Date, be deemed to be transferred to, and cancelled by, the
Partnership in exchange for the issuance of the Series A Conversion Common
Units.

 

(i) The Partnership shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or
transfer taxes or duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Series A
Conversion Common Units. However, the participating Series A Holder shall pay
any tax or duty that may be payable relating to any transfer involving the
issuance or delivery of Series A Conversion Common Units in a name other than
such Series A Holders name. The Transfer Agent may refuse to reflect the
notation of book entry (or the issuance of a Certificate) for Common Units
being issued in a name other than the Series A Holders name until the
Transfer Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax or duties that will be
due because the Common Units are to be issued in a name other than the Series
A Holders name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required
by law or regulation.

(j) The Partnership shall comply with all applicable securities laws
regulating the offer and delivery of any Series A Conversion Common Units
and, if the Common Units are then listed or quoted on a National Securities
Exchange or other market, shall list or cause to have quoted and keep listed
and quoted the Series A Conversion Common Units to the extent permitted or
required by the rules of such exchange or market.

 



101 (k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein
shall give to any Series A Holder any rights as a creditor in respect of its
right to conversion of Series A Preferred Units.

ARTICLE XVII 

SERIES B FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PERPETUAL

PREFERRED UNITS

 

SECTION 17.1 _Designation_ _s._ __

 

A series of Preferred Units designated as "7.625% Series B Fixed-to-Floating
Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units" is hereby designated and
created, and the preferences, rights, powers and duties of the holders of the
Series B Preferred Units are set forth herein, including this _Article XVII_.
Each Series B Preferred Unit shall be identical in all respects to every other
Series B Preferred Unit, except as to the respective dates from which the
Series B Liquidation Preference shall increase or from which Series B
Distributions may begin accruing, to the extent such dates may differ. The
Series B Preferred Units represent perpetual equity interests in the
Partnership and, except as set forth in _Sections 17.5_ and _17.11_ ,
shall not give rise to a claim by the Partnership or a Series B Holder for
redemption or the conversion thereof, as applicable, at a particular date.

 

SECTION 17.2 _Series B Preferred Units_ _._

 

(a) The authorized number of Series B Preferred Units shall be unlimited.
Series B Preferred Units that are purchased or otherwise acquired by the
Partnership shall be cancelled.

(b) The Series B Preferred Units shall be represented by one or more
global Certificates registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee,
and no Series B Holder shall be entitled to receive a definitive Certificate
evidencing its Series B Preferred Units, unless otherwise required by law or
the Depositary gives notice of its intention to resign or is no longer
eligible to act as such with respect to the Series B Preferred Units and the
Partnership shall have not selected a substitute Depositary within 60 calendar
days thereafter. So long as the Depositary shall have been appointed and is
serving with respect to the Series B Preferred Units, payments and
communications made by the Partnership to Series B Holders shall be made by
making payments to, and communicating with, the Depositary.

SECTION 17.3 _Distributions_ _._

 

(a) Distributions on each Series B Preferred Unit shall be cumulative and
shall accumulate at the applicable Series B Distribution Rate from and
including the Series B Original Issue Date (or, for any subsequently issued
and newly Outstanding Series B Preferred Units, from and including the Series
B Distribution Payment Date immediately preceding the issue date of such
Series B Preferred Units) until such time as the Partnership pays the Series B
Distribution or redeems such Series B Preferred Unit in accordance with
_Section 17.5_ or such

 



102  Series B Preferred Unit is converted in accordance with _Section 17.11_ ,
whether or not such Series B Distributions shall have been declared. Series B
Holders shall be entitled to receive Series B Distributions from time to time
out of any assets of the Partnership legally available for the payment of
distributions at the Series B Distribution Rate per Series B Preferred Unit
when, as, and if declared by the General Partner. Distributions, to the
extent declared by the General Partner to be paid by the Partnership in
accordance with this _Section 17.3_ , shall be paid quarterly on each Series
B Distribution Payment Date. Distributions shall accumulate in each Series B
Distribution Period from and including the preceding Series B Distribution
Payment Date (other than the initial Series B Distribution Period, which shall
commence on and include the Series B Original Issue Date), to but excluding
the next Series B Distribution Payment Date for such Series B Distribution
Period; _provided_ that distributions shall accrue on accumulated but unpaid
Series B Distributions at the Series B Distribution Rate. If any Series B
Distribution Payment Date otherwise would occur on a date that is not a
Business Day, declared Series B Distributions shall be paid on the immediately
succeeding Business Day without the accumulation of additional distributions.
Series B Distributions shall be payable based on a 360-day year consisting of
four 90-day quarters. All Series B Distributions payable by the Partnership
pursuant to this _Section 17.3_ shall be payable without regard to income
of the Partnership and shall be treated for federal income tax purposes as
guaranteed payments for the use of capital under Section 707(c) of the Code.

 

(b) Not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Series B
Distribution Payment Date, the Partnership shall pay those Series B
Distributions, if any, that shall have been declared by the General Partner to
Series B Holders on the Record Date for the applicable Series B Distribution.
The Record Date (the " _Series B Distribution Record Date_ ") for the payment
of any Series B Distributions shall be as of the close of business on the
first Business Day of the month of the applicable Series B Distribution
Payment Date, except that in the case of payments of Series B Distributions in
Arrears, the Series B Distribution Record Date with respect to a Series B
Distribution Payment Date shall be such date as may be designated by the
General Partner in accordance with this _Article XVII_. So long as any Series
B Preferred Units are Outstanding, no distribution shall be declared or paid
or set aside for payment on any Junior Securities (other than a distribution
payable solely in Junior Securities) unless full cumulative Series B
Distributions have been or contemporaneously are being paid or set aside for
payment on all Outstanding Series B Preferred Units (and distributions on any
other Parity Securities) through the most recent respective Series B
Distribution Payment Date (and distribution payment date with respect to such
Parity Securities, if any). Accumulated Series B Distributions in Arrears for
any past Series B Distribution Period may be declared by the General Partner
and paid on any date fixed by the General Partner, whether or not a Series B
Distribution Payment Date, to Series B Holders on the Record Date for such
payment, which may not be less than 10 days before such payment date. Subject
to the next succeeding sentence, if all accumulated Series B Distributions in
Arrears on all Outstanding Series B Preferred Units and any other Parity
Securities shall not have been declared and paid, or if sufficient funds for
the payment thereof shall not have been set aside, payment of accumulated
distributions in Arrears on the Series B Preferred Units and any such Parity
Securities shall be made in order of their respective distribution payment
dates, commencing with the earliest. If less than all distributions payable
with respect to all Series B Preferred Units and any other Parity Securities
are paid, any partial payment shall be made Pro Rata with respect to the
Series B Preferred Units and any such other Parity Securities entitled to a
distribution payment at such time in proportion to the aggregate 

 



103  distribution amounts remaining due in respect of such Series B Preferred
Units and such other Parity Securities at such time. Subject to  _Sections_
__ _ 12.4_ and _ 17.5_, Series B Holders shall not be entitled to any
distribution, whether payable in cash, property or Partnership Securities, in
excess of full cumulative Series B Distributions. Except insofar as
distributions accrue on the amount of any accumulated and unpaid Series B
Distributions as described in _Section 17.3(a)_ , no interest or sum of money
in lieu of interest shall be payable in respect of any distribution
payment which may be in Arrears on the Series B Preferred Units. So long as
the Series B Preferred Units are held of record by the Depositary or its
nominee, declared Series B Distributions shall be paid to the Depositary
in same-day funds on each Series B Distribution Payment Date or other
distribution payment date in the case of payments for Series B Distributions
in Arrears.

 

(c) The " _Series B Three-Month LIBOR_ " for each Series B Distribution
Period during the Series B Floating Rate Period shall be determined by the
Calculation Agent, as of the applicable Series B LIBOR Determination Date, in
accordance with the following provisions:

 

(i) The Series B Three-Month LIBOR shall be the rate (expressed as a
percentage per year) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period
commencing on the first day of such Series B Distribution Period that appears
on Reuters Page LIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the Series B LIBOR
Determination Date.

 

(ii) If the Series B Three-Month LIBOR cannot be determined as described
in  _Section_ __ _ 17.3(c)(i)_, the Partnership shall select four major
banks in the London interbank market and request that the principal London
offices of those four selected banks provide their offered quotations for
deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the
first day of the applicable Series B Distribution Period, to prime banks in
the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the
Series B LIBOR Determination Date for such Series B Distribution Period.
Offered quotations must be based on a principal amount equal to an amount
that, in the Partnerships judgment, is representative of a single transaction
in U.S. dollars in the London interbank market at the time. If two or more
quotations are provided, the Series B Three-Month LIBOR for such Series B
Distribution Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer
than two quotations are provided, the Series B Three-Month LIBOR for
such Series B Distribution Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates
quoted on the Series B LIBOR Determination Date for such Series B Distribution
Period by three major banks in New York City selected by the Partnership, for
loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period
commencing on the first day of such Series B Distribution Period. The rates
quoted must be based on an amount that, in the Partnerships judgment, is
representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at the
time. If fewer than three New York City banks selected by the Partnership are
quoting rates in the manner described above, the Series B Three-Month LIBOR
for the applicable Series B Distribution Period will be the same as for the
immediately preceding Series B Distribution Period or, if the immediately
preceding Series B Distribution Period was within the Series B Fixed Rate
Period, the same as for the most recent quarter for which the Series B Three-
Month LIBOR can be determined;

 



104 (iii) All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be
rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards and all
dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to
the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards).

 

SECTION 17.4 _Voting Rights_ _._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Series
B Preferred Units shall not have any voting rights except as set forth in
_Section 13.3(c)_ , this _Section 17.4_ or as otherwise required by the
Delaware Act.

 

(b) Without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the Outstanding Series B Preferred Units, voting as a separate class,
the General Partner shall not adopt any amendment to this Agreement that would
have a material adverse effect on the powers, preferences, duties or special
rights of the Series B Preferred Units; _provided, however_ , that (i)
subject to _Section_ __ _ 17.4(c)_, the issuance of additional Partnership
Securities shall not be deemed to constitute such a material adverse effect
for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 17.4(b)_ and (ii) for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 17.4(b)_, no amendment of this Agreement in connection with a
merger or other transaction in which the Partnership is the surviving
entity and the Series B Preferred Units remain Outstanding with the terms
thereof materially unchanged in any respect adverse to the Series B Holders
shall be deemed to materially and adversely affect the powers, preferences,
duties or special rights of the Series B Preferred Units.

(c) Without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the Outstanding Series B Preferred Units voting as a class together
with holders of any other Parity Securities upon which like voting rights have
been conferred and are exercisable, the Partnership shall not (x) create or
issue any Parity Securities if the cumulative distributions payable on Series
B Preferred Units or any Parity Securities are in Arrears or (y) create or
issue any Senior Securities.

 

(d) For any matter described in this _Section 17.4_ in which the Series
B Holders are entitled to vote as a class (whether separately or together
with the holders of any Parity Securities), such Series B Holders shall be
entitled to one vote per Series B Preferred Unit. Any Series B Preferred Units
held by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries or their controlled
Affiliates shall not be entitled to vote.

(e) Notwithstanding _Sections 17.4(b)_ and _17.4(c)_ , no vote of the
Series B Holders shall be required if, at or prior to the time when such
action is to take effect, provision is made for the redemption of all Series B
Preferred Units at the time Outstanding.

 

SECTION 17.5 _Optional Redemption_ _; Series B Rating Event_

 

(a) The Partnership shall have the right (i) at any time, and from time to
time, on or after June 15, 2022 or (ii) at any time within 120 days after the
conclusion of any review or appeal process instituted by the Partnership
following the occurrence of a Series B Rating Event or (iii) at any time
within 120 days after the first date on which a Change of Control occurs, in
each case, to redeem the Series B Preferred Units, which redemption may be in
whole or in part (except with respect to a redemption pursuant to clause
_(ii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 17.5(a)_ which shall be in whole but not in
part), using any source of funds legally available for such purpose. Any such

 



105  redemption shall occur on a date set by the General Partner (the " _Series B
Redemption Date_ "). The Partnership shall effect any such redemption by
paying cash for each Series B Preferred Unit to be redeemed equal to the
Series B Liquidation Preference for such Series B Preferred Unit on such
Series B Redemption Date plus an amount equal to all unpaid distributions
thereon from the Series B Original Issue Date to, but not including, the
Series B Redemption Date (whether or not such distributions shall have been
declared) (the " _Series B Redemption Price_ "); _provided_ that in connection
with a redemption in accordance with clause  _(ii)_ of this _Section_ __ _
17.5(a)_, the Series B Liquidation Preference per Series B Preferred Unit
shall be deemed to be equal to $25.50. So long as the Series B Preferred Units
to be redeemed are held of record by the nominee of the Depositary, the
Series B Redemption Price shall be paid by the Paying Agent to the Depositary
on the Series B Redemption Date.

 

(b) The Partnership shall give notice of any redemption by mail, postage
prepaid, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the scheduled
Series B Redemption Date to the Series B Holders (as of 5:00 p.m. New York
City time on the Business Day next preceding the day on which notice is given)
of any Series B Preferred Units to be redeemed as such Series B Holders
names appear on the books of the Transfer Agent and at the address of such
Series B Holders shown therein. Such notice (the " _Series B Redemption
Notice_ ") shall state, as applicable: (1) the Series B Redemption Date, (2)
the number of Series B Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if less than all
Outstanding Series B Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number (and the
identification) of Series B Preferred Units to be redeemed from such Series B
Holder, (3) the Series B Redemption Price, (4) the place where any Series B
Preferred Units in certificated form are to be redeemed and shall be presented
and surrendered for payment of the Series B Redemption Price therefor and (5)
that distributions on the Series B Preferred Units to be redeemed shall cease
to accumulate from and after such Series B Redemption Date. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Partnership may give the Series B Redemption Notice in advance
of a Change of Control if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of
Control at the time of giving the Series B Redemption Notice.

 

(c) If the Partnership elects to redeem less than all of the Outstanding
Series B Preferred Units, the number of Series B Preferred Units to be
redeemed shall be determined by the General Partner, and such Series B
Preferred Units shall be redeemed by such method of selection as the
Depositary shall determine, either Pro Rata or by lot, with adjustments
to avoid redemption of fractional Series B Preferred Units. The aggregate
Series B Redemption Price for any such partial redemption of the Outstanding
Series B Preferred Units shall be allocated correspondingly among the redeemed
Series B Preferred Units. The Series B Preferred Units not redeemed shall
remain Outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided in
this _ Article XVII_.

 

(d) If the Partnership gives or causes to be given a Series B Redemption
Notice, the Partnership shall deposit with the Paying Agent funds sufficient
to redeem the Series B Preferred Units as to which such Series B Redemption
Notice shall have been given, no later than 10:00 a.m. New York City time on
the Series B Redemption Date, and shall give the Paying Agent irrevocable
instructions and authority to pay the Series B Redemption Price to the Series
B Holders whose Series B Preferred Units are to be redeemed upon surrender or
deemed surrender (which shall occur automatically if the
Certificate representing such Series B Preferred Units is issued in the name
of the Depositary or its nominee) of the Certificates therefor as set

 



106  forth in the Series B Redemption Notice. If the Series B Redemption Notice
shall have been given, from and after the Series B Redemption Date, unless the
Partnership defaults in providing funds sufficient for such redemption at the
time and place specified for payment pursuant to the Series B Redemption
Notice, all Series B Distributions on such Series B Preferred Units to be
redeemed shall cease to accumulate and all rights of holders of such Series B
Preferred Units as Limited Partners with respect to such Series B Preferred
Units to be redeemed shall cease, except the right to receive the Series B
Redemption Price, and such Series B Preferred Units shall not thereafter
be transferred on the books of the Transfer Agent or be deemed to be
Outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. The Series B Holders shall have no
claim to the interest income, if any, earned on such funds deposited with the
Paying Agent. Any funds deposited with the Paying Agent hereunder by the
Partnership for any reason, including redemption of Series B Preferred Units,
that remain unclaimed or unpaid after two years after the applicable Series B
Redemption Date or other payment date, as applicable, shall be, to the extent
permitted by law, repaid to the Partnership upon its written request, after
which repayment the Series B Holders entitled to such redemption or other
payment shall have recourse only to the Partnership. Notwithstanding any
Series B Redemption Notice, there shall be no redemption of any Series B
Preferred Units called for redemption until funds sufficient to pay the full
Series B Redemption Price of such Series B Preferred Units shall have
been deposited by the Partnership with the Paying Agent.

(e) Any Series B Preferred Units that are redeemed or otherwise acquired
by the Partnership shall be cancelled. If only a portion of the Series B
Preferred Units represented by a Certificate shall have been called for
redemption, upon surrender of the Certificate to the Paying Agent (which shall
occur automatically if the Certificate representing such Series B Preferred
Units is registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee), the
Partnership shall issue and the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Series B
Holders a new Certificate (or adjust the applicable book-entry account)
representing the number of Series B Preferred Units represented by the
surrendered Certificate that have not been called for redemption.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article XVII_ , in
the event that full cumulative distributions on the Series B Preferred Units
and any Parity Securities shall not have been paid or declared and set aside
for payment, the Partnership shall not be permitted to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, in whole or in part, any Series B Preferred Units or
Parity Securities except pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the
same relative terms to all Series B Holders and holders of any Parity
Securities. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.9_, so long as any Series B
Preferred Units are Outstanding, the Partnership shall not be permitted to
redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any Common Units or any other Junior
Securities unless full cumulative distributions on the Series B Preferred
Units and any Parity Securities for all prior and the then-ending Series B
Distribution Periods shall have been paid or declared and set aside for
payment.

 

SECTION 17.6 _Rank_ _._ __ _ _

 

The Series B Preferred Units shall each be deemed to rank:

 

(a) senior to any Junior Securities;

 

(b) on a parity with any Parity Securities;

 



107 (c) junior to any Senior Securities; and

 

(d) junior to all existing and future indebtedness of the Partnership and
other liabilities with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against
the Partnership.

The Partnership may issue Junior Securities and, subject to any approvals
required pursuant to _Section 16.4(c)_ , _Section_ __ _ 17.4(c)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 18.4(c)_, Parity Securities from time to time in one or more
classes or series without the consent of the Series B Holders. Pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_, the General Partner has the authority to determine the
designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties of any such class or
series before the issuance of any Partnership Interests of such class or
series.

SECTION 17.7 _No Sinking Fund_ _._ __ _ _

 

The Series B Preferred Units shall not have the benefit of any sinking fund.

 

SECTION 17.8 _Record Holders_ _._ __ _ _

 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner, the
Partnership, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent may deem and treat any
Series B Holder as the true, lawful and absolute owner of the applicable
Series B Preferred Units for all purposes, and neither the General Partner,
the Partnership nor the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent shall be affected
by any notice to the contrary, except as otherwise provided by law or any
applicable rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National
Securities Exchange on which the Series B Preferred Units are listed or
admitted to trading.

 

SECTION 17.9 _Notices_ _._ __ _ _

 

All notices or communications in respect of the Series B Preferred Units shall
be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first
class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be
permitted in this _Article XVII_ , this Agreement or by applicable law.

 

SECTION 17.10 __ _ Other Rights; Fiduciary Duties_ _._ __ _ _

 

The Series B Preferred Units and the Series B Holders shall not have any
designations, preferences, rights, powers or duties, other than as set forth
in this Agreement or as provided by applicable law. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement or any duty existing at law, in equity or
otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, neither
the General Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall owe any duties or have any
liabilities to Series B Holders, other than the implied contractual covenant
of good faith and fair dealing.

 

SECTION 17.11 _Change of Control_ _._

 

(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control that occurs after the Series
B Original Issue Date, each Series B Holder shall have the right (" _Series
B_ __ _ Change of Control Conversion Right_") to convert some or all of the
Series B Preferred Units held by such Series B

 



108  Holder on the Series B Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of
Common Units per Series B Preferred Unit that is an amount equal to the Series
B Conversion Ratio (such number of Common Units, the " _Series B Common Unit
Conversion Consideration_ "), unless the Partnership provides notice of its
election to redeem Series B Preferred Units prior to the expiration of the
Partnerships redemption right contained in _Section 17.5(a)(iii)_. The "
_Series B Change of Control Conversion Date_ " shall be the date fixed by the
General Partner, in its sole discretion, as the date the Series B Preferred
Units are entitled to be converted to Series B Conversion Common Units as
provided in this _Section 17.11_. Such Series B Change of Control Conversion
Date shall be a Business Day that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35
days from the date on which the Partnership provides the notice to Series B
Holders of the Series B Change of Control Conversion Right under _Section
17.11(b)_.

 

(b) No later than five days following the expiration of the Partnerships
redemption right contained in _Section 17.5(a)(iii)_ or, if earlier waived,
the date of the Partnerships waiver of such right, the Partnership will
provide written notice to the Series B Holders that describes the Series B
Change of Control Conversion Right and states: (i) the events constituting
the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control; (iii) the date
on which the Partnerships right to redeem the Outstanding Series B Preferred
Units pursuant to _Section 17.5(a)(iii)_ expired or was waived; (iv) the
Series B Change of Control Conversion Date; (v) the last date on which the
Series B Holders may exercise their Series B Change of Control Conversion
Right; (vi) the method and period for calculating the Common Unit Price with
respect to the Series B Preferred Units; (vii) if applicable, the type and
amount of Series B Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be
received per Series B Preferred Unit; (viii) the name and address of the
Paying Agent; and (ix) the procedures that the Series B Holders must follow to
exercise the Series B Change of Control Conversion Right.

 

(c) Subject to _Section 5.9_ , the " _Series B Conversion Ratio_ " shall
be calculated as the lesser of: (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
Series B Liquidation Preference as of the Series B Change of Control
Conversion Date (unless the Series B Change of Control Conversion Date is
after a Series B Distribution Record Date and prior to the corresponding
Series B Distribution Payment Date, in which case any accumulated and unpaid
distribution will be excluded from this amount) by (y) the Common Unit Price
with respect to the Series B Preferred Units, and (ii) 1.04297 (the " _Series
B_ _Unit Cap_ "). The General Partner shall make such adjustments to the
Common Unit Price with respect to the Series B Preferred Units and the Series
B Unit Cap as it determines to be equitable in view of any splits,
combinations or distributions in the form of equity issuances or the payment
of any Series B Alternative Conversion Consideration to the holders of the
Common Units in connection with the Change of Control.

 

(d) In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Units will
be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any
combination thereof) (" _Series B_ _Alternative Conversion Consideration_ "),
each Series B Holder electing to exercise its Series B Change of Control
Conversion Right will receive upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Units
elected by such holder the kind and amount of such Series B Alternative
Conversion Consideration on a per Series B Preferred Unit basis that such
Series B Holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Change
of Control had such Series B Holder held a number of Common Units equal to the
Series B Common Unit Conversion

 



109  Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Change of
Control; _ provided_, _ that_, if the holders of Common Units have the
opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such Change
of Control, the consideration that the Series B Holders electing to exercise
their Series B Change of Control Conversion Right will receive will be the
form and proportion of the aggregate consideration elected by the holders of
Common Units who participate in the determination (based on the weighted
average of elections) and will be subject to any limitations to which all
holders of Common Units are subject, including, without limitation, pro
rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in the
Change of Control. No fractional Common Units will be issued upon the
conversion of the Series B Preferred Units. Instead, the Partnership shall pay
the cash value of such fractional Common Units.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior to
the expiration of the Partnerships redemption right contained in _Section
17.5(a)(iii)_ , the Partnership provides notice of its election to redeem
Series B Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 17.5_ , Series B Holders shall
not have any right to convert the Series B Preferred Units that the
Partnership has elected to redeem, and any Series B Preferred Units
subsequently selected for redemption that have been tendered for conversion
shall be redeemed on the Series B Redemption Date instead of converted on the
Series B Change of Control Conversion Date.

(f) The Partnership shall issue a press release for publication through a
news or press organization as is reasonably expected to broadly disseminate
the relevant information to the public, or post notice on the website of the
Partnership, in any event prior to the opening of business on the first
Business Day following any date on which the Partnership (or a third party
with its prior written consent) provides the notice described in _Section
17.11(b)_ to the Series B Holders.

 

(g) Each Series B Holder electing to exercise its Series B Change of
Control Conversion Right will be required prior to the close of business on
the third Business Day preceding the Series B Change of Control Conversion
Date, to notify the Partnership of the number of Series B Preferred Units to
be converted pursuant to the Series B Change of Control Conversion Right and
otherwise to comply with any applicable procedures contained in the notice
described in _Section 17.11(b)_ or otherwise required by the Depositary for
effecting the conversion.

 

(h) Upon conversion, the rights of such participating Series B Holder as a
holder of the Series B Preferred Units shall cease with respect to such
converted Series B Preferred Units, and such Person shall continue to be a
Partner and have the rights of a holder of Common Units under this Agreement.
Each Series B Preferred Unit shall, upon its Series B Change of Control
Conversion Date, be deemed to be transferred to, and cancelled by, the
Partnership in exchange for the issuance of the Series B Conversion Common
Units.

 

(i) The Partnership shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or
transfer taxes or duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Series B
Conversion Common Units. However, the participating Series B Holder shall pay
any tax or duty that may be payable relating to any transfer involving the
issuance or delivery of Series B Conversion Common Units in a name other than
such Series B Holders name. The Transfer Agent may refuse to reflect the

 



110  notation of book entry (or the issuance of a Certificate) for Common Units
being issued in a name other than the Series B Holders name until the
Transfer Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax or duties that will
be due because the Common Units are to be issued in a name other than the
Series B Holders name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding
required by law or regulation.

 

(j) The Partnership shall comply with all applicable securities laws
regulating the offer and delivery of any Series B Conversion Common Units
and, if the Common Units are then listed or quoted on a National Securities
Exchange or other market, shall list or cause to have quoted and keep listed
and quoted the Series B Conversion Common Units to the extent permitted or
required by the rules of such exchange or market.

(k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall
give to any Series B Holder any rights as a creditor in respect of its right
to conversion of Series B Preferred Units.

 

ARTICLE XVIII

SERIES C FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PERPETUAL

PREFERRED UNITS

SECTION 18.1 _Designations._ __

 

A series of Preferred Units designated as "9.00% Series C Fixed-to-Floating
Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units" is hereby designated and
created, and the preferences, rights, powers and duties of the holders of the
Series C Preferred Units are set forth herein, including this _Article
XVIII_. Each Series C Preferred Unit shall be identical in all respects to
every other Series C Preferred Unit, except as to the respective dates
from which the Series C Liquidation Preference shall increase or from which
Series C Distributions may begin accruing, to the extent such dates may
differ. The Series C Preferred Units represent perpetual equity interests in
the Partnership and, except as set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 18.5_ and
_18.11_ , shall not give rise to a claim by the Partnership or a Series C
Holder for redemption or the conversion thereof, as applicable, at a
particular date.

 

SECTION 18.2 _Series C Preferred Units._

 

(a) The authorized number of Series C Preferred Units shall be unlimited.
Series C Preferred Units that are purchased or otherwise acquired by the
Partnership shall be cancelled.

(b) The Series C Preferred Units shall be represented by one or more
global Certificates registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee,
and no Series C Holder shall be entitled to receive a definitive Certificate
evidencing its Series C Preferred Units, unless otherwise required by law or
the Depositary gives notice of its intention to resign or is no longer
eligible to act as such with respect to the Series C Preferred Units and the
Partnership shall have not selected a substitute Depositary within 60 calendar
days thereafter. So long as the Depositary shall have been appointed and is
serving with respect to the Series C Preferred Units, payments and
communications made by the Partnership to Series C Holders shall be made by
making payments to, and communicating with, the Depositary.

 



111 SECTION 18.3 _Distributions._

 

(a) Distributions on each Series C Preferred Unit shall be cumulative and
shall accumulate at the applicable Series C Distribution Rate from and
including the Series C Original Issue Date (or, for any subsequently issued
and newly Outstanding Series C Preferred Units, from and including the Series
C Distribution Payment Date immediately preceding the issue date of such
Series C Preferred Units) until such time as the Partnership pays the Series C
Distribution or redeems such Series C Preferred Unit in accordance with
_Section 18.5_ or such Series C Preferred Unit is converted in
accordance with _Section 18.11_ , whether or not such Series C Distributions
shall have been declared. Series C Holders shall be entitled to receive Series
C Distributions from time to time out of any assets of the Partnership legally
available for the payment of distributions at the Series C Distribution Rate
per Series C Preferred Unit when, as, and if declared by the General Partner.
Distributions, to the extent declared by the General Partner to be paid by the
Partnership in accordance with this _Section 18.3_ , shall be paid quarterly
on each Series C Distribution Payment Date. Distributions shall accumulate in
each Series C Distribution Period from and including the preceding Series C
Distribution Payment Date (other than the initial Series C Distribution
Period, which shall commence on and include the Series C Original Issue Date),
to but excluding the next Series C Distribution Payment Date for such Series C
Distribution Period; _provided_ that distributions shall accrue on
accumulated but unpaid Series C Distributions at the Series C Distribution
Rate. If any Series C Distribution Payment Date otherwise would occur on a
date that is not a Business Day, declared Series C Distributions shall be
paid on the immediately succeeding Business Day without the accumulation of
additional distributions. Series C Distributions shall be payable based on a
360-day year consisting of four 90-day quarters. All Series C Distributions
payable by the Partnership pursuant to this _Section 18.3_ shall be payable
without regard to income of the Partnership and shall be treated for federal
income tax purposes as guaranteed payments for the use of capital under
Section 707(c) of the Code.

 

(b) Not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Series C
Distribution Payment Date, the Partnership shall pay those Series C
Distributions, if any, that shall have been declared by the General Partner to
Series C Holders on the Record Date for the applicable Series C Distribution.
The Record Date (the " _Series C Distribution Record Date_ ") for the payment
of any Series C Distributions shall be as of the close of business on the
first Business Day of the month of the applicable Series C Distribution
Payment Date, except that in the case of payments of Series C Distributions in
Arrears, the Series C Distribution Record Date with respect to a Series C
Distribution Payment Date shall be such date as may be designated by the
General Partner in accordance with this _Article XVIII_. So long as any
Series C Preferred Units are Outstanding, no distribution shall be declared
or paid or set aside for payment on any Junior Securities (other than a
distribution payable solely in Junior Securities) unless full cumulative
Series C Distributions have been or contemporaneously are being paid or set
aside for payment on all Outstanding Series C Preferred Units (and
distributions on any other Parity Securities) through the most recent
respective Series C Distribution Payment Date (and distribution payment date
with respect to such Parity Securities, if any). Accumulated Series C
Distributions in Arrears for any past Series C Distribution Period may be
declared by the General Partner and paid on any date fixed by the General
Partner, whether or not a Series C Distribution Payment Date, to Series C
Holders on the Record Date for such payment, which may not be less than 10
days before such payment date. Subject to the next succeeding sentence, if all
accumulated

 



112  Series C Distributions in Arrears on all Outstanding Series C Preferred
Units and any other Parity Securities shall not have been declared and paid,
or if sufficient funds for the payment thereof shall not have been set aside,
payment of accumulated distributions in Arrears on the Series C Preferred
Units and any such Parity Securities shall be made in order of their
respective distribution payment dates, commencing with the earliest. If less
than all distributions payable with respect to all Series C Preferred Units
and any other Parity Securities are paid, any partial payment shall be made
Pro Rata with respect to the Series C Preferred Units and any such other
Parity Securities entitled to a distribution payment at such time in
proportion to the aggregate distribution amounts remaining due in respect of
such Series C Preferred Units and such other Parity Securities at such time.
Subject to  _Sections_ __ _ 12.4_ and _18.5_ , Series C Holders shall not
be entitled to any distribution, whether payable in cash, property or
Partnership Securities, in excess of full cumulative Series C Distributions.
Except insofar as distributions accrue on the amount of any accumulated and
unpaid Series C Distributions as described in _Section 18.3(a)_ , no interest
or sum of money in lieu of interest shall be payable in respect of any
distribution payment which may be in Arrears on the Series C Preferred Units.
So long as the Series C Preferred Units are held of record by the Depositary
or its nominee, declared Series C Distributions shall be paid to the
Depositary in same-day funds on each Series C Distribution Payment Date or
other distribution payment date in the case of payments for Series C
Distributions in Arrears.

 

(c) The " _Series C Three-Month LIBOR_ " for each Series C Distribution
Period during the Series C Floating Rate Period shall be determined by the
Calculation Agent, as of the applicable Series C LIBOR Determination Date, in
accordance with the following provisions:

 

(i) The Series C Three-Month LIBOR shall be the rate (expressed as a
percentage per year) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period
commencing on the first day of such Series C Distribution Period that appears
on Reuters Page LIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the Series C LIBOR
Determination Date.

 

(ii) If the Series C Three-Month LIBOR cannot be determined as described
in  _Section_ __ _ 18.3(c)(i)_, the Partnership shall select four major
banks in the London interbank market and request that the principal London
offices of those four selected banks provide their offered quotations for
deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the
first day of the applicable Series C Distribution Period, to prime banks in
the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the
Series C LIBOR Determination Date for such Series C Distribution Period.
Offered quotations must be based on a principal amount equal to an amount
that, in the Partnerships judgment, is representative of a single transaction
in U.S. dollars in the London interbank market at the time. If two or more
quotations are provided, the Series C Three-Month LIBOR for such Series C
Distribution Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer
than two quotations are provided, the Series C Three-Month LIBOR for
such Series C Distribution Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates
quoted on the Series C LIBOR Determination Date for such Series C Distribution
Period by three major banks in New York City selected by the Partnership, for
loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period
commencing on the first day of such Series C Distribution Period. The rates
quoted must be based on an amount that, in the Partnerships judgment, is
representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at the
time. If fewer than three New York City banks selected by the

 



113  Partnership are quoting rates in the manner described above, the Series C
Three-Month LIBOR for the applicable Series C Distribution Period will be the
same as for the immediately preceding Series C Distribution Period or, if the
immediately preceding Series C Distribution Period was within the Series C
Fixed Rate Period, the same as for the most recent quarter for which the
Series C Three-Month LIBOR can be determined. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Calculation Agent determines on the applicable Series C LIBOR
Determination Date that the Series C Three-Month LIBOR has been discontinued,
then the Calculation Agent will use a substitute or successor base rate that
it has determined in its sole discretion is most comparable to the Series C
Three-Month LIBOR, provided that if the Calculation Agent determines there is
an industry-accepted substitute or successor base rate, then the Calculation
Agent shall use such substitute or successor base rate; and if the
Calculation Agent has determined a substitute or successor base rate in
accordance with the foregoing, the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion
may determine what business day convention to use, the definition of business
day, the distribution determination date to be used and any other relevant
methodology for calculating such substitute or successor base rate, including
any adjustment factor needed to make such substitute or successor base rate
comparable to the Series C Three-Month LIBOR, in a manner that is consistent
with industry-accepted practices for such substitute or successor base rate.

 

(iii) All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be
rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards and all
dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to
the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards).

SECTION 18.4 _Voting Rights._

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Series
C Preferred Units shall not have any voting rights except as set forth in
_Section 13.3(c)_ , this _Section 18.4_ or as otherwise required by the
Delaware Act.

 

(b) Without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the Outstanding Series C Preferred Units, voting as a separate class,
the General Partner shall not adopt any amendment to this Agreement that would
have a material adverse effect on the powers, preferences, duties or special
rights of the Series C Preferred Units; _provided, however_ , that (i)
subject to _Section_ __ _ 18.4(c)_, the issuance of additional Partnership
Securities shall not be deemed to constitute such a material adverse effect
for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 18.4(b)_ and (ii) for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 18.4(b)_, no amendment of this Agreement in connection with a
merger or other transaction in which the Partnership is the surviving
entity and the Series C Preferred Units remain Outstanding with the terms
thereof materially unchanged in any respect adverse to the Series C Holders
shall be deemed to materially and adversely affect the powers, preferences,
duties or special rights of the Series C Preferred Units.

(c) Without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the Outstanding Series C Preferred Units voting as a class together
with holders of any other Parity Securities upon which like voting rights have
been conferred and are exercisable, the

 



114  Partnership shall not (x) create or issue any Parity Securities if the
cumulative distributions payable on Series C Preferred Units or any Parity
Securities are in Arrears or (y) create or issue any Senior Securities.

(d) For any matter described in this _Section 18.4_ in which the Series
C Holders are entitled to vote as a class (whether separately or together with
the holders of any Parity Securities), such Series C Holders shall be entitled
to one vote per Series C Preferred Unit. Any Series C Preferred Units held by
the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries or their controlled Affiliates
shall not be entitled to vote.

 

(e) Notwithstanding _Sections 18.4(b)_ and _18.4(c)_ , no vote of the
Series C Holders shall be required if, at or prior to the time when such
action is to take effect, provision is made for the redemption of all Series C
Preferred Units at the time Outstanding.

 

SECTION 18.5 _Optional Redemption_ _; Series C Rating Event_

 

(a) The Partnership shall have the right (i) at any time, and from time to
time, on or after December 15, 2022 or (ii) at any time within 120 days after
the conclusion of any review or appeal process instituted by the Partnership
following the occurrence of a Series C Rating Event or (iii) at any time
within 120 days after the first date on which a Change of Control occurs, in
each case, to redeem the Series C Preferred Units, which redemption may be in
whole or in part (except with respect to a redemption pursuant to clause
_(ii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 18.5(a)_ which shall be in whole but not in
part), using any source of funds legally available for such purpose. Any such
redemption shall occur on a date set by the General Partner (the " _Series C
Redemption Date_ "). The Partnership shall effect any such redemption by
paying cash for each Series C Preferred Unit to be redeemed equal to the
Series C Liquidation Preference for such Series C Preferred Unit on such
Series C Redemption Date plus an amount equal to all unpaid distributions
thereon from the Series C Original Issue Date to, but not including, the
Series C Redemption Date (whether or not such distributions shall have been
declared) (the " _Series C Redemption Price_ "); _provided_  that in
connection with a redemption in accordance with clause _(ii)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 18.5(a)_, the Series C Liquidation Preference per Series C
Preferred Unit shall be deemed to be equal to $25.50. So long as the Series C
Preferred Units to be redeemed are held of record by the nominee of the
Depositary, the Series C Redemption Price shall be paid by the Paying Agent to
the Depositary on the Series C Redemption Date.

 

(b) The Partnership shall give notice of any redemption by mail, postage
prepaid, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the scheduled
Series C Redemption Date to the Series C Holders (as of 5:00 p.m. New York
City time on the Business Day next preceding the day on which notice is given)
of any Series C Preferred Units to be redeemed as such Series C Holders
names appear on the books of the Transfer Agent and at the address of such
Series C Holders shown therein. Such notice (the " _Series C Redemption
Notice_ ") shall state, as applicable: (1) the Series C Redemption Date, (2)
the number of Series C Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if less than all
Outstanding Series C Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number (and the
identification) of Series C Preferred Units to be redeemed from such Series C
Holder, (3) the Series C Redemption Price, (4) the place where any Series C
Preferred Units in certificated form are to be redeemed and shall be presented
and surrendered for payment of the Series C Redemption Price therefor and (5)
that distributions on the Series C Preferred Units to be

 



115  redeemed shall cease to accumulate from and after such Series C Redemption
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership may give the Series C
Redemption Notice in advance of a Change of Control if a definitive agreement
is in place for the Change of Control at the time of giving the Series C
Redemption Notice.

 

(c) If the Partnership elects to redeem less than all of the Outstanding
Series C Preferred Units, the number of Series C Preferred Units to be
redeemed shall be determined by the General Partner, and such Series C
Preferred Units shall be redeemed by such method of selection as the
Depositary shall determine, either Pro Rata or by lot, with adjustments to
avoid redemption of fractional Series C Preferred Units. The aggregate Series
C Redemption Price for any such partial redemption of the Outstanding Series C
Preferred Units shall be allocated correspondingly among the redeemed Series C
Preferred Units. The Series C Preferred Units not redeemed shall remain
Outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided in this
_Article XVIII_.

 

(d) If the Partnership gives or causes to be given a Series C Redemption
Notice, the Partnership shall deposit with the Paying Agent funds sufficient
to redeem the Series C Preferred Units as to which such Series C Redemption
Notice shall have been given, no later than 10:00 a.m. New York City time on
the Series C Redemption Date, and shall give the Paying Agent irrevocable
instructions and authority to pay the Series C Redemption Price to the Series
C Holders whose Series C Preferred Units are to be redeemed upon surrender or
deemed surrender (which shall occur automatically if the Certificate
representing such Series C Preferred Units is issued in the name of the
Depositary or its nominee) of the Certificates therefor as set forth in the
Series C Redemption Notice. If the Series C Redemption Notice shall have been
given, from and after the Series C Redemption Date, unless the Partnership
defaults in providing funds sufficient for such redemption at the time and
place specified for payment pursuant to the Series C Redemption Notice, all
Series C Distributions on such Series C Preferred Units to be redeemed shall
cease to accumulate and all rights of holders of such Series C Preferred Units
as Limited Partners with respect to such Series C Preferred Units to be
redeemed shall cease, except the right to receive the Series C Redemption
Price, and such Series C Preferred Units shall not thereafter be transferred
on the books of the Transfer Agent or be deemed to be Outstanding for any
purpose whatsoever. The Series C Holders shall have no claim to the interest
income, if any, earned on such funds deposited with the Paying Agent. Any
funds deposited with the Paying Agent hereunder by the Partnership for any
reason, including redemption of Series C Preferred Units, that remain
unclaimed or unpaid after two years after the applicable Series C Redemption
Date or other payment date, as applicable, shall be, to the extent permitted
by law, repaid to the Partnership upon its written request, after which
repayment the Series C Holders entitled to such redemption or other
payment shall have recourse only to the Partnership. Notwithstanding any
Series C Redemption Notice, there shall be no redemption of any Series C
Preferred Units called for redemption until funds sufficient to pay the full
Series C Redemption Price of such Series C Preferred Units shall have been
deposited by the Partnership with the Paying Agent.

(e) Any Series C Preferred Units that are redeemed or otherwise acquired
by the Partnership shall be cancelled. If only a portion of the Series C
Preferred Units represented by a Certificate shall have been called for
redemption, upon surrender of the Certificate to the Paying Agent (which
shall occur automatically if the Certificate representing such Series C
Preferred Units is registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee),
the Partnership shall issue and 

 



116  the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Series C Holders a new Certificate (or
adjust the applicable book-entry account) representing the number of Series C
Preferred Units represented by the surrendered Certificate that have not been
called for redemption.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article XVIII_ , in
the event that full cumulative distributions on the Series C Preferred Units
and any Parity Securities shall not have been paid or declared and set aside
for payment, the Partnership shall not be permitted to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, in whole or in part, any Series C Preferred Units or Parity
Securities except pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same
relative terms to all Series C Holders and holders of any Parity Securities.
Subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.9_, so long as any Series C Preferred Units are
Outstanding, the Partnership shall not be permitted to redeem, repurchase or
otherwise acquire any Common Units or any other Junior Securities unless full
cumulative distributions on the Series C Preferred Units and any Parity
Securities for all prior and the then-ending Series C Distribution Periods
shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment.

 

SECTION 18.6 _Rank._ __ _ _

 

The Series C Preferred Units shall each be deemed to rank:

 

(a) senior to any Junior Securities;

 

(b) on a parity with any Parity Securities;

 

(c) junior to any Senior Securities; and

 

(d) junior to all existing and future indebtedness of the Partnership and
other liabilities with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against
the Partnership.

The Partnership may issue Junior Securities and, subject to any approvals
required pursuant to _Section 16.4(c)_ , _Section_ __ _ 17.4(c)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 18.4(c)_, Parity Securities from time to time in one or more
classes or series without the consent of the Series C Holders. Pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_, the General Partner has the authority to determine the
designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties of any such class or
series before the issuance of any Partnership Interests of such class or
series.

SECTION 18.7 _No Sinking Fund._ __ _ _

 

The Series C Preferred Units shall not have the benefit of any sinking fund.

 

SECTION 18.8 _Record Holders._ __ _ _

 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner, the
Partnership, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent may deem and treat any
Series C Holder as the true, lawful and absolute owner of the applicable
Series C Preferred Units for all purposes, and neither the General Partner,
the Partnership nor the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent shall be affected
by any notice to the contrary, except as otherwise provided by law or any
applicable rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National
Securities Exchange on which the Series C Preferred Units are listed or
admitted to trading.

 



117 SECTION 18.9 _Notices._ __ _ _

 

All notices or communications in respect of the Series C Preferred Units shall
be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first
class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be
permitted in this _Article XVIII_ , this Agreement or by applicable law.

 

SECTION 18.10 __ _ Other Rights; Fiduciary Duties._ __ _ _

 

The Series C Preferred Units and the Series C Holders shall not have any
designations, preferences, rights, powers or duties, other than as set forth
in this Agreement or as provided by applicable law. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement or any duty existing at law, in equity or
otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, neither
the General Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall owe any duties or have any
liabilities to Series C Holders, other than the implied contractual covenant
of good faith and fair dealing.

 

SECTION 18.11 _Change of Control._

 

(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control that occurs after the Series
C Original Issue Date, each Series C Holder shall have the right (" _Series
C_ __ _ Change of Control Conversion Right_") to convert some or all of the
Series C Preferred Units held by such Series C Holder on the Series C Change
of Control Conversion Date into a number of Common Units per Series C
Preferred Unit that is an amount equal to the Series C Conversion Ratio (such
number of Common Units, the " _Series C_ _Common Unit Conversion
Consideration_ "), unless the Partnership provides notice of its election to
redeem Series C Preferred Units prior to the expiration of the Partnerships
redemption right contained in _Section 18.5(a)(iii)_. The " _Series C_
_Change of Control Conversion Date_ " shall be the date fixed by the General
Partner, in its sole discretion, as the date the Series C Preferred Units are
entitled to be converted to Series C Conversion Common Units as provided in
this _Section 18.11_. Such Series C Change of Control Conversion Date shall
be a Business Day that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days from the
date on which the Partnership provides the notice to Series C Holders of the
Series C Change of Control Conversion Right under _Section 18.11(b)_.

(b) No later than five days following the expiration of the
Partnerships redemption right contained in _Section 18.5(a)(iii)_ or, if
earlier waived, the date of the Partnerships waiver of such right, the
Partnership will provide written notice to the Series C Holders that describes
the Series C Change of Control Conversion Right and states: (i) the events
constituting the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control;
(iii) the date on which the Partnerships right to redeem the Outstanding
Series C Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 18.5(a)(iii)_ expired or was
waived; (iv) the Series C Change of Control Conversion Date; (v) the last date
on which the Series C Holders may exercise their Series C Change of
Control Conversion Right; (vi) the method and period for calculating the
Common Unit Price with respect to the Series C Preferred Units; (vii) if
applicable, the type and amount of Series C Alternative Conversion
Consideration entitled to be received per Series C Preferred Unit;

 



118  (viii) the name and address of the Paying Agent; and (ix) the procedures
that the Series C Holders must follow to exercise the Series C Change of
Control Conversion Right.

 

(c) Subject to _Section 5.9_ , the " _Series C Conversion Ratio_ " shall
be calculated as the lesser of: (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
Series C Liquidation Preference as of the Series C Change of Control
Conversion Date (unless the Series C Change of Control Conversion Date is
after a Series C Distribution Record Date and prior to the corresponding
Series C Distribution Payment Date, in which case any accumulated and unpaid
distribution will be excluded from this amount) by (y) the Common Unit Price
with respect to the Series C Preferred Units, and (ii) 1.7928 (the " _Series
C_ _Unit Cap_ "). The General Partner shall make such adjustments to the
Common Unit Price with respect to the Series C Preferred Units and the Series
C Unit Cap as it determines to be equitable in view of any splits,
combinations or distributions in the form of equity issuances or the payment
of any Series C Alternative Conversion Consideration to the holders of the
Common Units in connection with the Change of Control.

 

(d) In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Units will
be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any
combination thereof) (" _Series C_ _Alternative Conversion Consideration_ "),
each Series C Holder electing to exercise its Series C Change of Control
Conversion Right will receive upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Units
elected by such holder the kind and amount of such Series C Alternative
Conversion Consideration on a per Series C Preferred Unit basis that such
Series C Holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Change
of Control had such Series C Holder held a number of Common Units equal to the
Series C Common Unit Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the
effective time of the Change of Control; _ provided_, _ that_, if
the holders of Common Units have the opportunity to elect the form of
consideration to be received in such Change of Control, the consideration that
the Series C Holders electing to exercise their Series C Change of Control
Conversion Right will receive will be the form and proportion of the
aggregate consideration elected by the holders of Common Units who participate
in the determination (based on the weighted average of elections) and will be
subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Units are subject,
including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion
of the consideration payable in the Change of Control. No fractional Common
Units will be issued upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred Units.
Instead, the Partnership shall pay the cash value of such fractional Common
Units.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior
to the expiration of the Partnerships redemption right contained in _Section
18.5(a)(iii)_ , the Partnership provides notice of its election to redeem
Series C Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 18.5_ , Series C Holders shall
not have any right to convert the Series C Preferred Units that the
Partnership has elected to redeem, and any Series C Preferred Units
subsequently selected for redemption that have been tendered for conversion
shall be redeemed on the Series C Redemption Date instead of converted on the
Series C Change of Control Conversion Date.

 

(f) The Partnership shall issue a press release for publication through a
news or press organization as is reasonably expected to broadly disseminate
the relevant information to the public, or post notice on the website of the
Partnership, in any event prior to the opening of

 



119  business on the first Business Day following any date on which the
Partnership (or a third party with its prior written consent) provides the
notice described in _Section 18.11(b)_ to the Series C Holders.

(g) Each Series C Holder electing to exercise its Series C Change
of Control Conversion Right will be required prior to the close of business
on the third Business Day preceding the Series C Change of Control Conversion
Date, to notify the Partnership of the number of Series C Preferred Units to
be converted pursuant to the Series C Change of Control Conversion Right and
otherwise to comply with any applicable procedures contained in the notice
described in _Section 18.11(b)_ or otherwise required by the Depositary for
effecting the conversion. 

(h) Upon conversion, the rights of such participating Series C Holder as a
holder of the Series C Preferred Units shall cease with respect to such
converted Series C Preferred Units, and such Person shall continue to be a
Partner and have the rights of a holder of Common Units under this Agreement.
Each Series C Preferred Unit shall, upon its Series C Change of Control
Conversion Date, be deemed to be transferred to, and cancelled by, the
Partnership in exchange for the issuance of the Series C Conversion Common
Units.

 

(i) The Partnership shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or
transfer taxes or duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Series C
Conversion Common Units. However, the participating Series C Holder shall pay
any tax or duty that may be payable relating to any transfer involving the
issuance or delivery of Series C Conversion Common Units in a name other than
such Series C Holders name. The Transfer Agent may refuse to reflect the
notation of book entry (or the issuance of a Certificate) for Common Units
being issued in a name other than the Series C Holders name until
the Transfer Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax or duties that
will be due because the Common Units are to be issued in a name other than the
Series C Holders name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding
required by law or regulation.

(j) The Partnership shall comply with all applicable securities laws
regulating the offer and delivery of any Series C Conversion Common Units
and, if the Common Units are then listed or quoted on a National Securities
Exchange or other market, shall list or cause to have quoted and keep listed
and quoted the Series C Conversion Common Units to the extent permitted or
required by the rules of such exchange or market.

(k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall
give to any Series C Holder any rights as a creditor in respect of its right
to conversion of Series C Preferred Units.

or Assignee at the address described below. Any notice, payment or report to
be given or made to a Partner or Assignee hereunder shall be deemed
conclusively to have been given or made, and the obligation to give such
notice or report or to make such payment shall be deemed conclusively to have
been fully satisfied, upon sending of such notice, payment or report to the
Record Holder of such Partnership Securities at his address as shown on the
records of the Transfer Agent or as otherwise shown on the records of
the Partnership, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an

otherwise. An affidavit or certificate of making of any notice, payment or
report in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 19.1_
executed by the General Partner, the Transfer Agent or the mailing
organization shall be prima facie evidence of the giving or making of such

Record Holder at the address of such Record Holder appearing on the books and
records of the Transfer Agent or the Partnership is returned by the United
States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States
Postal Service is unable to deliver it, such notice, payment or report and
any subsequent notices, payments and reports shall be deemed to have been duly
given or made without further mailing (until such time as such Record Holder
or another Person notifies the Transfer Agent or the Partnership of a change
in his address) if they are available for the Partner or Assignee at the
principal office of the Partnership for a period of one year from the date of
the giving or making of such notice, payment or report to the other Partners
and Assignees. Any notice to the Partnership shall be deemed given if received
by the General Partner at the principal office of the Partnership designated

protected in relying on any notice or other document from a Partner, Assignee
or other Person if believed by it to be genuine.

and take or refrain from taking action as may be necessary or appropriate to
achieve the purposes of this Agreement.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns.

SECTION 19.4 _Integration._

 

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings pertaining thereto.

SECTION 19.5 _Creditors._

 

None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, or shall
be enforceable by, any creditor of the Partnership.

 



121 SECTION 19.6 _Waiver._

 

No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant,
duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute waiver of any such
breach of any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition.

 

SECTION 19.7 _Counterparts._

 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which together shall
constitute an agreement binding on all the parties hereto, notwithstanding
that all such parties are not signatories to the original or the same
counterpart. Each party shall become bound by this Agreement immediately upon
affixing its signature hereto or, in the case of a Person acquiring a Unit,
upon accepting the certificate evidencing such Unit or executing and
delivering a Transfer Application as herein described, independently of the
signature of any other party.

 

SECTION 19.8 _Applicable Law._

 

This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of
law.

SECTION 19.9 _Invalidity of Provisions._

 

If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected thereby.

SECTION 19.10 _Consent of Partners._

 

Each Partner hereby expressly consents and agrees that, whenever in this
Agreement it is specified that an action may be taken upon the affirmative
vote or consent of less than all of the Partners, such action may be so taken
upon the concurrence of less than all of the Partners and each Partner shall
be bound by the results of such action.

sign the minutes or attend the meeting.

 



-4- (h) _Manner of Acting_. Members of the Board of Directors, or
any committee thereof, may participate in any meeting of the Board of

permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all persons serving on
the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto
in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of

of its proceedings and shall meet as provided by such rules or by resolution
adopted by the Member or the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise provided by
any such rules or resolutions, notice of the time and place of each meeting

except where required or permitted by law to be otherwise signed and executed
and except that the other officers of the Company may sign and execute
documents when so authorized by this Agreement, the Board of Directors or the
Chief Executive Officer and President. In the absence or disability of both
the Chairman of the Board of Directors and any Vice Chairman of the Board of
Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and President shall preside at all
meetings of the members and the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive
Officer and President shall also perform such other duties and may exercise
such other powers as from time to time may be assigned to him by this
Agreement or by the Board of Directors and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Chief Executive Officer and President may
appoint officers of the Company pursuant to and in accordance with authority
granted to him from time to time by the Board of Directors.

-9- 11. ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS.

to the Member.

 

13. DISTRIBUTIONS. 

 

Distributions shall be made one hundred percent (100%) to the Member at the
times and in the aggregate amounts determined by the Member. 

14. GOVERNING LAW. 

 

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed under, the internal laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws,
with all rights and remedies being governed by said laws.

15. INDEMNIFICATION. 

 

(a) _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party or
is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a
director or an officer of the Company or is or was serving at the request of
the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another company or of
a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to an employee benefit plan (" _Indemnitee_ "), whether the
basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as
a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Company to the fullest extent permitted or required by the
Act, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to
provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Company to
provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys fees, judgements, fines, ERISA excise taxes or
penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by
such Indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as
provided in Section 15(c) with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification, the Company shall indemnify any such Indemnitee in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Company.

 

(b) _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. The right to indemnification
conferred in this Section 15(b) shall include the right to be advanced by the
Company the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final
disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however,
that, if the Act so requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an
Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking (an " _Undertaking_
"), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if
it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there
is no further right to appeal (a " _Final Adjudication_ ") that such
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this
Section 15(b) or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses conferred in Sections 15(a) and 15(b) shall be
contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the Indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators.

 



-10- (c) _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section 15(a)
or 15(b) is not paid in full by the Company within 60 calendar days after a
written claim has been received by the Company, except in the case of a claim
for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall
be 20 calendar days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful
in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Company to
recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking,
the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or
defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the
Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a
defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Company to recover such
expenses upon a Final Adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Act. Neither the
failure of the Company (including its Board of Directors, independent legal
counsel or its Member) to have made a determination prior to the commencement
of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the
circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the Act, nor an actual determination by the Company
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its Member)
that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall
create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a
defense to such suit. If any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right
to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by
the Company to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of
an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to
be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Section 15 or
otherwise shall be on the Company.

 

(d) _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to
the advancement of expenses conferred in this Section 15 shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, this Agreement, vote of members or disinterested directors
or otherwise.

 

(e) _Insurance_. The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have
the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss
under the Act.

 



-11- (f) _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Company_. The Company
may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors,
grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any
employee or agent of the Company to the fullest extent of the provisions of
this Section 15 with respect to the indemnification and advancement of
expenses of directors and officers of the Company.

 

(g) _No Amendment, Modification or Repeal_. No amendment, modification or
repeal of this Section 15 or any provision hereof shall in any manner
terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or future
Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Company or the obligations of the Company
to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 15 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment,
modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to
matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification
or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

(h) _Ordering of Liability_. To the maximum extent permitted by law, as
between the Company, on the one hand, and the General Partner and the
Partnership or its subsidiaries (the " _Other Parties_ ") on the other hand,
this Section 15 shall be interpreted to reflect an ordering of liability for
potentially overlapping or duplicative indemnification or advance of expenses
payments, with the Other Parties having primary liability and the Company
having only secondary liability. The possibility that an Indemnitee
may receive indemnification or advancement of expenses payments from the
Other Parties shall not restrict the Company from making payments under this
Section 15 to an Indemnitee that is otherwise eligible for such payments, but
such payments by the Company are not intended to relieve the Other Parties
thereof from any liability that they would otherwise have to make
indemnification and advance payments to such Indemnitee and, if an Indemnitee
that has received indemnification or advancement payments from the Company
actually receives duplicative payments from the Other Parties (including from
any insurance policy maintained by such Other Parties), such Indemnitee shall
repay the Company to the extent of such duplicative payments.

 

16. CONSTRUCTION.

shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the
singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice
versa; (b) references to sections refer to sections of this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated; and (c) the term " _include_ " or " _includes_ " means
includes, without limitation, and " _including_ " means including, without
limitation.

 

17. AMENDMENT. 

 

Subject to Section 15, this Agreement may be amended or restated only by a
written instrument executed by the Member.
