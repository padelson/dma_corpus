ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION



1.1 Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings set forth
in Appendix A, unless the context otherwise requires.



1.2 References and Rules of Construction. All references in this Agreement to
Exhibits, Schedules, Appendices, Articles, Sections, subsections and other
subdivisions refer to the corresponding Exhibits, Schedules, Appendices,
Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of or to this Agreement
unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any
Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of this Agreement are
for convenience only, do not constitute any part of this Agreement, and shall
be disregarded in construing the language hereof. The words "this Agreement,"
"herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and words of similar import,
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section, subsection or other
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words "this Article," "this
Section" and "this subsection," and words of similar import, refer only to the
Article, Section or subsection hereof in which such words occur. Wherever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limiting the foregoing in
any respect." All references to "$" or "dollars" shall be deemed references to
United States dollars. Each accounting term not defined herein will have the
meaning given to it under GAAP as interpreted as of the Execution Date.
Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state
and include any other gender, and words, terms and titles (including terms
defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural
and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The words "shall" and
"will" are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement and shall
accordingly be given the same meaning, regardless of which word is used.
Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, references to any
Law or agreement means such Law or agreement as it may be amended from time to
time. References to any date means such date in Denver, Colorado and for
purposes of calculating the time period in which any notice or action is to be
given or undertaken hereunder, such period shall be deemed to begin at 12:01
a.m. on the applicable date in Denver, Colorado. The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" means the degree or proportion to which a subject or
other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". With respect
to all dates and time periods in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

as applicable;



(q) all geophysical, seismic and related technical data, cores and logs (in

above or the ownership or operation thereof, and, in each case, insofar and
only insofar as such matters are not already applied as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price;



(t) all JIB Receivables;



(u) the Conveyed Rights; and



(v) all (i) accounts receivable attributable to the Upstream Assets and

thereof, amounts owed by Persons other than Seller and its Affiliates with
respect to the Upstream Assets whether attributable to periods of time prior

2.3 Upstream Excluded Assets. Upstream Seller shall reserve and retain, on its
own behalf or on behalf of certain of its Affiliates, all of its and its
Affiliates' right, title and interest in and to the Excluded Assets.



2.4 Revenues and Expenses.



(a) For purposes of determining the amount of the adjustment to the Purchase
Price provided for in Section 3.3, the principles set forth in this Section
2.4 shall apply except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, (i) Upstream
Seller shall be entitled to all of the rights of ownership attributable to the
Upstream Assets (including the right to all production, proceeds of production
and other proceeds) and shall remain responsible for all Upstream Operating
Expenses, in each case, attributable to the period of time prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) Midstream Seller shall be entitled to all of the
rights of ownership attributable to the Midstream Interests and shall remain
responsible for all Midstream Operating Expenses, in each case, attributable
to the period of time prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the occurrence
of the Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to all of the rights of ownership
attributable to the Upstream Assets (including the right to all production,
proceeds of production and other proceeds) and Midstream Interests, and shall
be responsible for all Operating Expenses attributable thereto, in each case,
from and after the Effective Time. Subject to the occurrence of Closing and
subject to Section 2.4(b), Section 2.4(c), Section 2.4(d), Section 2.4(e) and
Section 15.2(b), all Operating Expenses that are: (i) incurred with respect to
operations conducted or production prior to the Effective Time shall be paid
by or allocated to Seller; and (ii) incurred with respect to operations
conducted or production from and after the Effective Time shall be paid by or
allocated to Buyer. Such amounts that are received or paid prior to Closing
shall be accounted for in the Preliminary Settlement Statement or Final
Settlement Statement as applicable. After Closing, each Party shall be
entitled to participate in all joint interest audits and other audits of
Operating Expenses for which such Party is entirely or in part responsible
under the terms of this Section 2.4; provided, that Buyer shall control any
such joint audit on behalf of the Parties and shall not agree to any
adjustments to previously assessed costs for which Seller is liable, or any
compromise of any audit claims to which Seller would be entitled, without the
prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any expenses from such audit shall be borne
by Buyer and Seller in the same proportion as the Operating Expenses at issue
are or would be borne by Buyer and Seller. Buyer shall provide Seller with a
copy of all applicable audit reports and written audit agreements received by
Buyer or its Affiliates and relating to periods for which Seller is wholly or
partially responsible.



(b) Such amounts that are received or paid after Closing but prior to the date
of the Final Settlement Statement shall be accounted for in the Final
Settlement Statement. After the agreement of Buyer and Seller upon the Final
Settlement Statement (or determination thereof), but prior to the two-year
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Cut-Off Date"), (i) if any Party
receives monies that would belong to any other Party pursuant to this Section
2.4, including proceeds of production, then such amount shall, within 60 days
after the end of the calendar month in which such amounts were received, be
paid by such receiving Party to the proper Party, (ii) if any Party pays
monies for Operating Expenses which are the obligation of any other Party
pursuant to this Section 2.4, then such other Party shall, within 60 days
after the end of the calendar month in which the applicable invoice and proof
of payment of such invoice were received by such other Party, reimburse the
Party which paid such Operating Expenses, (iii) if a Party receives an invoice
of an Upstream Operating Expense which is owed by another Party pursuant to
this Section 2.4, such Party receiving the invoice shall promptly forward such
invoice to the Party obligated to pay the same, (iv) if Seller receives an
invoice of a Midstream Operating Expense which is owed by Buyer or the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 2.4, Seller shall promptly forward such
invoice to Buyer and the Partnership, (v) if Buyer or the Partnership receives
an invoice of a Midstream Operating Expense which is owed by Seller pursuant
to this Section 2.4, Buyer or the Partnership shall pay the applicable invoice
in accordance with its terms and following such payment forward a request for
reimbursement of such paid amount to Seller, and Seller shall thereafter
reimburse Buyer or the Partnership, as applicable, within 30 days of Seller's
receipt of the same, and (vi) if an invoice for Operating Expenses is received
by a Party, which is partially an obligation of two or more Parties pursuant
to this Section 2.4, then the relevant Parties shall consult with each other,
and each shall promptly pay (or reimburse to Buyer or the Partnership, as
applicable, in the event Seller owes any Midstream Operating Expense) its
portion of such Operating Expenses.

 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, the date an item or work is ordered is not the
date of a transaction for settlement purposes in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement or Final Settlement Statement and otherwise under this Agreement, as
applicable, but rather the date on which the item ordered is delivered to the
job site, or the date on which the work ordered is performed, is the relevant
date, regardless of when the applicable invoice was sent. "Earned" and
"incurred", as used in this Agreement, shall be interpreted in accordance with
GAAP and COPAS standards, as applied by Seller in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, subject to the other provisions of
this Section 2.4. For purposes of allocating production (and accounts
receivable with respect thereto), under this Section 2.4, (i) liquid
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Wells when
they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into
which they are transported from the lands covered by the applicable Well, or
if there are no storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT meter or
similar meter at the entry point into the pipelines through which they are
transported from such lands, and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to
be "from or attributable to" the Wells when they pass through the production
meters, flare meters, fuel use equipment, venting, or delivery point sales
meters or similar meters at the entry point into the pipelines through which
they are transported from such lands. Liquid Hydrocarbons in storage shall be
measured by gauging of tanks at the Effective Time. Seller shall utilize
reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of production
when exact meter readings (including gas production meters or sales meters) or
gauging data is not available.



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.4, (i) Seller
shall be entitled to offset any amounts owed by Seller or its Affiliates to
Buyer or its Affiliates under this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents against any amounts owed by Buyer or its Affiliates to Seller or its
Affiliates under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents and (ii)
Buyer shall be entitled to offset any amounts owed by Buyer or its Affiliates
to Seller or its Affiliates under this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents against any amounts owed by Seller its Affiliates to Buyer or its
Affiliates under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents.



(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that, notwithstanding
anything in this Section 2.4, Section 8.2 or otherwise in this Agreement to
the contrary, from and after the Cut-Off Date, Buyer shall be responsible for
all Operating Expenses and, shall be entitled to all proceeds, in each case,
related to the Upstream Assets and Midstream Interests, regardless of when
such Operating Expenses were incurred or paid or when such proceeds of
production were earned or received. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
2.4, Section 8.2 or otherwise in this Agreement to the contrary, from and
after the Cut-Off Date, Seller shall (i) not be responsible for, or otherwise
required to pay, any Operating Expenses, regardless when the same were
incurred or paid, and (ii) not be entitled to any amounts received by Buyer or
its Affiliates after the Cut-Off Date.



2.5 Midstream Interests Adjustment Procedures. For the avoidance of doubt, no
item that is included in or taken into account in the calculation of Effective
Time Working Capital shall be subject to any other adjustment to the Purchase
Price.



(a) In making the adjustments contemplated under Section 3.3(a)(vii) or
Section 3.3(b)(x), as applicable, the provisions of this Section 2.5 shall be
taken into account; provided, the remainder of this Section 2.5, other than
Section 2.5(d), shall in no way be construed as a limitation to the definition
of any of Effective Time Working Capital, Working Capital Assets and Working
Capital Liabilities.



(b) The following shall be deemed to constitute Working Capital Assets
(without duplication):

 (i) all (A) Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Partnership at the Effective
Time, and (B) unpaid refunds payable to the Partnership on account of
deposits, prepayments or similar items as set forth on Schedule 2.5(b)(i), and
all insurance proceeds receivables of the Partnership attributable to periods
prior to the Effective Time as set forth on Schedule 2.5(b)(i);



(ii) the amount of all pre-paid or deposited Midstream Operating Expenses and
all other costs and expenses (other than Taxes) paid by or on behalf of the
Partnership prior to the Effective Time that are attributable to the ownership
of the Midstream Interests after the Effective Time, including bond and
insurance premiums and deductibles paid or borne by or on behalf of the
Partnership with respect to any period after the Effective Time (prorated as
applicable);



(iii) all current Tax assets (other than Income Tax assets) of the Partnership
related to prepaid deposits and refunds attributable to periods prior to the
Effective Time; and



(iv) unpaid proceeds, receivables and amounts earned as of the Effective Time
and any other unpaid amounts earned by the Partnership, in each case during
any period before the Effective Time, excluding (i) all Pre-ET Intercompany
Receivables and (ii) any receivables and other amounts that are more than 90
days past due except to the extent a corresponding allowance for doubtful
accounts is included as a Working Capital Liability).



(c) The following shall be deemed to constitute Working Capital Liabilities
(without duplication):



(i) the amount of all Midstream Operating Expenses that are unpaid as of the
Effective Time that are attributable to the ownership of the Midstream
Interests prior to the Effective Time, including bond and insurance premiums
and deductibles paid or borne by or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates with
respect to any period after the Effective Time (prorated as applicable);



(ii) all current Tax liabilities (other than Income Tax liabilities)
attributable to periods prior to the Effective Time;



(iii) all capital expenditures of the Partnership accrued but not paid as of
the Effective Time;



(iv) Transaction Costs incurred but not yet paid by the Partnership at the
Effective Time; and



(v) any Liabilities incurred or paid by the Partnership from and after the
Effective Time until the Closing Date that (A) constitute Seller Obligations
or Indebtedness or (B) were not so incurred or paid in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice, whether such Liabilities relate to
pre- or post-Effective Time periods.



(d) The following shall be excluded from the calculation of Effective Time
Working Capital (and shall not be included as a Working Capital Asset or
Working Capital Liability):



(i) all Excluded Assets held by the Partnership, including all Partnership
Excluded Assets;

 (ii) all pre-Effective Time accounts receivable of the Partnership and any
other obligations owed by any of Midstream Seller or its Affiliates to the
Partnership, including all applicable accounts receivable evidencing
Indebtedness, accounts, and obligations (collectively, "Pre-ET Intercompany
Receivables");



(iii) all Indebtedness, accounts, and Liabilities owed by the Partnership to
any of Midstream Seller or its Affiliates ("Intercompany Payables"); and



(iv) all Third Party Debt and other Indebtedness of the Partnership.

all amounts payable by Upstream Seller pursuant to the QEP Gas Services
Agreement for periods from and after the Effective Time until Closing) attributable to such Hydrocarbons paid or borne by Upstream
Seller or its Affiliates and not reimbursed by a Third Party (and such
adjustment shall be Buyer's sole remedy with respect to the proceeds of such
Hydrocarbons for which such adjustment is made);

Section 13.2(j) and Section 14.1(f)) or otherwise agreed upon by Seller and
Buyer.



3.4 Preliminary Settlement Statement. Not less than five Business Days prior
to the Scheduled Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and submit to Buyer for
review a draft settlement statement (the "Preliminary Settlement Statement")
that shall set forth the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting each adjustment
made in accordance with this Agreement as of the date of preparation of such
Preliminary Settlement Statement and the itemized calculation and reasonable
supporting documentation of the adjustments used to determine such amount,
together with the designation of Seller's account(s) for the wire transfers of
funds as set forth in Section 6.3(f). When available, actual figures will be
used for the determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price at Closing. To the
extent actual figures are not available, good faith estimates will be used
subject to final adjustments in accordance with Section 3.5 and Section 3.6.
Within two Business Days of receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement,
Buyer will deliver to Seller a written report containing all changes with the
explanation therefor that Buyer proposes to be made to the Preliminary
Settlement Statement. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by
the Parties, will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing; provided
that if the Parties do not agree upon an adjustment set forth in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement, then the amount of such adjustment used to
adjust the Purchase Price at Closing shall be that amount set forth in the
draft Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by Seller to Buyer pursuant
to this Section 3.4.



3.5 Final Settlement Statement. On or before 180 days after the Closing, a
final settlement statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") will be prepared
by Seller based on actual income and expenses during the period from and after
the Effective Time until Closing and which takes into account all final
adjustments made to the Purchase Price and shows the resulting final Adjusted
Purchase Price. The Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual
proration of the amounts required by this Agreement. As soon as practicable,
and in any event within 30 days after receipt of the Final Settlement
Statement, Buyer shall return to Seller a written report containing any
proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of any
such changes and the reasons therefor (the "Dispute Notice"). Buyer's failure
to deliver to Seller a Dispute Notice detailing proposed changes to the Final
Settlement Statement by such date shall be deemed to be an acceptance by Buyer
of the Final Settlement Statement delivered by Seller and any changes to the
Final Settlement Statement as initially prepared by Seller that are proposed
or requested by Buyer and not included in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed
waived, and Seller's determinations with respect to all such adjustments in
the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed in the Dispute Notice
shall prevail. If the final Purchase Price set forth in the Final Settlement
Statement is mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer or deemed agreed
pursuant to the foregoing (or determined by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant
to Section 3.6), the Final Settlement Statement and such final Adjusted
Purchase Price (the "Final Price"), shall be final and binding on the Parties.
Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase Price as paid at Closing pursuant to
the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be paid by the
owing Party on or before the date that is ten Business Days following
agreement or deemed agreement (or determination by the Accounting Arbitrator,
as applicable) (such date, the "Final Payment Date") to the owed Party. All
amounts paid or transferred pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be delivered in
United States currency by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in writing by the relevant Party.



3.6 Disputes. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed
in the Dispute Notice, each of Buyer and Seller shall within 25 Business Days
after the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize its position with regard
to such dispute in a written document of 20 pages or less and submit such
summaries to the Denver office of KPMG US LLP or such other Person as the
Parties may mutually select (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), together with the
Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement Statement, this Agreement and any other
documentation such Party may desire to submit. Within 20 Business Days after
receiving the Parties' respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall
determine such items of the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price after
the dispute is submitted to it, based on the materials described above. To the
extent that a value has been assigned by Buyer or Seller to any item subject
to dispute that is submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator, the Accounting
Arbitrator shall not assign a value to objection that is greater than the
greatest value for such objection claimed by either Party or less than the
smallest value for such objection claimed by either Party. Any decision
rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final,
conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer and will be enforceable against any
of the Parties in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each Party shall bear
its own costs with respect to any matters addressed in this Section 3.6. In
the event that the Denver office of KPMG US LLP declines to serve as the
Accounting Arbitrator, then each of Buyer and Seller may deliver to each other
a list of up to three independent national accounting firms and the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be selected by lot from among the independent national
accounting firms submitted by the Parties. The costs of the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller; provided,
however, that the Accounting Arbitrator shall have the discretion to allocate
all or a portion of its costs to the "losing" Party in connection with any
such dispute. The Accounting Arbitrator shall be authorized to resolve only
the specific disputed aspects of the Final Settlement Statement submitted by
the Parties as provided above and, subject to the immediately preceding
sentence, may not award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with
respect to any matter.



3.7 Allocation of Purchase Price / Allocated Values. Buyer and Seller agree
that (a) the unadjusted Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Upstream
Assets and Midstream Interests as set forth in Schedule 3.7A, (b) the
unadjusted Purchase Price attributable to the Upstream Assets as set forth on
Schedule 3.7A shall be allocated among the Wells and the Well Locations as set
forth in Schedule 3.7B and Schedule 3.7C, as applicable (for the Midstream
Interests and each such Well and Well Location, its "Allocated Value"), (c)
the Allocated Values shall be used in calculating adjustments to the Purchase
Price as provided herein, (d) the Allocated Values, as adjusted, shall be used
by Seller and Buyer as the basis for reporting asset values and other items
for purposes of this Section 3.7, and (e) subject to Section 3.8, neither
Party nor their Affiliates will take positions inconsistent with such
Allocated Values in notices to Governmental Authorities, in audit or other
proceedings with respect to Taxes, in connection with Preferential Purchase
Rights or in other documents or notices relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



3.8 Allocation of Consideration for Tax Purposes. Seller and Buyer agree that
the portion of the Purchase Price, as adjusted, and other amounts treated for
Tax purposes as consideration (to the extent known at such time)
(collectively, the "Allocable Amount") shall be allocated among the Upstream
Assets and the Midstream Assets for Tax purposes. The initial draft of such
allocations shall be prepared by Buyer in a manner consistent with Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and such
initial draft shall be provided to Seller no later than 120 days after the
Closing for Seller's review and comment. Seller and Buyer shall then cooperate
in good faith to prepare a final schedule of the Allocable Amount among the
Assets (as adjusted, the "Allocation Schedule"). The Allocation Schedule shall
be updated to reflect any adjustments to the Allocable Amount. The allocation
of the Allocable Amount shall be reflected on a completed Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060), which Form will be timely filed separately by Seller and Buyer with the
Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the requirements of Section 1060(b) of
the Code. Seller and Buyer agree not to take any position inconsistent with
the allocations set forth in the Allocation Schedule unless required to do so
by a determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any other
similar provision of state or local law) or with the consent of the other
Parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, however, that neither Party shall be unreasonably impeded
in its ability and discretion to concede, negotiate, compromise and/or settle
any Tax audit, claim or similar proceeding in connection with the allocation
set forth on the Allocation Schedule.



3.9 Allocation for Imbalances. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, if, prior to Closing, any Party discovers an error in the
Imbalances set forth in Schedule 9.12(a) and Schedule 9.12(b), then,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, as the applicable Party's

which the Purchase Price is so adjusted. If, after the Closing, any Party
discovers an error in the Imbalances set forth in Schedule 9.12(a) and
Schedule 9.12(b) on or before the date of the delivery of the Final Settlement

(a) by the mutual written agreement of the Parties;



(b) by delivery of written notice from Buyer to Seller if any of the
conditions set forth in Article IV (other than the conditions set forth in
Section 4.3, Section 4.4, Section 4.5 and Section 4.8) have not been satisfied
by Seller (or waived by Buyer) by the Outside Date;



(c) by delivery of written notice from Seller to Buyer if any of the

Section 5.3, Section 5.4, Section 5.5 and Section 5.8) have not been satisfied
by Buyer (or waived by Seller) by the Outside Date;



(d) by either Party delivering written notice to the other Party if any of the
conditions set forth in Section 4.3, Section 4.4, Section 4.5, Section 5.3,
Section 5.4, or Section 5.5 are not satisfied or waived by the applicable
Party as of the Outside Date, subject to the proviso in Section 4.4 in respect

expiration of the initial waiting period under the HSR Act (or early
termination thereof), in each case, if all other conditions to the Closing are

have not been satisfied; and



(f) by Buyer pursuant to Section 13.3(c); and



(g) by seller if the Deposit has not been delivered to the Escrow Agent within

its Affiliates are at such time in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

7.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any
provision of Section 7.1, then, except as provided in this Section 7.2 and
except for the provisions of Article I, Section 7.3, Section 8.11, Sections
12.1(d) through (f), Section 12.2, Section 12.3, Article XV (other than
Section 15.2(b), Section 15.2(c)(i), Section 15.7, Section 15.8, Section 15.15
and Section 15.16) and Appendix A, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and of no further force or effect and the Parties shall have no liability or
obligation hereunder. Each Party agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, such Party's rights set forth in this Section 7.2 shall be its sole
and exclusive remedies (other than with respect to those provisions that
survive termination pursuant to the preceding sentence) if the Closing does
not occur as a result of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1.



(a) If Seller has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c) because of (i) the Willful Breach by Buyer of this Agreement, or (ii)
the failure of Buyer to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in the instance where, as of the Outside Date, (A) all of the conditions in
Article IV (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied
until the Closing) have been satisfied (or waived by Buyer), (B) Seller is
ready, willing and able to perform its obligations under Section 6.3, and (C)
Buyer nevertheless elects not to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then, in either such event Seller shall be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) and be entitled to receive the
Deposit and the Escrow Earnings as liquidated damages as Seller's sole and
exclusive remedy, and not as a penalty, for such termination, free and clear
of any claims thereon by Buyer. The Parties agree that the foregoing described
liquidated damages are reasonable considering all of the circumstances
existing as of the Execution Date and constitute the Parties' good faith
estimate of the actual damages reasonably expected to result from such
termination of this Agreement by Seller. If Seller is entitled to receive the
Deposit and the Escrow Earnings pursuant to this Section 7.2(a), within five
Business Days of the date this Agreement is terminated, Seller and Buyer shall
execute and deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver all of
the funds in the Escrow Account to Seller.



(b) If Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(b) because of (i) the Willful Breach by Seller of this Agreement, or (ii)
the failure of Seller to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in the instance where, as of the Outside Date, (A) all of the conditions in
Article V (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied
until the Closing) have been satisfied (or waived by Seller), (B) Buyer is ready, willing and able to perform its
obligations under Section 6.3, and (C) Seller nevertheless elects not to close
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then, in either such event,
Buyer shall be entitled to (1) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(b) and be entitled to receive the Deposit and the Escrow Earnings, free
and clear of any claims thereon by Seller, and seek to recover actual, direct
damages (subject to Section 8.11) from Seller up to but not exceeding the
aggregate amount of the Deposit and the Escrow Earnings or (2) seek to obtain
the specific performance of Seller hereunder. If Buyer is entitled to receive
the Deposit and the Escrow Earnings pursuant to this Section 7.2(b), within
five Business Days of the date this Agreement is terminated, Seller and Buyer
shall execute and deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver
all of the funds in the Escrow Account to Buyer. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit Buyer from first seeking specific performance, but
thereafter terminating this Agreement and receiving the Deposit and the Escrow
Earnings and seeking to recover actual, direct damages (as limited by Section
8.11) from Seller up to but not exceeding the amount of the Deposit. Each
Party acknowledges and agrees that the remedies at Law of Buyer for a breach
or threatened breach of this Agreement by Seller as contemplated pursuant to
Section 7.2(b)(i) or Section 7.2(b)(ii) are likely inadequate and, in
recognition of this fact, Buyer, without posting any bond or the necessity or
proving the inadequacy as a remedy of monetary damages, and in addition to all
other remedies that may be available, shall be entitled to seek to obtain
equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining
order, a temporary or permanent injunction and/or any other equitable remedy
that may then be available.



(c) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than as set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), then the Parties shall have no liability or
obligation hereunder as a result of such termination, and Buyer and Seller
shall, within five Business Days of the date this Agreement is terminated,
provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release all of the
funds in the Escrow Account to Buyer free and clear of any claims thereon by
Seller.



(d) Subject to the foregoing, upon the termination of this Agreement neither
Party shall have any other liability or obligation hereunder.



(e) Seller's retention of the Deposit and the Escrow Earnings pursuant to
Section 7.2(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller against Buyer,
the Financing Sources and their respective Affiliates for any and all losses,
claims, expenses, liabilities or damages suffered or incurred by Seller or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement, the Financings (and the
termination thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and
the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis of
such termination and none of the Financing Sources shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Financings or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination upon payment of such amount.



7.3 Return of Documentation and Confidentiality. Upon termination of this
Agreement, Buyer shall return to Seller all title, engineering, geological and
geophysical data, environmental assessments and/or reports, maps, documents
and other information furnished by Seller to Buyer or prepared by or on behalf
of Buyer in connection with its due diligence investigation of the Assets and
an officer of Buyer shall certify same to Seller in writing.

8.7 Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification under this
Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:



(a) The term "Indemnifying Party" when used in connection with particular
Liabilities means the Party or Parties having an obligation to indemnify
another Party or Parties with respect to such Liabilities pursuant to this
Article VIII, Section 11.4(c), Section 11.12(c), Section 11.15, Section 11.16,
Section 12.1(c), Section 13.4(a) or Section 13.4(b), and the term "Indemnified

11.12(c), Section 11.15, Section 11.16, Section 12.1(c), Section 13.4(a) or
Section 13.4(b).



(b) To make claim for indemnification under Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section
11.4(c), Section 11.12(c), Section 11.15, Section 11.16, Section 12.1(c),
Section 13.4(a) or Section 13.4(b) an Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party of its claim under this Section 8.7, including the material
details of and basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice").
In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a
Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party
shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served
with respect to the Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party
to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 8.7 shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 8.2, Section 8.3,
Section 11.4(c), Section 11.12(c), Section 11.15, Section 11.16, Section
12.1(c), Section 13.4(a) or Section 13.4(b) (as applicable) except to the
extent (and then only to the extent) such failure materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the Claim. In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.



(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its liability to
defend the Indemnified Party against such Claim at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and
during such 30 day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that
it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of
the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.



(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof unless the
compromise or settlement includes the payment of any amount by (because of the
Indemnity Deductible or otherwise), the performance of any obligation by or
the limitation of any right or benefit of, the Indemnified Party, in which
event such settlement or compromise shall not be effective without the consent
of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to
cooperate, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, in
contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Section 8.7(d). An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent
of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto which does not include an unconditional written
release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim
or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may
materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result
of money damages covered by the indemnity).



(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability (which it will be
deemed to have so done if it fails to timely respond) or admits its liability
but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Claim, then the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to defend against the Claim at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party's
choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its
liability and assume the defense of the Claim at any time prior to settlement
or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted
its liability for a Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written notice to
the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party
shall have the option for ten days following receipt of such notice to (i)
admit in writing its liability for the Claim and (ii) if liability is so
admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement.



(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
(i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its liability for such
Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30 day period that it
has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for such Liabilities,
then the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to be disputing the claim for such
Liabilities.



(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.7 to the contrary, with respect
to the Retained Litigation: (i) Seller shall have full control of any defense
and proceedings relating to such Retained Litigation, including any compromise
or settlement thereof, unless such compromise or settlement (A) includes or
results in the payment of any amount by any Buyer, the Partnership or any
other Affiliate of Buyer that will not be paid by Seller on behalf of such
Person, (B) includes or results in the performance of any obligation by, or
the limitation of any right or benefit of, Buyer, the Partnership or any other

Partnership or any other Affiliate of Buyer (other than as a result of money

consistent with past practice, (F) includes, or results in any payment based

royalty under any Lease from the methodology or principles historically used
by Seller, or (G) does not include an unconditional written release of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties from each claimant and/or plaintiff under such
Retained Litigation with respect to the period from and after the Effective
Time, in which event such settlement or compromise shall not be effective
without the consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; (ii) if requested by Seller, Buyer agrees to cooperate, at the sole
cost and expense of Seller, in the defense, settlement and resolution of any
Retained Litigation; and (iii) Buyer may participate in, at Buyer's sole cost
and expense, but not control, any defense, settlement and resolution of any
Retained Litigation.

(or supplemental authorizations for expenditure for cost overruns) relating to
operations in which Upstream Seller has agreed to participate in writing as of
the Execution Date or in which Upstream Seller agrees to participate after the
Execution Date in compliance with this Section 11.1 or otherwise make or

(c) Without expanding any obligations which Seller may have to Buyer, it is
expressly agreed that Seller shall never have any Liability to Buyer with
respect to any breach or failure of Section 11.1(a)(i) or Section 11.1(a)(iv),
to the extent such breach relates to the physical operation of the Assets,
greater than that which it might have as the operator to a non-operator under
the applicable operating agreement (or, in the absence of such an agreement,
under the AAPL 610 (1989 Revision) form Operating Agreement), IT BEING
RECOGNIZED THAT, UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS AND SUCH FORM, THE OPERATOR IS NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OTHER THAN FOR
ITS OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.



(d) Buyer acknowledges Seller owns undivided interests in certain of the
properties comprising the Upstream Assets that it is not the operator thereof,
and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of the other interest owners
(including the operators) who are not Seller or any Affiliates of Seller shall
not constitute a breach of the provisions of this Section 11.1, nor shall any
action required by a vote of Working Interest owners constitute such a breach
so long as Seller has voted its interest in a manner that complies with the
provisions of this Section 11.1.



(e) With respect to any AFE or similar request received by Upstream Seller
that is estimated to cost in excess of $250,000 in respect of the Upstream
Assets, Upstream Seller shall forward such AFE to Buyer as soon as is
reasonably practicable, together with Upstream Seller's recommendation as to
whether Upstream Seller should participate in such operation and materials in
Upstream Seller's possession on which such recommendation is based, and
thereafter the Parties shall consult with each other regarding whether or not
Upstream Seller should elect to participate in such operation. Buyer agrees
that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to timely respond to any
written request for consent pursuant to this Section 11.1(e) or Section
11.1(a) or Section 11.1(b). In the event the Parties are unable to agree
within five days (unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the
circumstances or the applicable joint operating agreement) of Buyer's receipt
of any consent request as to whether or not Upstream Seller should elect to
participate in such operation, Upstream Seller's decision with respect thereto
shall control; provided Upstream Seller (i) will act as a reasonably prudent
oil and gas operator in making elections under each Lease, operating
agreement, unit agreement, contract for development and other similar
instrument or agreement (including all determinations with respect to pooling and unitization, elections
concerning abandonment of any Well or release of any Lease or Well) and (ii)
will in good faith consult with Buyer and consider any reasonable alternative
proposed by Buyer to achieve the desired result of each of the Parties with
respect to the applicable operation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 11.1, in the event of an emergency, Seller may take such action as
reasonably necessary in accordance with prudent industry practices and shall
notify Buyer of such action promptly thereafter.



(f) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary (i) Upstream Seller shall have the
right to control and make adjustments with respect to Burdens paid by Seller
to Governmental Authorities, to the extent the same relate to pre-Effective
Time periods, in order to comply with applicable Laws and the terms of the
Leases and any relevant Contracts, and (ii) Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller's efforts and actions in
connection therewith.



(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, without
limiting the provisions of Section 2.4 and Section 3.3, Midstream Seller shall
(i) have the right at any time to cause the Partnership to distribute (or make
dividends or distribution with respect to) cash of the Partnership and (ii)
cause the Partnership to distribute all pre-Effective Time accounts
receivables of the Partnership to Midstream Seller or its Affiliates at any
time prior to Closing; provided, that such right shall not include the right
to declare dividends or distributions prior to the Closing that are payable
after the Closing (with the exception of the settlement of Intercompany
Receivables and Intercompany Payables through journal entry accounting in
which no cash or assets of the Partnership are actually paid or distributed).



(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall
have the right at any time prior to Closing to, or to cause the Partnership
to, utilize all or part of the Mitigation Credits in the operation of the
Upstream Assets and/or Midstream Assets.



11.2 Successor Operator. While Buyer acknowledges that it desires to succeed
Upstream Seller as operator of those Upstream Assets or portions thereof that
Upstream Seller may presently operate, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
Seller cannot and does not covenant or warrant that Buyer shall become
successor operator of such Upstream Assets since the Upstream Assets or
portions thereof may be subject to operating or other agreements that control
the appointment of a successor operator. Upstream Seller agrees, however,
that, as to the Upstream Assets it operates, it shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to support Buyer's efforts to become successor operator of
such Upstream Assets (to the extent permitted under any applicable joint
operating agreement or other applicable agreement) effective as of Closing (at
Buyer's sole cost and expense) and to designate and/or appoint, to the extent
legally possible and permitted under any applicable joint operating agreement
or other applicable agreement, Buyer as successor operator of such Assets
effective as of Closing.



11.3 HSR Act. If applicable, within ten Business Days following the Execution
Date, Buyer and Seller will each prepare and simultaneously file with the DOJ
and the FTC the notification and report form required for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the HSR Act and request early termination of
the waiting period thereunder. Buyer and Seller agree to respond promptly to
any inquiries from the DOJ or the FTC concerning such filings and to comply in
all material respects with the filing requirements of the HSR Act. Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate with each other and, subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, shall promptly furnish all information to the other
Party that is necessary in connection with Buyer's and Seller's compliance
with the HSR Act. Buyer and Seller shall keep each other fully advised with
respect to any requests from or communications with the DOJ or FTC concerning
such filings and shall consult with each other with respect to all responses
thereto. Each of Seller and Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary and
appropriate in connection with any HSR Act filing to consummate the
transactions consummated hereby; provided, however, that neither Party will be
required to (a) sell or otherwise dispose of, hold separate, or agree to sell
or otherwise dispose of any of the Assets or any other assets of Seller or its
Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates, (b) terminate existing relationships or
contractual rights and obligations, including any joint venture or other
arrangement, or (c) effectuate any change or restructuring of any Person.
Buyer shall bear 100% of the filing fees of the HSR Act filings.



11.4 Credit Support.



(a) Buyer acknowledges that none of the bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees, if any, posted by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Partnership) with Governmental Authorities or any other Third Party and
relating to the Upstream Assets or Midstream Business (collectively, the
"Credit Support") are transferable to Buyer. On or before the Closing Date,
Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of Buyer or the
Partnership, as applicable, replacements for the Credit Support to the extent
such replacements are necessary (i) to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to permit the cancellation of the
Credit Support with respect to the Upstream Assets and/or Midstream Business;
provided Buyer shall not be required to provide bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees in amounts pursuant to this Section 11.4(a)(ii) in excess of the
Credit Support items set forth on Schedule 9.28.



(b) In addition, at or prior to Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller
evidence of the posting of bonds or other security with all applicable
Governmental Authorities and all applicable Third Parties, including those set
forth on Schedule 9.28, meeting the requirements of such Governmental
Authorities and such Third Parties to (i) own and, if applicable, operate the
Upstream Assets as of the Closing Date, (ii) own the Midstream Interests as of
the Closing Date, and (iii) operate the Midstream Business as of the Closing
Date.



(c) In the event that any Governmental Authority or any Third Party does not
permit the cancellation of any Credit Support posted by Seller and/or any
Affiliate of Seller (other than the Partnership), then, from and after
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties against all
Liabilities incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties under such Credit
Support (and all Liabilities incurred in connection with such Credit Support).
At the Closing, Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in Seller's
efforts to obtain the return to Seller or its applicable Affiliate of any cash
deposits constituting Credit Support that are provided, funded, or otherwise
supported by any Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Upstream
Assets or Midstream Business and, to the extent any such amounts are released
to Buyer, Buyer shall promptly pay such amounts to Upstream Seller.



11.5 Record Retention. Buyer, for a period of seven years following the
Closing, will, and will cause the Partnership to, as applicable, (a) retain
the Records, (b) provide Seller, its Affiliates and its and their officers,
employees and Representatives with access to the Records (to the extent that
Seller has not retained the original or a copy) during normal business hours
for review and copying at Seller's expense, and (c) provide Seller, its
Affiliates and its and their officers, employees and Representatives with
access, during normal business hours, to materials received after the Closing
that would have constituted "Records" (and not "Excluded Records") if the same
were in existence as of the Closing Date and that relate to any indemnity
claim made under Section 8.2 for review and copying at Seller's expense. If
Buyer desires to destroy any Records within such seven year period, Buyer
shall notify Seller in writing at least ten (10 Business Days in advance prior
to such destruction and provide Seller the opportunity to take possession of
the same at Seller's sole cost and expense, after which time Buyer shall have
no obligation under this Section 11.5. 

11.6 Amendment of Schedules. Buyer agrees that, with respect to the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, Seller
shall have the continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or amend the
Schedules to its representations and warranties with respect to any matter.
For all purposes of and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement,
including for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
Article IV (except Section 4.6, as related to Section 4.1, but without
affecting the conditions set forth in Section 4.1 or Buyer's rights with
respect thereto) have been fulfilled and Buyer's rights under Article VIII,
Article XIII and Article XIV, the Schedules to Seller's representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to include only that
information contained therein on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to
exclude all information contained in any addition, supplement or amendment
thereto.



11.7 Notifications. Each Party shall provide prompt written notice to the
other Party following receipt by such Party or its Affiliates (including the
Partnership) of any written notice of any lawsuit or action from any Third
Party that seeks to restrain the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



11.8 Removal of Name. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within 90
days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate the names "QEP" and
"Questar", and any variants thereof, from the Upstream Assets and Midstream
Assets acquired pursuant to this Agreement and, except with respect to such
grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use any
logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.



11.9 FCC Filings. Seller and Buyer shall, and Seller shall cause its
Affiliates to, as applicable, prepare, as soon as is practical following the
Execution Date, any necessary filings in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that may be required to be filed by the Parties
or any Affiliate thereof with the Federal Communications Commission with
respect to transfer of the Assigned FCC Licenses. Any fees associated with the
transfer of the Assigned FCC Licenses or payable to the Federal Communications
Commission with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
or the Transaction Documents shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer, and
Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any such fees incurred by Seller and its
Affiliates prior to Closing. Seller and Buyer shall, and Seller shall cause
its Affiliates to, as applicable, promptly furnish each other with copies of
any notices, correspondence or other written communication from the FCC, shall
promptly make any appropriate or necessary subsequent or supplemental filings
and shall cooperate in the preparation of such filings as is reasonably
necessary and appropriate. In addition, at or prior to, or as soon as
practical after, the Closing, Buyer shall deliver evidence to Seller of its
Federal Registry Number with respect to the Assigned FCC Licenses and its
designation of an applicable contact person with respect to the Assigned FCC
Licenses. Promptly following Closing, Buyer and Seller shall, and Seller shall
cause its Affiliates to, as applicable, execute and deliver the forms and
documents required by the applicable Governmental Authority to transfer the
Assigned FCC Licenses to Buyer.



11.10 Employee Matters.



(a) On or after the Execution Date and at reasonable times approved by Seller,
Buyer or its Affiliate may interview and/or make offers of employment (each an
"Offer") to those employees of Seller set forth on Schedule 11.10 (each a
"Permitted Employee") and conduct such lawful, standard employee screening and
eligibility procedures with regard to the potential employment of any
Permitted Employee as Buyer or any such Affiliate typically conducts with
respect to candidates for employment in its ordinary course of business;
provided, however, that Buyer shall not require any Permitted Employee to
submit an application as a predicate for being considered for an Offer (though
any such Offer may be conditioned upon Buyer's standard pre-employment
screenings, including background checks). Buyer and its Affiliates may conduct interviews and screening of the Permitted Employees from the Execution
Date until 20 days before the Scheduled Closing Date (such date, which may be
extended in the sole discretion of Seller, the "Offer Period End Date");
provided that such interviewing and screening shall not unreasonably interfere
with the business of Seller or its Affiliates. Seller may supplement Schedule
11.10 at any time within 10 days after the Execution Date in order to add or
remove additional individuals to Schedule 11.10, as determined in Seller's
sole discretion.



(b) Until the Offer Period End Date, Buyer may make Offers of employment to
such Permitted Employees as Buyer determines in its sole discretion, which
Offers (i) shall be conditioned upon the Closing occurring and be effective as
of the Closing Date or, in the case of a Permitted Employee who will be
performing services under the Transition Services Agreement (a "TSA
Employee"), as of the date of the expiration or early termination under the
Transition Services Agreement of the group(s) of services such Permitted
Employee will perform (his or her applicable "TSA Service Termination Date")
and (ii) may be on terms and conditions as Buyer may determine; provided that
each Offer to a Permitted Employee must, unless otherwise agreed by Seller,
not result in a reduction in the Permitted Employee's base salary or base
wages as compared to the base salary or base wages provided by Seller in
writing to Buyer prior to the Execution Date, provided if the base salary or
base wages for a Permitted Employee is not so provided to Buyer prior to the
Execution Date such Permitted Employee's base salary or base wages as offered
by Buyer shall be as Buyer may determine.



(c) Buyer shall, not later than the Offer Period End Date, deliver to Seller a
final written list containing the name, base salary and location of the
principal place of employment of each Permitted Employee to whom Buyer or any
of its Affiliates has made an Offer. In addition, Buyer shall provide to
Seller, not later than 20 days prior to the Scheduled Closing Date, the names
of each Permitted Employee who has then accepted an Offer from Buyer as of
such date or any of its Affiliates (each Permitted Employee who accepts such
an offer being a "Continuing Employee") and the names of the Permitted
Employees who have then declined an Offer from Buyer or its Affiliates (and
shall provide an updated list as of Closing if any additional Permitted
Employees accept or decline such Offer). Each Continuing Employee shall, as of
the Closing Date or, in the case of a TSA Employee, as of their applicable TSA
Services Termination Date (if he or she is still employed by Seller or its
Affiliate), be terminated by Seller or its Affiliate (and Seller shall and
shall cause its Affiliates to release such Continuing Employee from all non-
compete or similar restrictions that would restrict or be violated in any way
by, such Continuing Employee's activities as an employee of Buyer or its
Affiliate) and become an employee of Buyer or its Affiliate.



(d) As of the Closing Date, or in the case of a TSA Employee, as of their
applicable TSA Services Termination Date, each Continuing Employee (and the
covered dependents thereof, as applicable) shall cease participation as active
participants in all Employee Benefit Plans maintained or sponsored by Seller
and its Affiliates. Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall be
responsible for all compensation and benefits for or owing to Continuing
Employees arising on or after their hiring by Buyer or such Affiliate
(including on and after the Closing Date). Seller shall be responsible and pay
for any obligation arising out of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988, and similar state, local and foreign Laws (the "WARN
Act") with respect to any employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including any Permitted Employees laid off on or prior to the Closing Date
or, as applicable, their applicable TSA Services Termination Date); provided
that Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall be responsible and pay for
any obligation arising out of the WARN Act with respect to any Continuing
Employees laid off on or after the commencement of their employment with Buyer
or Affiliates. Nothing herein shall require Buyer to continue to employ any
Continuing Employee for any specified period of time; provided, however, that,
if Seller timely provides to Buyer a list of applicable employees terminated
by Seller in connection with or within 90 days prior to the Closing and, as a
direct result of Buyer's action to terminate or lay off any Continuing
Employee on or after the Closing other than for cause, Seller or any of its Affiliates incur any
Liability under the WARN Act, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller or its
Affiliate, as applicable, for any such Liability.



(e) Buyer hereby agrees not to, and to cause its Affiliates or anyone acting
on its or any of its Affiliates' behalf not to, for a period of two years
after the Execution Date, directly or indirectly (other than as permitted by
Section 11.10(a) and Section 11.10(b) with respect to Permitted Employees):
solicit or contact with a view to the engagement or employment of, any
employee of Seller or its Affiliates; provided, however, that it shall not be
a violation of this Section 11.10(e) to engage in solicitations incidental to
general advertising or other general solicitation in the ordinary course not
specifically targeted at any employee or group of employees of Seller and its
Affiliates or to employ any Person not solicited in violation hereof; and
provided, further, however, that, except pursuant to an Offer extended to a
Permitted Employee prior to the Closing in accordance with Section 11.10(a)
and Section 11.10(b), for a period of six months following the Closing Date,
if Buyer or any of its Affiliates hires or otherwise employs any Permitted
Employee that was terminated or laid off by Seller or its Affiliates and to
which Seller or an Affiliate of Seller made or provided a severance payment or
severance benefits to such employee upon being terminated or laid off, Buyer
shall promptly reimburse Seller or its applicable Affiliate an amount equal to
50% of the severance payment and cost of severance benefits made or provided
to such Permitted Employee (together with 50% of the employer portion of any
employment, payroll or similar Taxes paid by Seller or its Affiliates in
connection therewith).



(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no provision in this
Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary or other right in any
Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) for any reason in
respect of continued employment or new employment with Seller or its
Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates or in respect of any benefits or
compensation that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any plan or
arrangement maintained by Seller or Buyer or their Affiliates. Nothing in this
Section 11.10, express or implied, shall be deemed an amendment of any
Employee Benefit Plan of Buyer or Seller or their Affiliates providing
benefits to any Permitted Employee or any other employee of Seller or its
Affiliates or any other Person.



11.11 Partnership Excluded Assets. Prior to the Scheduled Closing Date, Seller
shall cause the Partnership to convey (whether by assignment, spin-off,
dividend or otherwise) all of its right, title and interest in and to the
Excluded Assets to Seller or Seller's designee (collectively, "Partnership
Excluded Assets").



11.12 Permitting and Drilling Activities.



(a) Prior to Closing, upon the written request of Buyer, Upstream Seller shall
make such filings as reasonably requested by Buyer to obtain, and shall take
such other action as reasonably requested by Buyer or otherwise necessary to
obtain and maintain, Permits with respect to operations for up to ten
refractures and the drilling of up to ten new wells with respect to the
Upstream Assets proposed to be performed by Buyer after the Closing. Buyer
shall prepare all necessary applications and filings and pay all filing fees
with respect to the filing of such applications, and shall pay all out of
pocket expenses incurred by Upstream Seller in performing its obligations
under this Section 11.12(a). Upstream Seller shall not be required to post any
bonds or incur any Liabilities (other than as provide or paid by Buyer) in
performing its obligations under this Section 11.12(a).



(b) Prior to Closing, upon the request of Buyer Upstream Seller shall issue
AFE's to the applicable Persons regarding operations for up to ten refractures
and the drilling of up to ten new wells proposed to be performed with respect
to the Upstream Assets by Buyer following the Closing. Buyer shall prepare
such AFE's and all necessary supplemental information, and the Parties shall
consult with each other with respect to the issuance of such AFE's. To the extent Upstream Seller
receives any prepayments on account of AFEs issued pursuant to this Section
11.12(b), Upstream Seller shall deliver such proceeds to Buyer at Closing (or
promptly after receipt by Upstream Seller thereof if received after Closing)
and there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price on account of such
prepayments or the delivery thereof to Buyer.



(c) Whether or not Closing occurs, Buyer shall (i) promptly upon request by
Seller, reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for all costs and expenses
incurred by such Persons in connection with the cooperation contemplated by
this Section 11.12 (including reasonable legal costs and expenses), and (ii)
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred by such Persons arising from the
cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 11.12 (other than to the extent
such Liabilities arise from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any
Seller Indemnified Party).



11.13 Information Technology. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall be entitled
to erase any and all data, software and other information from any desktop,
laptop, smart phone, tablet or other mobile computing device, network gear,
data center gear and any other information technology equipment held by the
Partnership, in each case, to the extent such data, software or other

collateral required by the Financing effective as of and contingent upon the

upon the Closing, and (g) providing customary available title documents and
information (including title opinions and drilling title opinions).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 11.15, (i)
nothing in this Section 11.15 shall require any such cooperation to the extent
that it would (A) require Seller or its Affiliates (including the Partnership)
or any of their respective Representatives, as applicable, to waive or amend
any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or other fees or
reimburse any expenses prior, or incur any Liability or give any indemnities
or otherwise commit to take any similar action, in each case except, in the
case of the Partnership, but only to the extent that the same is (1) only put in place as of Closing, (2) expressly contingent upon the Closing

period of time prior to the Closing Date, (B) unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing business or operations of Seller or its Affiliates (including the

Liability or obligation of the Partnership under any agreement entered into in
connection with the Financing (other than with respect to customary
authorization letters) shall be effective until the Closing Date. Buyer shall,
promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller and its Affiliates

Seller and its Affiliates (including the Partnership) and each of their
respective Representatives from and against any and all Liabilities suffered

Liabilities arise from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Seller or
its Affiliates (including the Partnership) or any of their respective
Representatives as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction) and any information utilized in connection
therewith; provided however, with respect to the Partnership, such
reimbursement or indemnification shall only be required if this Agreement is

Partnership) or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this
Section 11.15.

Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in connection therewith) with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") a joint petition for temporary waivers
of all applicable capacity release regulations and related policies and
requirements under, and of the related tariff requirements of the interstate
pipelines providing transportation service pursuant to, the Contracts set
forth on Schedule 11.16 (such Contracts, or any renewals, extensions or
replacements thereof, collectively the "Firm Transportation Agreements"), in
each case, as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate transfer from Seller
to Buyer or its designated Affiliate of the Firm Transportation Agreements on
rates, terms and conditions identical to those currently in effect for Seller
prior to the contemplated transfer.

 (b) Upon issuance of an order by FERC granting such waivers, at Closing,
Seller shall assign or permanently release to Buyer or its designated
Affiliate the interests in the Firm Transportation Agreements.



(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 13.4(a) to the contrary, (i) the
Parties shall work cooperatively to obtain, on or prior to the Closing, the
Consent to the (A) assignment to Buyer of, and (B) the permanent release of
Seller from, the Firm Transportation Agreements, in each case, from or by the
counterparties to each Firm Transportation Agreement, and (ii) Buyer shall
satisfy all creditworthiness requirements of each counterparty to the Firm
Transportation Agreements as set forth in such Firm Transportation Agreements
for such purposes, such that Seller shall be relieved from any further
obligation or liability pursuant to the Firm Transportation Agreements from
and after Closing.



(d) If the waivers contemplated above in this Section 11.16 have not been
received from FERC on or prior to the Scheduled Closing Date, the Parties
agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as
either Party deems in good faith to be necessary or desirable to attempt to
expedite FERC's review of the joint petition described in Section 11.16(a) and
the granting by FERC of the waivers sought thereby.



(e) If the waivers contemplated above in this Section 11.16 have not been
received from FERC on or prior to January 25, 2019, the Parties agree to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith to agree on
such alternative arrangements with respect to the Firm Transportation
Agreements as may be reasonably necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and preserve for each Party the benefit of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the Firm
Transportation Agreements (notwithstanding the fact that such waivers have not
been obtained), and should such alternative arrangements be mutually agreed by
the Parties prior to March 1, 2019, each of Buyer and Seller shall thereafter
waive their respective rights to the conditions to Closing set forth in
Section 4.8 and Section 5.8, as applicable.



(f) If the (i) waivers contemplated above in this Section 11.16 have not been
received from FERC, and (ii) the Parties have not been able to come to mutual
agreement on such alternative arrangements described in Section 11.16(e), in
each case, on or prior to March 1, 2019, then (A) without any further action
by the Parties, the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 4.8 and Section
5.8 will be deemed waived by the respective Parties, and (B) from and after
Closing, Buyer and its successors and assigns shall assume, be responsible
for, shall pay on a current basis and hereby defend, indemnify, hold harmless
and forever release the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and
all Liabilities arising from, based upon, related to or associated with the
failure to receive the waivers contemplated above in this Section 11.16,
including any such Liabilities resulting from Seller's retention of the Firm
Transportation Agreements or the transfer of such Firm Transportation
Agreements to Buyer, as applicable.



11.17 Reaffirmation of Mutual Releases. Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (a) each Mutual Release executed and delivered by

such Officer and Manager and (b) to the extent there is any Officer or Manager
after the Execution Date who has not executed and delivered to Buyer as of the
Closing a Mutual Release, each such Officer or Manager to execute and deliver
to Buyer at Closing a Mutual Release.



11.18 Title Insurance. In the event that Buyer elects, in its sole discretion,
to purchase one or more title insurance policies insuring title to any of the
Assets, issued by a title company acceptable to Buyer (the "Title Company"),
Buyer shall pay directly to the Title Company the cost of all title insurance
policy premiums and related rundown, photocopy and other Title Company costs
and charges, and all Uniform Commercial Code search fees and filing fees. Any costs and expenses associated with such
efforts shall be Buyer's sole responsibility. In addition, Buyer may, but
shall not be obligated to, cause to be prepared by one or more surveyors or
engineers acceptable to Buyer, current or updated ALTA/ACSM or state law-
equivalent surveys with respect to such Asset ("Surveys"). Any costs and
expenses associated with any such Surveys shall be Buyer's sole
responsibility. Subject to Section 12.1, and the following sentence, Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection with the procurement of
such Surveys, including providing access to such Asset, in accordance with
Section 12.1, in order to permit Buyer's surveyors and engineers to perform
the work necessary to produce such Surveys. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to execute or deliver any
affidavits (relating to tile, non-imputation or other matters), any evidence
of authority, or any ancillary or other closing documents.



11.19 Control of the Scheduled Concursus Matters; Cooperation Regarding
Conveyed Rights.



(a) Prior to Closing Seller shall (i) through Seller's designated counsel and
at Seller's sole cost and expense, control the defense of the Scheduled
Concursus Matters, provided that Seller shall not settle, compromise, consent
to the entry of any Order with respect thereto or otherwise resolve any
Scheduled Concursus Matters or agree to any amendment or modification to the
ASA JOAs without the prior written consent of Buyer, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (ii) cooperate with Buyer
in preparing to assume the defense, prosecution and/or participation as a
party in the Scheduled Concursus Matters, including providing to Buyer copies
of all pleadings in the Scheduled Concursus Matters and such other information
related to the Conveyed Rights as reasonably requested by Buyer and in
Seller's possession and instructing Seller's counsel in the Scheduled
Concursus Matters to cooperate with Buyer in the defense of the Scheduled
Concursus Matters from and after Closing.



(b) If any of the Scheduled Concursus Matters are not resolved by Final
Resolution as of Closing, from and after Closing Buyer shall, through Buyer's
designated counsel and at Buyer's sole cost and expense, control the defense,
prosecution and/or resolution of such Scheduled Concursus Matters (as to the
Assets subject to the Scheduled Concursus Matters). Buyer shall have the right
to settle, compromise or otherwise resolve such Scheduled Concursus Matters by
Final Resolution at Buyer's sole discretion.



(c) For a period of two (2) years from and after Closing, Seller shall extend
reasonable cooperation to Buyer in connection with the defense, settlement and
resolution of the Scheduled Concursus Matters, including but not limited to
(A) executing such pleadings as requested by Buyer to substitute Buyer for
Seller as a party to the Scheduled Concursus Matters, or consenting to Buyer's
intervention as an additional party thereto, as appropriate; (B) permitting
Seller's existing counsel of record to represent Buyer as a substituted or
additional party if permissible under the ethics rules applicable to such
counsel and the court; (C) making relevant documents and records available to
Buyer without need for subpoena or compulsory process; and (D) making

Seller and Persons under Seller's control in complying with Seller's
obligations in the preceding sentence.



(d) For a period of two (2) years from and after Closing, Seller shall extend

claim with respect the Conveyed Rights, including but not limited to, upon
Buyer's request, making relevant documents and records available to Buyer
without need for subpoena or compulsory process; and making Persons under

for testimony or assistance at conferences, proceedings, hearings, trials or
appeals as may be reasonably requested by Buyer. Buyer shall reimburse Seller
for all documented out of pocket costs incurred by Seller and Persons under Seller's
control in complying with Seller's obligations in the preceding sentence.



11.20 Existing Hedge Contracts.



(a) In addition to the foregoing, at Closing, Seller or its applicable
Affiliate and Buyer shall each execute and deliver to the counterparties to
the Hedge Contracts listed on Schedule 11.20 (the "Existing Hedge Contracts")
novation instruments substantially in the forms attached to this Agreement as
Exhibit K (the "EHC Novation Instruments"). Buyer shall execute an ISDA
agreement with each applicable counterparty of the Existing Hedge Contracts
prior to such novation (to the extent such agreement is needed to effect the
applicable novation) and pay to Seller any fees paid by Seller or its
applicable Affiliate to a counterparty that were necessary to effect any
novation contemplated by this Section 11.20(a). For the avoidance of doubt,
such fees shall not include any amount payable to any counterparty relating to
the mark-to-market value of the Existing Hedge Contracts. Seller shall consult
with Buyer regarding any such fee prior to agreeing to pay such fee. If Seller
or its applicable Affiliate has executed and delivered any EHC Novation
Instrument in accordance with this Section 11.20(a) and the proposed
counterparty thereto or Buyer fails to execute and deliver such EHC Novation
Instrument, Seller shall not be in breach of this Section 11.20(a) for such
counterparty's or Buyer's failure to execute and deliver such EHC Novation
Instrument.



(b) At Closing, the Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased, as
applicable, by the amount the Existing Hedge Contracts, on an aggregate net
basis, have a positive value or a negative value, respectively, to Seller or
its applicable Affiliate, in each case as of the Execution Date (such amount,
the "EHC Aggregate Value"). The EHC Aggregate Value attributable to each
Existing Hedge Contract shall be determined based on the mid-market value with
respect to such Existing Hedge Contract provided by the applicable
counterparty to such Existing Hedge Contract on the Execution Date, and Seller
agrees to request such value attributable to such Existing Hedge Contract from
each such counterparty prior to, but as of, the Execution Date; provided that
if a counterparty does not provide any such amount, or if Seller or Buyer both
believe that any such amount with respect to an Existing Hedge Contract so
provided does not represent a commercially reasonable estimate of the value of
such Existing Hedge Contract as of the Execution Date, then Buyer and Seller
shall, prior to the delivery of the Final Settlement Statement, cooperate to
obtain three mid-market quotations of the value of such Existing Hedge
Contract as of the Closing Date from leading dealers in the relevant hedge
product, and the EHC Aggregate Value with respect to such Existing Hedge
Contract shall be determined based upon the average of the bids received. If
no such bids are received, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to
determine the value of the applicable Existing Hedge Contract as of the
Execution Date prior to the delivery of the Final Settlement Statement.





ARTICLE XII

ACCESS; DISCLAIMERS



12.1 Access.



(a) From and after the Execution Date and up to and including the Defect
Claims Date (or earlier termination of this Agreement), but subject to the
other provisions of this Section 12.1 and obtaining any required consents of
Third Parties, including Third Party operators of the Assets (which consents
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain but shall not be
required to incur any Liabilities with respect thereto), Seller shall, and
shall cause the Partnership to, afford to Buyer and its Representatives
("Buyer's Representatives") reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to (i) the Upstream Assets and Midstream Assets and (ii) all Records in
Seller's or any of its Affiliates' (including the Partnership's) possession. All investigations, due diligence and Survey activities conducted
by Buyer or any Buyer's Representative shall be conducted at Buyer's sole
cost, risk and expense and any conclusions made from any examination done by
Buyer or any Buyer's Representative shall result from Buyer's own independent
review and judgment.



(b) Buyer shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
with respect to the Assets, subject to the other provisions of this Section
12.1 and obtaining any required consents of Third Parties, including Third
Party operators of the Assets (which consents Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain but shall not be required to incur any
Liabilities with respect thereto), but such inspection rights shall be limited
to conducting a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the Upstream Assets
and Midstream Assets and Buyer and the Buyer's Representatives shall not
conduct any Phase II Environmental Site Assessment or operate any equipment or
conduct any testing, boring, sampling, drilling or other invasive
investigation activities (in each case) on or with respect to any of the
Assets without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be
withheld in Seller's sole discretion. Seller may approve Buyer's request to
conduct said Phase II Environmental Site Assessment activities, in whole or in
part, and Buyer shall not have the right to conduct any activities set forth
in such request until such time that Seller has approved such activities in
writing. Seller or its designee shall have the right to accompany Buyer and
Buyer's Representatives whenever they are on site on the Assets (including in
connection with any Survey related activities) and also to collect split test
samples if any are permitted to be collected. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary (including the provisions of this Section 12.1(b)), Buyer
shall not have access to, and shall not be permitted to conduct, any
environmental due diligence (including any Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment or Phase II Environmental Site Assessment) with respect to any
Assets where Seller does not have the authority to grant access for such due
diligence (provided, however, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain permission from any Third Party to allow Buyer and Buyer's
Representatives such access but shall not be required to incur any Liabilities
with respect thereto). If (i) any Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
reflects a reasonable basis for Buyer to conduct Phase II Environmental Site
Assessment activities and (ii) Seller rejects or otherwise declines or fails
to approve Buyer's request to conduct Phase II Environmental Site Assessment
activities proposed by Buyer with respect to any Upstream Asset where Seller
has authority to grant access for such due diligence, then Buyer shall have
the right, exercisable by written notice to Seller on or before the Defect
Claims Date, to exclude from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
such Upstream Asset, and any such excluded Upstream Asset shall be deemed
Excluded Assets hereunder and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by
the aggregate of the Allocated Value thereof pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(iv).



(c) Buyer shall coordinate its environmental property assessments, physical
inspections of the Assets and Survey related activities with Seller and all
Third Party operators to minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the
conduct of business by Seller or such Third Party operators. Buyer shall abide
by Seller's, and any Third Party operator's, safety rules, regulations and
operating policies while conducting its due diligence evaluation of, and
Survey activities relating to, the Assets, including any environmental or
other inspection or assessment of the Assets, and to the extent required by
any Third Party operator, execute and deliver any required bonding or access
agreement of such Third Party operator or provide evidence that Buyer
maintains insurance as may be required by such Third Party operator. Buyer
hereby releases, defends, indemnifies and holds harmless each of the operators
of the Assets and the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
Liabilities (i) for any personal injury, death, loss or damage arising out of
such entry that may occur to Buyer or any Buyer's Representatives arising out
of, resulting from or relating to any field visit, environmental property
assessment, Survey activity, or other due diligence activity conducted by
Buyer or any Buyer's Representative with respect to the Assets or (ii)
reasonably arising out of or resulting from any field visit, environmental
property assessment, Survey activity, or other due diligence activity
conducted by Buyer or any Buyer's Representative with respect to the Assets,
even if such Liabilities arise out of or result from, SOLELY OR IN PART, the sole, active,
passive, concurrent or comparative negligence, strict liability or other fault
or violation of Law of or by a member of THE Seller Indemnified Parties,
excepting only IN THE CASE OF THIS SECTION 12.1(c) Liabilities actually
resulting on the account of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a
member of THE Seller Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that Buyer shall
have no indemnification obligations to the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant
to this Section 12.1(c) for any losses that arise from the identification of
any preexisting Environmental Conditions or noncompliance with Environmental
Laws that are discovered by Buyer or any Buyer's Representative during such
due diligence investigation.



(d) Buyer agrees to promptly provide Seller, no later than the Defect Claims
Date, copies of all (i) Surveys prepared by Buyer and/or any of Buyer's
Representatives if related to any Environmental Defect Property, and (ii)
final environmental reports and environmental test results prepared by Buyer
and/or any of Buyer's Representatives which contain environmental data
collected or generated from Buyer's environmental due diligence with respect
to the Assets and/or Midstream Business (including any drafts thereof). None
of Buyer, any of Buyer's Representatives or Seller shall be deemed by Seller's
receipt of said documents, or otherwise, to have made any representation or
warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to the condition of the Assets
or the Midstream Business or to the accuracy of said documents or the
information contained therein.



(e) Upon completion of Buyer's due diligence and Survey activities, Buyer
shall at its sole cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Seller
or its Affiliates (including the Partnership), (i) repair all damage done to
the Assets (including the real property and other assets associated therewith)
in connection with Buyer's or Buyer's Representatives' due diligence and/or
Survey activities, (ii) restore the Assets (including the real property and
other assets associated therewith) to at least the approximate same or better
condition than they were prior to commencement of Buyer's due diligence and/or
Survey activities and (iii) remove all equipment, tools or other property
brought onto the Assets in connection with Buyer's or Buyer's Representatives'
due diligence and/or Survey activities. Any disturbance to the Assets
(including the leasehold associated therewith) resulting from Buyer's or
Buyer's Representatives' due diligence and/or Survey activities will be
promptly corrected by Buyer.



(f) During all periods a Buyer and/or any Buyer's Representatives are on the
Assets or any lands underlying such Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole
expense, policies of insurance of types and in amounts sufficient to cover the
obligations and Liabilities of such Buyer under Section 12.1(c) and Section
12.1(e). Upon request by Seller, Buyer shall provide evidence of such
insurance to Seller prior to entering the Assets or any lands underlying the
Assets.



12.2 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access
to the Records and the Assets, Buyer will become privy to confidential and
other information of Seller and the Partnership and that such confidential
information shall be held confidential by Buyer and Buyer's Representatives in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. If the Closing
should occur, the foregoing confidentiality restriction on Buyer, including
the Confidentiality Agreement, shall terminate (except as to (a) such portion
of the Upstream Assets that are not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement, (b) the Excluded Assets and (c) information
related to assets other than the Assets).

(b) Special Warranty of Title. The Upstream Assignment and the Deed delivered
at Closing will contain a special warranty of Defensible Title to the Wells
and Well Locations by Upstream Seller, subject, however, to the provisions of
Section 13.1(c) (the "Special Warranty"). 

(c) Recovery on Special Warranties. Buyer shall furnish Upstream Seller a
notice meeting the requirements of Section 13.2(a) setting forth any matters
which Buyer intends to assert as a breach of the Special Warranty contained in
the Upstream Assignment. Upstream Seller shall have a reasonable opportunity,
but not the obligation, to cure any breach of the Special Warranty asserted by
Buyer. Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with any attempt by Upstream
Seller to cure same. For purposes of the Special Warranty contained in the
Upstream Assignment, the value of the Wells and Well Locations set forth in
Schedule 3.7B and Schedule 3.7C, as applicable, shall be deemed to be the
Allocated Value thereof, as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement. Recovery on
the Special Warranty shall be limited to an amount (without any interest
accruing thereon) equal to the reduction in the Purchase Price to which Buyer
would have been entitled had Buyer asserted the defect giving rise to such
breach of the Special Warranty as a Title Defect prior to the Defect Claims
Date pursuant to Section 13.2, excluding and without regard to the application
of the Individual Title Defect Threshold or the Defect Deductible and Buyer
hereby expressly waives any and all other recovery under the Special Warranty
with respect thereto. Buyer is not entitled to protection under Upstream
Seller's Special Warranty, as described above and contained in the Assignment,
against (i) any matter reported by Buyer under Section 13.2(a), (ii) any
matter reported to Upstream Seller after the three-year anniversary of the
Closing Date, and/or (iii) any matter that would not otherwise be a Title
Defect under this Agreement. Seller shall be entitled to offset any amount
owed by Seller for breach of the Special Warranty with respect to any Upstream
Asset by the amount (without duplication of any amounts previously applied as
an offset against any Title Defect Amount or any claim under the Special
Warranty) of any Title Benefits with respect to such Upstream Asset as to
which Seller give Buyer notice after the Defect Claims Date; provided that,
Buyer shall be entitled to object to any such Title Benefit and/or the Title
Benefit Amount of any such Title Benefit and if the Parties cannot agree on
the validity or amount of any such Title Benefit, such matters shall be
resolved in accordance with Section 13.2(j), mutatis mutandis.



13.2 Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments.



(a) Title Defect Notices. Buyer must deliver to Upstream Seller, on or before
5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on December 31, 2018 (the "Defect Claims Date"),
claim notices meeting the requirements of this Section 13.2(a) (collectively
the "Title Defect Notices" and individually a "Title Defect Notice") setting
forth any matters which, in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Title
Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this
Section 13.2. For all purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, but without limiting (x) Buyer's rights under the
Special Warranty (subject to Section 13.1(c)) and (y) Buyer's remedies for
breaches of the covenants of Seller set forth in Section 11.1(b)(ii), Buyer
shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, any
Title Defect that Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by a Title Defect
Notice meeting the requirements of this Section 13.2(a) that is received by
Upstream Seller on or before the Defect Claims Date. To be effective, each
Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a reasonably
identifiable description of the alleged Title Defect and the Well or Well
Location (including a reasonable description of such Well or Well Location,
the Leases(s) contributing to such Well or Well Location, and the affected
Subject Formation(s) with respect to such Well or Well Location), or portions
thereof, affected by such Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (ii)
the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii) the amount by which
Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is
reduced by such Title Defect and Buyer's computations with respect thereto and
(iv) supporting documents reasonably available to Buyer and reasonably
necessary for Upstream Seller to verify the existence of such Title Defect and
Buyer's computations with respect thereto. To give Upstream Seller an
opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to
use reasonable efforts to give Upstream Seller, on or before the end of each
calendar week prior to the Defect Claims Date, written notice of all Title
Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week, which notice
may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Claims Date; provided that, the failure to provide any such notices
of a Title Defect shall not prejudice Buyer's right to assert such Title
Defect hereunder on or before the Defect Claims Date.



(b) Title Benefit Notices. Upstream Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Defect Claims Date with
respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including
(i) a description of the Title Benefit and the Wells (including the legal
description of such Well or Well Location, the Leases(s) contributing to such
Well or Well Location, and the affected Subject Formation(s) with respect to
such Well or Well Location), or portions thereof, affected by such Title
Benefit (each a "Title Benefit Property"), (ii) the amount by which Upstream
Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of such Assets is increased by
the Title Benefit and Upstream Seller's computations with respect thereto and
(iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify the
existence of such Title Benefit and Seller's computations with respect
thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, Seller may not assert any
Title Benefit with respect to any Well or Well Location that is subject to any
Scheduled Concursus Matter.



(c) Upstream Seller's Right to Cure. Upstream Seller shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure, at any time prior
to 120 days after Closing (the "Cure Period"), any Title Defects of which
Upstream Seller has been advised by Buyer. During the period of time from
Closing to the expiration of the Cure Period, Buyer agrees to afford Upstream
Seller and its officers, employees and other authorized Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the Upstream Assets and
all Upstream Records in Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' possession or
control, together with a right to copy such Upstream Records at Upstream
Seller's sole cost, in order to facilitate Upstream Seller's attempt to cure
any such Title Defects. The Purchase Price will be reduced at Closing as
provided in Section 13.2(j) with respect to any Title Defect for which
Upstream Seller has provided notice to Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date
that Upstream Seller intends to attempt to cure during the Cure Period and
that is not cured to Buyer's satisfaction as of Closing and, subject to
Section 13.2(d), the applicable Title Defect Property shall be conveyed to
Buyer at Closing. An election by Upstream Seller to attempt to cure a Title
Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under Section 13.2(j) and
shall not constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Upstream
Seller's right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure,
the alleged Title Defect.



(d) Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to (x) Upstream Seller's continuing
right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect
Amount asserted with respect thereto, (y) Upstream Seller's cure rights
pursuant to Section 13.2(c), and (z) the rights of the Parties pursuant to
Section 7.1(d), in the event that any Title Defect properly asserted by Buyer
in accordance with Section 13.2(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured
on or before the Cure Period, then, subject to the Individual Title Defect
Threshold and the Defect Deductible, then the Parties shall mutually elect to:



(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant
to Section 13.2(g) or Section 13.2(j);



(ii) have Upstream Seller indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from
such Title Defect with respect to the Title Defect Property (up to the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property) pursuant to an indemnity
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parties (each,
a "Title Indemnity Agreement"); or



(iii) exclude the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to
such Title Defect, together with all associated Upstream Assets to the extent
required to produce Hydrocarbons from such Title Defect Property, from the
Upstream Assets in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and
associated Upstream Assets and such Title Defect Property and the associated
Upstream Assets shall be treated as Excluded Assets under this Agreement.



In the event that the Parties do not agree in writing by the Closing on an
election of alternative (i), (ii) or (iii) above with respect to any Title
Defect, the Parties shall be deemed to have elected alternative (i) with
respect to such Title Defect, subject to Section 13.2(j); provided that if the
Title Defect Amount associated with any Title Defect Property as asserted by
Buyer (after giving effect to any reduction thereof as agreed to by Buyer or
determined by the Title Arbitrator, if applicable, due to efforts by Seller
prior to Closing to cure such Title Defect) equals or exceeds 100% of the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, then Upstream Seller may elect
alternative (iii) with respect to such Title Defect Property.



(e) Remedies for Title Benefits. With respect to each Title Benefit Property
reported under Section 13.2(b), the aggregate Title Defect Amounts
attributable to all Title Defects properly raised pursuant to Section 13.2(a)
and uncured shall be decreased by an amount (the "Title Benefit Amount") equal
to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Title Benefit Property caused
by such Title Benefit, as determined pursuant to Section 13.2(h) or Section
13.2(j), and Seller shall not be entitled to any remedy with respect to any
Title Benefit Amounts in excess of the aggregate Title Defect Amounts raised
hereunder.



(f) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's (i) rights under the Special
Warranty, subject to the provisions of Section 13.1(c), (ii) rights to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d), (iii) rights under
Section 8.2(a) (as related to the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in Section 9.20) and (iv) rights under Section 8.2(b) (as related to the
covenants of Seller set forth in Section 11.1(b)(ii)) and Section 8.2(d) (as
related to the Retained Litigation), the provisions set forth in Section
13.2(d) shall be the sole and exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect
to Upstream Seller's failure to have Defensible Title or any other title
matter with respect to any Upstream Asset.



(g) Title Defect Amount. The amount by which the Allocated Value of the
affected Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a
Title Defect shall be the "Title Defect Amount" and shall be determined in
accordance with the following terms and conditions:



(i) if Buyer and Upstream Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that
amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;



(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property; provided that
if such Encumbrance affects more than one Title Defect Property, the Title
Defect Amount shall be the aggregate amount necessary to be paid to remove the
Title Defect from all such Title Defect Properties (and not counted in
duplicate as to each Title Defect Property);



(iii) if (I) the Title Defect represents a negative discrepancy between (A)
Upstream Seller's Net Revenue Interest for the Subject Formation of any Well
or Well Location and (B) Upstream Seller's Net Revenue Interest for the
Subject Formation of such Well or Well Location as set forth in Exhibit B-1 or
Exhibit B-2, as applicable, and (II) Upstream Seller's Working Interest in
such Well or Well Location is proportionately decreased from the amount as set
forth on Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2, as applicable, then the Title Defect
Amount shall be the product of (1) the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property, multiplied by (2) a fraction, the (x) numerator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest decrease for the applicable Subject Formation of such Well or
Well Location, and (y) denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest for
the applicable Subject Formation of such Well or Well Location as set forth in
Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2; 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Upstream
Seller and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation; provided, however, that if such Title Defect is reasonably capable
of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the
reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect;



(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder;



(vi) if a Title Defect does not affect a Title Defect Property throughout the
entire remaining productive life of such Title Defect Property, such fact
shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Amount; and



(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article XIII, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any single Title Defect Property (whether related to an
adjustment to the Purchase Price or any other remedy provided by Seller
hereunder or any claim for any breach of the Special Warranty) shall not
exceed the lesser of: (A) the actual cost and expense of curing such Title
Defect (if such Title Defect is actually capable of being cured) and (B) the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property; provided that this Section
13.2(i)(vii) shall not apply to limit the Title Defect Amount with respect to
any Title Defect as described in Section 13.2(g)(ii).



(h) Title Benefit Amount. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:



(i) if Buyer and Upstream Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that
amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;



(ii) if (I) the Title Benefit represents a positive discrepancy between (A)
Upstream Seller's Net Revenue Interest for the Subject Formation of any Well
or Well Location, and (B) Upstream Seller's Net Revenue Interest for the
Subject Formation of such Well or Well Location as set forth in Exhibit B-1 or
Exhibit B-2, as applicable, and (II) Upstream Seller's Working Interest in
such Well or Well Location is proportionately increased from the amount as set
forth on Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2, as applicable, then the Title Benefit
Amount shall be the product of (1) the Allocated Value of the affected Well or
Well Location, as applicable, multiplied by (2) a fraction, the (x) numerator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase for the applicable Subject
Formation of such Well or Well Location, as applicable, and (y) denominator of
which is the Net Revenue Interest for the applicable Subject Formation of such
Well or Well Location as set forth in Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2, as
applicable; and



(iii) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of the Upstream Asset affected by such Title Benefit, the portion of such
Upstream Asset affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title
Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of
such Asset, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Upstream
Seller and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

 (i) Threshold and Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in
no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the
Title Defect Amount does not exceed $75,000 ("Individual Title Defect
Threshold"), provided that if a Title Defect (or the facts or circumstances
resulting in or giving rise to a Title Defect) is applicable to or affects
multiple Title Defect Properties, the Title Defect Amount for each affected
Title Defect Property shall be aggregated for purposes of determining if the
Individual Title Defect Threshold is met; and (ii) in no event shall there be
any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for
any Title Defect that exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold unless (A)
the sum of (1) the Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed
the Individual Title Defect Threshold (excluding any Title Defects cured by
Seller or retained by Seller pursuant to Section 13.2(d)(iii)), plus (2) all
Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Defect Threshold (excluding any Environmental Defects Remediated
by Seller or retained by Seller pursuant to Section 14.1(c)(iii)), minus (3)
all Title Benefit Amounts, exceeds (B) the Defect Deductible, after which
point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies only with respect to Title Defects relating to Title Defect Amounts
in excess of such Defect Deductible. For avoidance of doubt, the Individual
Title Defect Threshold is a threshold and shall not be applied as a deductible
if the Individual Title Defect Threshold is exceeded by the applicable Title
Defect Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, if Seller indemnifies Buyer with
respect to any Title Defect Property pursuant to a Title Indemnity Agreement
or retains any Title Defect Property pursuant to Section 13.2(d)(iii), then,
in each case the Title Defect Amount related to such Title Defect Property
will not be counted towards the Defect Deductible. This Section 13.2(i) shall
be applied in this Agreement without giving duplicative effect to its
application under this Section 13.2 and Section 14.1.



(j) Title Dispute Resolution/Escrow.



(i) Upstream Seller and Buyer shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts
to agree on (A) all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and
Title Benefit Amounts prior to Closing and (B) whether or not any Title Defect
that Upstream Seller elects to cure pursuant to Section 13.2(c) has been cured
(or if not so cured the Title Defect and/or Title Defect Amount applicable
thereto) by the expiration of the Cure Period (each such matter to which the
Parties do not agree, a "Title Dispute"). If Upstream Seller and Buyer are so
unable to agree by the Closing Date on any Title Dispute (including any
efforts by Seller prior to the Closing to cure any Title Defect), or if any
Title Defect that Upstream Seller elects to cure pursuant to Section 13.2(c)
has been not cured to Buyer's satisfaction as of the Closing Date, then, in
either such case, (1) such Title Dispute shall be exclusively and finally
resolved pursuant to this Section 13.2(j), subject to the proviso of Section
4.4 and Seller's continuing right to cure the Title Defect giving rise to such
Title Dispute until the expiration of the Cure Period, (2) an amount equal to
the sum of (x) if the Parties had elected (or were deemed to have elected) the
remedies set forth in Section 13.2(d)(i) or Section 13.2(d)(ii) with respect
to the applicable Title Defect, the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in
good faith in the applicable Title Defect Notice applicable to such Title
Defect, and (y) if the Parties (or Upstream Seller, as permitted under Section
13.2(d)) had elected the remedy set forth in Section 13.2(d)(iii) with respect
to the applicable Title Defect, the Allocated Value of the Upstream Assets
subject to such Title Dispute, as limited by Section 13.2(i) (such amount, as
determined in the aggregate with respect to all applicable Title Disputes, the
"Closing Date Title Escrow Amount") will be deposited by Buyer with the Escrow
Agent to be held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and Section 13.2(j)(iv) and
(3) the Purchase Price will be reduced at the Closing by the Closing Date
Title Escrow Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, unless the Parties elect (or
Upstream Seller, as permitted under Section 13.2(d)) elects) the remedy set
forth in Section 13.2(d)(iii) with respect to any Title Dispute, in which case
such Upstream Assets shall be retained by Upstream Seller at Closing, the
Upstream Assets subject to any such Title Dispute shall be conveyed to Buyer
at Closing pursuant to the Assignment.

 (ii) There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at
least ten years' experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the
regional area in which the Title Defect Properties are located, as selected by
mutual agreement of Buyer and Upstream Seller within 15 days after the end of
the Cure Period (the "Title Arbitrator"). In the event the Parties are unable
to mutually agree upon the Title Arbitrator within such time period, then
either Party may petition the AAA to select a neutral party who has never been
an officer, director or employee of or performed material work for the Parties
or any of their Affiliates within the preceding five year period as Title
Arbitrator, with due regard given to the selection criteria above and input
from the Parties. In the event the AAA should fail to select the Title
Arbitrator within 90 days from initiation of arbitration, then either party to
the Title Dispute may petition any United States District Judge for the
District of Colorado to select the Title Arbitrator. The arbitration
proceeding shall be held in Denver, Colorado.



(iii) Within ten Business Days after the selection of the applicable Title
Arbitrator, the Parties shall provide to such Title Arbitrator the documents
and materials described in this Section 13.2(j)(iii), as applicable: (A) each
Title Defect Notice and all documentation provided therewith with respect to
each disputed Title Defect; (B) each Title Benefit Notice and all
documentation provided therewith with respect to each disputed Title Benefit;
(C) such evidence as Upstream Seller deems appropriate to explain and dispute
the existence, waiver and cure of each disputed Title Defect or the Title
Defect Amount assigned thereto by Buyer in any Title Defect Notice, together
with Upstream Seller's good faith estimate of the Title Defect Amount, if any,
with respect to each such disputed Title Defect; and (D) such evidence as
Buyer deems appropriate to dispute the existence of any disputed Title Benefit
or the Title Benefit Amount assigned thereto in any Title Benefit Notice with
respect any such disputed Title Benefit, together with Buyer's good faith
estimate of the disputed Title Benefit Amount, if any, with respect to each
such disputed Title Benefit. Each of Buyer and Seller also shall furnish to
the Title Arbitrator such workpapers and other documents and information
relating to each Title Dispute as the Title Arbitrator may request and are
available to that Party or its Affiliates, and each of Buyer and Seller will
be afforded the opportunity to present to the Title Arbitrator any material
relating to each Title Dispute as such Party shall deem appropriate to support
its position with respect to each such matter and to discuss such
determination with the Title Arbitrator prior to any written notice of
determination hereunder being delivered by the Title Arbitrator.



(iv) The Title Arbitrator's determination shall be in writing and shall be
made within 20 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be
final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in
Section 13.2(g) and Section 13.2(h) and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider only those materials described in Section 13.2(j)(iii), and shall
choose either Upstream Seller's position or Buyer's position with respect to
each matter addressed in a Title Dispute, based on the materials described
above. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Title Defect, Title Benefit, Title Defect
Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts, and/or curative efforts submitted by either
Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with
respect to any matter. Upstream Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal
fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of Upstream Seller and Buyer
shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.



(v) Upon the later of the Title Arbitrator's determination of all Title
Disputes submitted to the Title Arbitrator for determination or the Parties'
agreement as to the resolution of such Title Dispute and the Environmental
Arbitrator's determination of all Environmental Disputes submitted to the
Environmental Arbitrator for determination or the Parties' agreement as to the
resolution of such Environmental Disputes, then, with respect to the Title
Defect Property subject to such Title Dispute, if (A) the Parties had elected
(or were deemed to have elected) the remedy in Section 13.2(d)(i), then within
ten Business Days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer
and Upstream Seller of its award with respect thereto (or the Parties otherwise agree as to the resolution of
such Title Dispute), and subject to Section 13.2(i), Buyer and Upstream Seller
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver out of
the applicable Closing Date Title Escrow Amount (1) to Upstream Seller the
amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Upstream Seller with
respect to such Title Dispute (or as agreed by the Parties with respect
thereto) and (2) to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title
Arbitrator to Buyer with respect to such Title Dispute (or as agreed by the
Parties with respect thereto), (B) the Parties had elected the remedy in
Section 13.2(d)(ii), then the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to enter into the applicable Title Indemnity Agreement within ten
Business Days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and
Upstream Seller of his decision with respect thereto (or the Parties otherwise
agree as to the resolution of such Title Dispute) and upon execution of such
Title Indemnity Agreement Buyer and Upstream Seller shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver out of the Closing Date
Title Escrow Amount to Upstream Seller an amount equal to the Allocated Value
of the applicable Title Defect Property the Title Defect Amount claimed by
Buyer in good faith in the applicable Title Defect Notice applicable to such
Title Defect, or (C) the Parties (or Upstream Seller, as permitted under
Section 13.2(d)) had elected the remedy in Section 13.2(d)(iii), then within
ten Business days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer
and Upstream Seller of his decision with respect thereto (or the Parties
otherwise agree as to the resolution of such Title Dispute), the Parties (or
Upstream Seller, as permitted under Section 13.2(d), as applicable) shall once
against elect between the remedies in Section 13.2(d) pursuant to the terms
thereof, mutatis mutandis, and (1) clause (A) or (B) of this Section
13.2(j)(v) shall apply, as applicable, or (2) if Section 13.2(d)(iii) is
applicable with respect to such Title Defect Property, Buyer and Upstream
Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver
out of the Closing Date Title Escrow Amount to Buyer an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of the applicable Title Defect Property and Seller shall
continue to retain the applicable Title Defect Property and associated
Upstream Assets. Disbursements from the Environmental Escrow Amount pursuant
to this Section 13.2(j)(v) shall be made giving effect to Section 13.2(j)(ii)
and Section 14.1(e)(ii) so as to achieve the same result as if the matters
submitted to the Environmental Arbitrator for determination and to the Title
Arbitrator for determination had been resolved prior to Closing on the same
basis as resolved pursuant to this Section 13.2(j) and Section 14.1(f).



(vi) Except as provided in the proviso of Section 4.4, nothing herein shall
operate to cause the Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration
hereunder and to the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties
as of the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted therefor as of the
Closing by the Closing Date Title Escrow Amount as provided in this Section
13.2(j) and subsequent adjustments thereto will be made pursuant to Section
3.5 and this Section 13.2.



13.3 Casualty Loss.



(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to (i) production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any Well)
and (ii) the depreciation of personal property due to ordinary wear and tear,
in each case, with respect to the Assets.



(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, subject to
Section 13.3(c), any portion of the Assets is damaged or destroyed or
otherwise impaired by fire, explosion, tornado, hurricane, earthquake, earth
movement, flood, water damage or other similar casualty or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain (in each case, a "Casualty
Loss"), then Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and Seller shall elect by written notice to
Buyer prior to Closing either to (i) cause the Assets affected by such
Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to at least its condition prior to
such Casualty Loss, at Seller's sole cost, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date) or (ii) pay to Buyer all sums
paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason of such Casualty Loss affecting the
Assets and assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to (in
the case of any such rights held by Seller outside of the Partnership) all of
Seller's right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards
and other rights against Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than
insurance claims, of or against any Seller Indemnified Parties) arising out of
such Casualty Loss affecting the Assets; provided, however, that if the
Casualty Loss affected the Upstream Assets, Seller shall reserve and retain
(and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all rights, title, interests and claims
against Third Parties for the recovery of Seller's costs and expenses incurred
prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such insurance claims or
other rights against Third Parties with respect to any such Casualty Loss. If
Seller elects the option in item (i) above, Seller shall retain (or, if such
rights are held by the Partnership, Seller and Buyer shall cause the
Partnership to assign to Seller) all rights to insurance, condemnation awards
and other claims against Third Parties with respect to the casualty or taking
except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.



(c) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, (i) all or any
portion of the Gas Plants are destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion,
tornado, hurricane, earthquake, earth movement, flood, water damage, sabotage,
accident or other casualty (all of which are herein called "Midstream Casualty
Loss"), (ii) the Gas Plants (or portions thereof) affected thereby have not,
prior to the Closing Date, been replaced or repaired in all material respects
to the condition of such Midstream Assets immediately prior to such Midstream
Casualty Loss and placed into such operational condition and capability as
such Midstream Assets were in immediately prior to such Midstream Casualty
Loss, and (iii) such Midstream Casualty Loss could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the ability of Buyer and the Partnership
following the Closing to operate the Midstream Business in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice for a period that is longer than 120
days after the Closing, then Buyer may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(f).



(d) Seller shall give Buyer prompt notice of any Casualty Loss or Midstream
Casualty Loss of which Seller becomes aware. Seller shall not voluntarily
compromise, settle or adjust any amounts payable by reason of any Casualty
Loss or Midstream Casualty Loss without first obtaining the written consent of
Buyer, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



13.4 Consents; Preferential Rights.



(a) Seller, on or prior to the later of (x) ten Business Days after the
Execution Date, and (y) five Business Days after the Assignment Drop Dead
Date, shall send to each holder of a Consent set forth in Schedule 9.4 a
notice seeking such holder's consent to the transactions contemplated hereby.
With respect to any Consent that is not set forth on Schedule 9.4 (including
those Consents not required to be set forth on such Schedule) but is
discovered by any Party prior to Closing, Seller shall send to the holder of
each such Consent a notice seeking such holder's consent to the transactions
contemplated hereby as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of such
Consent. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
Consents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (provided that Seller shall
not be obligated to incur any Liability to obtain any such Consent), and Buyer
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with any such
efforts (provided that Buyer shall not be obligated to incur any Liability
(other than, as of the Closing, the Upstream Assumed Obligations) to obtain
any such Consent; provided, further, however, that such restriction shall not
be viewed to limit Buyer's obligation to post any credit support or other
similar consideration that may be expressly contemplated and/or called for
pursuant to the terms of any Applicable Contract, Lease or Upstream Easement,
including the Firm Transportation Agreements).

 (i) If Seller fails to obtain a Hard Consent, then, in each such case, the
affected Upstream Asset(s) shall be excluded from the Upstream Assets to be
acquired by Buyer at Closing hereunder, and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of the Upstream Asset(s) so excluded. Following
Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each
such Hard Consent (provided that Seller shall not be obligated to incur any
Liabilities to obtain any such Consent). In the event that a Hard Consent
(with respect to any applicable Upstream Asset(s) excluded pursuant to this
Section 13.4(a)(i)) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained within
180 days following Closing, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of such fact,
and Buyer shall purchase, within ten days after such notification, such
Upstream Asset(s) so excluded from Upstream Seller under the terms of this
Agreement for the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing
due to the exclusion of such Upstream Asset(s) (as such amount is
appropriately adjusted in accordance to Section 3.3 with respect to such
Upstream Asset(s)), and Upstream Seller shall assign to Buyer such Upstream
Asset(s) pursuant to an assignment in form substantially similar to the
Upstream Assignment.



(ii) If Seller fails to obtain a Consent other than a Hard Consent prior to
the Closing, then (x) the Upstream Asset(s) subject to such un-obtained
Consent shall nevertheless be acquired by Buyer at Closing as part of the
Upstream Assets or indirectly through the acquisition of the Midstream
Interests, (y) Buyer shall have no claim against, and hereby releases and
indemnifies the Seller Indemnified Parties from any Liability for, the failure
to obtain such Consent, and (z) Buyer shall be solely responsible from and
after the Closing for any and all Liabilities arising from the failure to
obtain such Consent as part of the Upstream Assumed Obligations hereunder.



(b) With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right set forth on Schedule
9.4, Seller, on or prior to the later of (x) ten Business Days after the
Execution Date, and (y) five Business Days after the Assignment Drop Dead
Date, shall send to the holder of each such Preferential Purchase Right a
notice in compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such
Preferential Purchase Right requesting a waiver of such right. With respect to
each Preferential Purchase Right that is not set forth on Schedule 9.4 but is
discovered by any Party prior to Closing, Seller shall send to the holder of
each such Preferential Purchase Right a notice in compliance with the
contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right
requesting a waiver of such right as soon as reasonably practicable after
discovery of any such Preferential Purchase Right. Any Preferential Purchase
Right must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and the consideration payable under this Agreement for the purposes
of all Preferential Purchase Right notices shall be the Allocated Value of the
applicable Upstream Asset (as adjusted herein).



(i) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right has
consummated the acquisition of the Upstream Assets to which its Preferential
Purchase Right applies, then the Upstream Assets subject to such Preferential
Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Upstream Assets to be assigned to
Buyer at Closing (and shall be considered Excluded Assets hereunder, but only
to the extent of the portions of such Upstream Assets affected by the
Preferential Purchase Right), and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such Upstream Assets (or portions thereof) so excluded.
Seller shall be entitled to all consideration given by any Person consummating
the acquisition of any Upstream Assets subject to any Preferential Purchase
Right prior to Closing.



(ii) If, as of Closing, (A) any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right has
not waived such Preferential Purchase Right, (B) the period to exercise such
Preferential Purchase Right has not expired without exercise or waiver
thereof, or (C) any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right has not
consummated the acquisition of the Upstream Assets to which its Preferential
Purchase Right applies, then, in each case, the Upstream Assets subject to
such Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Upstream Assets to
be assigned to Buyer at Closing (and shall be considered Excluded Assets
hereunder, but only to the extent of the portions of such Upstream Assets affected by the Preferential Purchase
Right), and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
Upstream Assets (or portions thereof) so excluded.



(iii) If, following the Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right
with respect to assets excluded from the Upstream Assets to be assigned to
Buyer pursuant to Section 13.4(b)(ii) fails to validly exercise such right
prior to the expiration of the exercise period applicable to such Preferential
Purchase Right or fails to consummate the acquisition of the Upstream Assets
to which such holder's Preferential Purchase Right was exercised (prior to or
after the Closing), Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of such failure, and
Buyer shall purchase, within ten days after such notification, such Upstream
Asset(s) so excluded from Upstream Seller under the terms of this Agreement
for the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing due to the
exclusion of such Upstream Asset(s) (as such amount is appropriately adjusted
in accordance to Section 3.3 with respect to such Upstream Asset(s)), and
Upstream Seller shall assign to Buyer such Upstream Asset(s) pursuant to an
assignment in form substantially similar to the Upstream Assignment and
deliver any other instruments and documents that would have been required
under the terms of this Agreement to be delivered at the Closing with respect
to such Upstream Asset(s).



ARTICLE XIV

ENVRIONMENTAL MATTERS



14.1 Notice of Environmental Defects.



(a) Environmental Defect Notices. If Buyer discovers any Environmental
Condition which, in its reasonable opinion, Buyer determines constitutes an
Environmental Defect, Buyer shall promptly notify Upstream Seller within five
Business Days of such discovery and, in any event, on or before the Defect
Claims Date. To be effective, notice of an Environmental Defect (an
"Environmental Defect Notice") shall be in writing and shall include (i) a
reasonable description of the Environmental Condition constituting, in Buyer's
reasonable opinion, Environmental Defect(s), (ii) the identity of the Upstream
Asset(s) (including, with respect to a Well or Well Location, a reasonable
description of such Well or Well Location and the Leases(s) contributing to
such Well or Well Location) or portions thereof, affected by the asserted
Environmental Defect (each, an "Environmental Defect Property"), (iii)
supporting documentation available to Buyer reasonably necessary for Seller to
verify the existence of the alleged Environmental Defect, including, to the
extent permitted by Seller under Section 12.1, any physical measurements or
lab analyses or photographs, (iv) the Allocated Value of each Environmental
Defect Property, (v) the Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail)
that Buyer asserts is attributable to such Environmental Defect and the
computations and information upon which Buyer's belief is based, (vi) a
reasonable description of the Remediation proposed for the Environmental
Condition that gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect, and (vii) a
reasonable description of the violation of Environmental Law that gives rise
to such Environmental Defect. For all purposes of this Agreement but subject
to Buyer's remedy for a breach of Seller's representation contained in Section
9.14 and Buyer's remedies for breaches of the covenants of Seller set forth in
Section 11.1(a)(i) (as so limited by Section 11.1(c)), Buyer shall be deemed
to have waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, any Environmental
Defect which Buyer fails to assert as an Environmental Defect by an
Environmental Defect Notice meeting the requirements of this Section 14.1(a)
that is received by Upstream Seller on or before the Defect Claims Date.



(b) Upstream Seller's Right to Remediate. Upstream Seller shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to Remediate, at
any time prior to the Closing, any Environmental Defects of which Upstream
Seller has been advised by Buyer. An election by Upstream Seller to Remediate
an Environmental Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under Section
14.1(f) and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Upstream Seller's right to
dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to Remediate, the alleged
Environmental Defect.



(c) Remedies for Environmental Defects. Subject to (x) Upstream Seller's
continuing right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or
the Remediation Amount asserted with respect thereto, (y) Upstream Seller's
remediation rights pursuant to Section 14.1(b), and (z) the rights of the
Parties pursuant to Section 7.1(d), in the event that any Environmental Defect
properly asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 14.1(a) is not waived in
writing by Buyer or Remediated on or before the Closing, then, subject to the
Individual Environmental Defect Threshold and the Defect Deductible, the
Parties shall mutually agree to resolve Environmental Defects as follows:



(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount determined pursuant to
Section 14.1(f) or other provision of this Agreement;



(ii) Upstream Seller shall retain responsibility for the Remediation of such
Environmental Defect and Upstream Seller shall indemnify Buyer against all
Liability resulting from such Environmental Defect pursuant to an indemnity
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parties (each,
an "Environmental Indemnity Agreement");



(iii) Upstream Seller shall retain the entirety of such Environmental Defect
Property and all associated Upstream Assets, in which event the Purchase Price
shall be reduced at Closing by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Property and such associated Upstream Assets, and such
Environmental Defect Property and associated Upstream Assets shall be treated
as Excluded Assets under this Agreement; or



(iv) Buyer shall assume the responsibility for the Remediation of the
Environmental Defect, and Upstream Seller shall indemnify Buyer against all
Liability resulting from such Environmental Defect up to the Allocated Value
of the applicable Environmental Defect Property pursuant to an Environmental
Indemnity Agreement;



In the event that the Parties do not agree in writing by Closing on an
election of alternative (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above with respect to any
Environmental Defect, the Parties shall be deemed to have elected alternative
(i) with respect to such Environmental Defect, subject to Section 14.1(f);
provided that if the Remediation Amount associated with an Environmental
Defect Property as asserted by Buyer (after giving effect to any reduction
thereof as agreed to by Buyer due to efforts by Seller prior to Closing to
cure such Environmental Defect) equals or exceeds the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Property, then Upstream Seller may elect alternative
(iii) with respect to such Environmental Defect Property.



If the Parties elect (or are deemed to have elected) alternative (i) above,
Buyer shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs and
expenses attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental Condition
attributable to such Environmental Defect and such responsibility of Buyer
shall be deemed to constitute part of the Upstream Assumed Obligations
hereunder. If the Parties elect alternative (ii) above, Upstream Seller shall
use reasonable efforts to implement such Remediation in a manner which is
consistent with the requirements of Environmental Laws in a timely fashion for
the type of Remediation that Seller elects to undertake and Buyer, effective
as of the Closing, grants to Seller and its Representatives, access to the
Upstream Assets and all utilities located on the Upstream Assets as may be
reasonably required in order to conduct such Remediation.

 (d) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's rights (i) under Section 8.2(a) for a
breach of Seller's representations and warranties set forth in Section 9.14,
(ii) under Section 8.2(b) for a breach of the covenants of Seller set forth in
Section 11.1(a)(i) and (iii) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(d), the provisions set forth in Section 14.1(c) shall be the exclusive
right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental Defect or any
other environmental matter with respect to any Asset.



(e) Threshold and Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in
no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any individual Environmental Defect for which
the Remediation Amount does not exceed $100,000 ("Individual Environmental
Defect Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Environmental
Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental
Defect Threshold unless (A) the sum of (1) the Remediation Amounts of all such
Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Defect
Threshold (excluding any Environmental Defects Remediated by Upstream Seller
or retained by Upstream Seller pursuant to Section 14.1(c)(iii))), plus (2)
all Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title
Defect Threshold (excluding any Title Defects cured by Upstream Seller or
retained by Upstream Seller pursuant to Section 13.2(d)(iii))), minus (3) all
Title Benefit Amounts, exceeds (B) the Defect Deductible, after which point
Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
only with respect to such Environmental Defects relating to Remediation
Amounts in excess of the Defect Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Individual Environmental Defect Threshold is a threshold and shall not be
applied as a deductible if the amount of such Individual Environmental Defect
Threshold is exceeded by the applicable Remediation Amount. For the avoidance
of doubt, if Upstream Seller indemnifies Buyer with respect to any
Environmental Defect Property pursuant to an Environmental Indemnity Agreement
or retains any Environmental Defect Property pursuant to Section 14.1(c)(iii),
then, in each case, after such election, the Remediation Amount relating to
such Environmental Defect Property will not be counted towards the Defect
Deductible. This Section 14.1(e) shall be applied in this Agreement without
giving duplicative effect to its application under this Section 14.1 and
Section 13.2.



(f) Environmental Dispute Resolution.



(i) Upstream Seller and Buyer shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts
to agree (A) to all Environmental Defect and Remediation Amounts prior to
Closing and (B) whether or not any Environmental Defect that Upstream Seller
elects to Remediate prior to Closing pursuant to Section 14.1(b) has been
Remediated (or if not so cured the Remediation Amount applicable thereto) by
the Closing (each such matter to which the Parties do not agree, an
"Environmental Dispute"). If Upstream Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by
the Closing Date on any Environmental Dispute (including any efforts by Seller
prior to Closing to Remediate any Environmental Defect), then (1) such
Environmental Dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration
pursuant to this Section 14.1(f), subject to the proviso of Section 4.4, (2)
an amount equal to the sum of (x) if the Parties had elected (or were deemed
to have elected) the remedies set forth in Section 14.1(c)(i), Section
14.1(c)(ii), or Section 14.1(c)(iv) with respect to the applicable
Environmental Defect, the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in good faith in
the applicable Environmental Defect Notice applicable to such Environmental
Dispute, and (y) if the Parties (or Upstream Seller, as permitted under
Section 14.1(c)) had elected the remedy set forth in Section 14.1(c)(iii) with
respect to the applicable Environmental Defect, the Allocated Value of the
Upstream Assets subject to such Environmental Dispute, subject to Section
14.1(e) (such amount, as determined in the aggregate with respect to all
applicable Environmental Disputes, the "Closing Date Environmental Escrow
Amount") will be deposited by Buyer with the Escrow Agent to be held pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement and Section 14.1(f)(v) and (3) the Purchase Price will
be reduced at Closing by the Closing Date Environmental Escrow Amount. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Upstream Assets subject to any Environmental Dispute
shall be conveyed to Buyer at Closing pursuant to the Assignment unless (X) the Parties
(or Upstream Seller, as permitted under Section 14.1(c)) elect the remedy set
forth in Section 14.1(c)(iii) with respect to any Environmental Dispute or (Y)
the Remediation Amount asserted by Buyer in the applicable Environmental
Defect Notice applicable to such Environmental Dispute equals or exceeds the
Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property such that the Parties
(or Upstream Seller, as permitted under Section 14.1(c)) may, upon final
determination of the Environmental Dispute, elect the remedy set forth in
Section 14.1(c)(iii) with respect to such Environmental Dispute if, as
determined by the Environmental Arbitrator, the Remediation Amount equals or
exceeds the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property, in either
case of (X) or (Y), such Upstream Assets shall be retained by Upstream Seller
at Closing.



(ii) There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental
consultant with at least ten years' experience in environmental matters
involving oil and gas producing properties in the regional area in which the
affected Upstream Assets are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer
and Upstream Seller within 15 days after the Closing Date (the "Environmental
Arbitrator"). In the event the Parties are unable to mutually agree upon the
Environmental Arbitrator within such time period, then either Party may
petition the AAA to select a neutral party who has never been an officer,
director or employee of or performed material work for the Parties or any of
their Affiliates within the preceding five year period as Environmental
Arbitrator, with due regard given to the selection criteria above and input
from the Parties. In the event the AAA should fail to select the Environmental
Arbitrator within 90 days from initiation of arbitration, then either party to
the Environmental Dispute may petition any United States District Judge for
the District of Colorado to select the Environmental Arbitrator. The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Denver, Colorado.



(iii) Within ten Business Days after the selection of the applicable
Environmental Arbitrator, the Parties shall provide to such Environmental
Arbitrator (A) each Environmental Defect Notice and all documentation provided
therewith with respect to each disputed Environmental Defect; and (B) such
evidence as Seller deems appropriate to explain and dispute the existence,
waiver and cure of each disputed Environmental Defect or the Remediation
Amount assigned thereto by Buyer in any Environmental Defect Notice, together
with Seller's good faith estimate of the Remediation Amount, if any, with
respect to each such disputed Environmental Defect. Each of Buyer and Seller
also shall furnish to the Environmental Arbitrator such workpapers and other
documents and information relating to each Environmental Dispute as the
Environmental Arbitrator may request and are available to that Party or its
Affiliates, and each of buyer and Seller will be afforded the opportunity to
present to the Environmental Arbitrator any material relating to each
Environmental Dispute as such Party shall deem appropriate to support its
position with respect to each such matter and to discuss such determination
with the Environmental Arbitrator prior to any written notice of determination
hereunder being delivered by the Environmental Arbitrator.



(iv) The Environmental Arbitrator's determination shall be in writing and
shall be made within 20 days after submission of the matters in dispute and
shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In
making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the
rules set forth in this Section 14.1 and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider only those materials described in Section 14.1(f)(iii), and shall
choose either Upstream Seller's position or Buyer's position with respect to
each matter addressed in an Environmental Dispute, based on the materials
described above. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects,
Remediation Amounts, and/or curative efforts submitted by either Party and may
not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any
matter. Upstream Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case. Each of Upstream Seller and Buyer shall bear
one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator.

 (v) Upon the later of the Environmental Arbitrator's determination of all
Environmental Disputes submitted to the Environmental Arbitrator for
determination or the Parties' agreement as to the resolution of such
Environmental Disputes and the Title Arbitrator's determination of all Title
Disputes submitted to the Title Arbitrator for determination or the Parties'
agreement as to the resolution of such Title Dispute, then, with respect to
the Environmental Defect Property subject to such Environmental Dispute, if
(A) the Parties had elected (or were deemed to have elected) the remedy in
Section 14.1(c)(i), then within ten Business Days after the Environmental
Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his decision with
respect thereto (or the Parties otherwise agree as to the resolution of such
Environmental Dispute), and subject to Section 14.1(e), Buyer and Upstream
Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver
out of the Closing Date Environmental Escrow Amount (1) to Upstream Seller the
amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Upstream Seller
with respect to such Environmental Dispute (or as agreed by the Parties with
respect thereto) and (2) to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the
Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer with respect to such Environmental Dispute
(or as agreed by the Parties with respect thereto), (B) the Parties had
elected the remedy in Section 14.1(c)(ii) or Section 14.1(c)(iv), then the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into the applicable
Environmental Indemnity Agreement within ten Business Days after the
Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Upstream Seller
of his decision with respect thereto (or the Parties otherwise agree as to the
resolution of such Environmental Dispute), and after entering into such
Environmental Indemnity Agreement the applicable Party shall assume
responsibility to Remediate the applicable Environmental Defect and Buyer and
Upstream Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
to deliver out of the Closing Date Environmental Escrow Amount to Upstream
Seller an amount equal to the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in good
faith in the applicable Environmental Defect Notice applicable to such
Environmental Dispute, or (C) the Parties (or Upstream Seller, as permitted
under Section 14.1(c)) had elected the remedy in Section 14.1(c)(iii), then
within ten Business Days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written
notice to Buyer and Upstream Seller of his decision with respect thereto (or
the Parties otherwise agree as to the resolution of such Environmental
Dispute), Upstream Seller and Buyer shall once again elect between the
remedies in Section 14.1(c) pursuant to the terms thereof, mutatis mutandis,
and (1) clause (A) or (B) of this Section 14.1(f)(v) shall apply, as
applicable, or (2) if Section 14.1(c)(iii) is applicable with respect to such
Environmental Defect Property, Buyer and Upstream Seller shall deliver joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver out of the Closing Date
Environmental Escrow Amount to Buyer an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
the applicable Environmental Defect Property and Upstream Seller shall
continue to retain the applicable Environmental Defect Property and associated
Upstream Assets. Disbursements from the Environmental Escrow Amount pursuant
to this Section 14.1(f)(v) shall be made giving effect to Section 13.2(j)(ii)
and Section 14.1(e)(ii) so as to achieve the same result as if the matters
submitted to the Environmental Arbitrator for determination and to the Title
Arbitrator for determination had been resolved prior to Closing on the same
basis as so resolved pursuant to this Section 14.1(f) and Section 13.2(j).



(vi) Except as provided in the proviso of Section 4.4, nothing herein shall
operate to cause the Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration
hereunder and to the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties
as of the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted therefor as of the
Closing by the Closing Date Environmental Escrow Amount as provided in this
Section 14.1(f) and subsequent adjustments thereto will be made pursuant to
Section 3.5 and this Section 14.1.



14.2 NORM, Wastes and Other Substances. Buyer acknowledges that the Assets
have been used for exploration, development, production, gathering and
transportation of oil and gas and there may be petroleum, produced water,
wastes or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets or
associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may
contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach
itself to the inside of wells, pipelines, materials and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials and equipment
located on the Assets or included in the Assets may contain NORM and other
wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing material and/or other wastes
or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact with various environmental
media, including, water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may be required
for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of
environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances
from the Assets. Except for Environmental Conditions that form the basis of an
Environmental Defect (which Environmental Defect shall be treated as provided
in Article XIV) or a breach of the representations and warranties in Section
9.14, with respect to Assets actually acquired by Buyer at Closing, Buyer
assumes all Liability for the assessment, remediation, removal and disposal of
these materials.



ARTICLE XV

MISCELLANEOUS



15.1 Exhibits, Schedules and Appendices. All of the Exhibits, Schedules and
Appendices referred to in this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement.
Seller and Buyer and their respective counsel have received a complete set of
Exhibits, Schedules and Appendices prior to and as of the execution of this
Agreement.



15.2 Expenses and Taxes.



(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by Seller or Buyer in negotiating this Agreement or in consummating
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Person
incurring the same, including, legal and accounting fees, costs and expenses.



(b) All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments (including the
Assignment), conveyances or other instruments required to convey title to the
Assets and Partnership Interests to Buyer shall be borne by Buyer. Buyer shall
assume responsibility for, and shall bear and pay, all state sales and use
Taxes and transfer and similar Taxes (including any applicable interest or
penalties) incurred or imposed with respect to the transactions described in
this Agreement other than the Conversion (the "Transfer Taxes"). Seller and
Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.



(c) Allocation of Tax Responsibility.



(i) Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (A) any
Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time and (B) the portion of any
Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time;



(ii) Seller shall be allocated and bear all Income Taxes payable by the
Partnership attributable to (A) any Tax period ending on the Closing Date and
(B) the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date;



(iii) Buyer shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (A)
any Tax period beginning at or after the Effective Time and (B) the portion of
any Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time; and

 (iv) Buyer shall be allocated and bear all Income Taxes payable by the
Partnership attributable to (1) any Tax period beginning after the Closing
Date and (2) the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing
Date.



(d) For purposes of determining the allocations described in Section 15.2(c),
(i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production of
Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (iii), below)
shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or production giving
rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (ii) Asset Taxes that are based upon or
related to sales or receipts or imposed on a transactional basis (other than
such Asset Taxes described in clause (i) or (iii)), shall be allocated to the
period in which the transaction giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred,
(iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed
on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between
the portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective
Time and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time
by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of days in the applicable
Straddle Period that occur before the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
on the one hand, and the number of days in such Straddle Period that occur on
or after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the other hand, and
(iv) Income Taxes payable by the Partnership shall be allocated between the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of
such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date as if the taxable year
of the Partnership ended on the Closing Date. To the extent the Partnership is
included in a combined Texas franchise tax report with Seller or an Affiliate
of Seller, the allocation provided in this Section 15.2(d) shall be calculated
as if the Partnership left the combined group immediately after the Closing
Date.



(e) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax or Income Tax payable by
the Partnership is not known at the time an adjustment is to be made with
respect to such Asset Tax or Income Tax pursuant to Section 3.3, Section 3.4
and Section 3.5, as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the most recent
information available in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax or Income Tax
for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of an Asset
Tax or Income Tax payable by the Partnership (or the amount thereof paid or
economically borne by a Party) is ultimately determined to be different than
the amount (if any) that was taken into account in the Final Settlement
Statement as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.5, timely payments will
be made from one Party to the others to the extent necessary to cause each
Party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax or Income Tax that is allocable to
such Party under this Section 15.2.



(f) Subject to Buyer's right to reimbursement pursuant to Section 15.2(e),
Buyer shall (i) pay any Asset Taxes relating to any Tax period that ends
before or includes the Closing Date that become due and payable after the
Closing Date and file with the appropriate Taxing Authority any and all Tax
Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to such Asset
Taxes, (ii) submit each such Tax Return to Seller for its review and comment
reasonably in advance of the due date therefor, and (iii) timely file any such
Tax Return, incorporating any comments received from Seller prior to the due
date therefor. The Parties agree that (x) this Section 15.2(f) is intended to
solely address the timing and manner in which certain Tax Returns relating to
Asset Taxes are filed and the Asset Taxes shown thereon are paid to the
applicable Taxing Authority, and (y) nothing in this Section 15.2(f) shall be
interpreted as altering the manner in which Asset Taxes are allocated to and
economically borne by the Parties (except for any penalties, interest or
additions to Tax imposed as a result of any breach by Buyer of its obligations
under this Section 15.2(f), which shall be borne by Buyer).



(g) Seller shall prepare and file all Tax Returns of the Partnership for any
period ending on or before the Closing Date. Buyer shall prepare and file all
Tax Returns of the Partnership for any Straddle Period that are due after the
Closing Date. The Party preparing any such Tax Return (other than any Tax Return with respect to Income Taxes of the Partnership for any period ending
on or before the Closing Date) shall (1) submit to the other Party each such
Tax Return for its review and comment reasonably in advance of the due date
therefor, (2) consider, in good faith, any comments to such Tax Return and (3)
shall pay any Taxes shown as due and payable thereon subject to its right to
reimbursement pursuant to Section 15.2(e).



(h) The amount of any refunds or credits of (i) Income Taxes of the
Partnership for any Tax period ending on the Closing Date, or the portion of
any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and (ii) other Taxes of the
Partnership for any Tax period ending before the Effective Time or the portion
of any Straddle Period ending immediately before the Effective Time, shall in
each case be for the account of Seller except to the extent such refunds or
credits were taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 3.3, Section 3.4 and Section 3.5, as applicable. The
amount of any refunds or credits of (A) Income Taxes of the Partnership for
any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date, or the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date and (B) other Taxes of the
Partnership for any Tax period beginning at the Effective Time or the portion
of any Straddle Period beginning at the Effective, Time shall in each case be
for the account of Buyer. The amount of any refund or credit of Taxes of the
Partnership for any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between
Buyer and Seller in accordance with the principles set forth in Section
15.2(c), as applicable. Each Party shall forward, and shall cause its
Affiliates to forward, to the Party entitled to receive a refund or credit of
Tax pursuant to this Section 15.2(h) the amount of such refund within 30 days
after such refund is received or credit is realized, net of any reasonable
third-party costs or expenses incurred by such Party or its Affiliates in
procuring such refund or credit.



(i) Any payments made to any Party pursuant to this Agreement after the
Closing Date shall constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and shall be treated as such by Buyer and Seller on their Tax Returns
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.



(j) After the Closing, Buyer shall control the conduct of any audit,
adjustment, claim, examination, assessment, contest, or other proceeding with
respect to Asset Taxes or any Taxes payable by the Partnership (each a "Tax
Audit"). In the case of a Tax Audit after the Closing that could reasonably be
expected to result in a liability to Seller under this Agreement or otherwise,
(A) Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed and consult with Seller with
respect to any material issue relating to such Tax Audit, (B) Buyer shall
provide Seller copies of all correspondence, notices and other written
material received from any Governmental Authority with respect to such Tax
Audit, (C) Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of, and an opportunity to
review and comment on, all submissions made to a Governmental Authority in
connection with such Tax Audit, and (D) Buyer shall not agree to a settlement
or compromise thereof without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Parties expressly agree that any Tax Audit relating to U.S.
federal income taxes of the Partnership conducted with respect to the taxable
period ending on or prior to the date of the Conversion shall be controlled by
Seller; provided, however, that in the event Buyer or its Affiliates or the
Partnership would be subject to Liability (taking into account the Conversion)
as a result of such Tax Audit, then (1) Seller shall not agree to compromise
or settlement thereof without the prior written consent of Buyer (such consent
not be unreasonable withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (2) Seller and the
Partnership shall take all actions that may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to prevent the Partnership from having any liability for an
"imputed underpayment" (within the meaning of Section 6225 of the Code) or any
interest or penalty related thereto that is attributable to any adjustment of
any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Partnership for any
taxable period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the date of the
Conversion.



(k) The Parties acknowledge and agree that following the Conversion, the
Partnership will be classified as a disregarded entity under Section
301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii) of the Treasury Regulations, and both Buyer and Seller agree to report, for all applicable Tax reporting and
compliance purposes, the transfer and sale of the Midstream Interests as a
deemed asset sale for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



(l) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
required in connection with the filing of any Tax Returns, the qualification
for any exemption or reduction in Tax that may be available, State and Federal
regulatory reports, royalty payments including related deduction and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to these matters for the
Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Buyer agrees to allow access (upon request) to the Assets by
Seller, Seller's Representatives, auditors and State or Federal
representatives relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding.



15.3 Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by Buyer or Seller without
the prior written consent of the non-assigning Party; provided that (a)
without the consent of Seller, but only upon prior written notice to Seller
delivered on or before ten Business Days following the Execution Date (such
date, or such earlier date as Buyer delivers such written notice (or written
notice that it will not utilize such Affiliate assignment rights), the
"Assignment Drop Dead Date"), Buyer may assign all or part of this Agreement
to one or more Affiliates of Buyer, or (b) without the consent of Seller,
Buyer may collaterally assign its rights under this agreement to the Financing
Sources; provided that any such assignment shall not relieve Buyer of its
obligations hereunder without Seller's written consent. In the event the non-
assigning Party consents to any such assignment, such assignment shall not
relieve the assigning Party of any obligations and responsibilities hereunder.
Any assignment or other transfer by Buyer or its successors and assigns of any
of the Assets shall not relieve Buyer or its successors or assigns of any of
their obligations (including indemnity obligations) hereunder, as to the
Assets so assigned or transferred. Any assignment made in contravention of the
terms of this Section 15.3 shall be void ab initio.

participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the event of any
ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on the identity
of the draftsman of this Agreement.



15.5 Publicity.



(a) If Buyer desires to make or issue any public announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, it shall first give Seller 24
hours written notification of its desire to make such a public announcement.
The written notification shall include a written draft of the text of such
public announcement. Seller shall be given the right to provide comments to

to incorporate such comments into such public announcement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer shall not make or issue any such public announcement

(b) If Seller desires to make a public announcement, it shall first give Buyer
24 hours written notification of its intention to make a public announcement.

proposed public announcement, and Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to
incorporate such comments into such public announcement. Subject to the
Parties' rights and obligations discussed in Section 15.5(c), in no event
shall Seller disclose the identity of Buyer without the express written
consent of Buyer.

 (c) Nothing in this Section 15.5 shall prohibit any Party from issuing or
making a public announcement or statement if such Party deems it necessary to
do so in order to comply with any applicable Law or the rules of any stock
exchange upon which the Party's or a Party's Affiliate's capital stock is
traded; provided, however, that to the extent not inadvisable in such Party's
reasonable discretion, prior written notification shall be given to the other
Parties prior to any such announcement or statement.



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 15.5, from and
after the date that Seller or its Affiliate makes a public announcement
