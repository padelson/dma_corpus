is entitled to receive for all Company Shares held by such Company Shareholder
at the Closing shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after

withholding of such Company Shareholder's portion of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Shareholders' Agent Expense Amount
in respect of such Company Shares pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and Section

such Vested Company Option (the "Vested Option Payments"). The amount of cash
each holder of an In the Money Vested Company Option is entitled to receive
for such In the Money Vested Company Option shall, as a condition of payment,

following the Closing (a "Continuing Service Provider"), shall, on terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be cancelled and
represent the right to receive (each such right, an "Option Cash Right"),
subject to the same vesting terms and conditions set forth in the Company
Option Plan and the Company Option agreement relating thereto as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing, an amount in cash, with respect to each
Company Ordinary Share issuable upon the exercise of such In the Money

described in this ARTICLE 1. The Option Cash Rights, to the extent issued in
exchange for Unvested Company Options that are 102 Company Options, shall be
deposited with the 102 Trustee to be held and released in accordance with the
provisions of Section 102 of the Ordinance, the Option Tax Ruling, the Interim
Options Ruling or any other approval that may be issued by the ITA. Any
amounts forfeited from such Option Cash Right as a result of the failure of

Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) without Cause within
12 months following the Closing, shall be added to the Indemnity Escrow Fund

future right to receive any consideration therefor.

condition of payment, be subject to the execution and delivery of a Warrant

dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital shares), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Shares
occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the Closing, all references in
this Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class or series affected
thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of
shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby,
shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such share
split, reverse share split, share dividend, reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change.

vi.Withholding; Certain Tax Matters.

1.Each of Acquirer, the Paying Agent, Escrow Agent, the 102 Trustee, the
Company and its Subsidiaries (each, a "Payor") shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement all such amounts as the Payor reasonably determines are required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection therewith under the Code or
any provision of U.S. federal, state, local, Israeli, or other Tax law or
under any other Applicable Law, including the Ordinance, and to request and be
provided any necessary and validly executed Tax forms, including a valid
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or the appropriate version of Form W-8, as
applicable, and any similar information.

2.To the extent such amounts were so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall
be (i) treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid and (ii) timely
remitted by each Payor to the applicable Governmental Entity. In the case of
any amounts withheld, the withholding party shall provide written confirmation
of the amount so withheld to such Company Securityholder within 30 days of the
date of such withholding. To the extent such amounts are not so deducted and
withheld, such Person shall indemnify Payor for any amounts imposed by a
Governmental Entity (provided, however, that such indemnification obligation
shall not apply with respect to any fines, interest or other costs solely
related the failure of the Payor to properly withhold the applicable Taxes
unless such failure resulted from the information made available to Payor with
respect to such Person being untrue, incorrect or incomplete). 

3.Notwithstanding Sections 1.1(f)(i) and (ii), with respect to Israeli Taxes,
any consideration payable or otherwise to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement on the Closing to any Company Shareholder or Company Warrantholder
(each a "Payee") (other than consideration payable under Section 102 of the
Ordinance) shall be retained by the Paying Agent, for the benefit of such
Payee for a period of up to 180 days from the Closing or as otherwise
requested by the ITA (the "Withholding Drop Date"), during which time such
Payee may obtain (or, if one already exists, present to the Paying Agent) a
valid certificate or ruling issued by the ITA in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Acquirer and the Paying Agent (which, for the avoidance of doubt
includes Acquirer's opportunity to review the application submitted to the ITA
and the form of certificate or ruling): (i) exempting Acquirer and the Paying
Agent from the duty to withhold Israeli Taxes with respect to such payment to
Payee, (ii) determining the applicable rate or amounts of Israeli Taxes to be
withheld from the payment due to such Payee, or (iii) providing any other
instructions regarding the payment or withholding with respect to the
applicable portion of the consideration due to such Payee as determined by the
ITA (the "Qualified Withholding Certificate"). In the event that no later than
three Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop Date a Payee submits to
Acquirer and/or the Paying Agent, a Qualified Withholding Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall act in accordance with the provisions of such Qualified
Withholding Certificate, subject to any deduction and withholding (other than
Israeli Tax law) as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. If a Payee does
not provide Acquirer or the Paying Agent with a Qualified Withholding
Certificate no later than three Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop
Date, then the amount to be withheld and transferred to the ITA from the
amounts payable to such Payee shall be calculated according to the applicable
withholding rate as reasonably determined by Acquirer and the Paying Agent.
Such amount shall be delivered or caused to be delivered to the ITA by the
Paying Agent, and the Paying Agent shall release to such Payee the balance of
the amount due to such Payee that is not so withheld, subject to any deduction
and withholding as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code,
or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law (other than Israeli Tax
law). In the absence of a Qualified Withholding Certificate which also covers
the Payee's portion of the Shareholders' Agent Expense Fund, the applicable
amount of Israeli Tax to be withheld from such Payee's portion of any amount
paid or other consideration deliverable to such Payee immediately after
Closing will be calculated (as provided above) on such Payee's portion of the
Shareholders' Agent Expense Fund, and will be deducted and delivered to the
ITA as provided above, unless the ITA provides different written instructions
satisfactory to Acquirer.

4.Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything else to the contrary herein, with
regard to any portion of amounts paid to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent
shall act in accordance with Income Tax Circular 19/2018 (Transaction for Sale
of Rights in a Corporation that Includes Consideration that will be
Transferred to the Seller at Future Dates) (the "Circular") and shall provide
Acquirer, prior to the Closing, with an undertaking as required under Section
6.2.4.3 of the Circular.

5.In the event that the Payor receives a written demand from the ITA to
withhold any amount out of the amount held by such Payor for distribution to a
particular payee and transfer it to the ITA prior to the Withholding Drop
Date, such Payor (i) shall notify such payee of such matter promptly after
receipt of such demand, and provide such payee with reasonable time (unless
otherwise required by the ITA or any Applicable Law, including the Ordinance,
as determined by Payor at its reasonable discretion) to attempt to delay such
requirement or extend the period for complying with such requirement as
evidenced by a written certificate, ruling or confirmation from the ITA, and
(ii) to the extent that any such certificate, ruling or confirmation is not
timely provided by such payee to Acquirer, shall transfer to the ITA any
amount so demanded, including any interest, indexation and fines required by
the ITA in respect thereof, and such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such payee, only to the
extent such amounts are actually remitted to the ITA. 

6.Any withholding made in NIS with respect to payments made hereunder in USD
shall be calculated based on such USD/NIS as provided in Circular, unless
otherwise provided in any tax certificate or written instruction of the ITA,
and any currency conversion commissions will be borne by the applicable payee
and deducted from payments to be made to such payee.

7.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any payments (including
issuance of Option Cash Rights) made to holders of 102 Company Securities will
be subject to deduction or withholding of Israeli Tax under the Ordinance on
the 15th day of the calendar month following the month during which the
Closing occurs, unless with respect to Israeli resident holders of Company
Options and/or 102 Company Shares, the Options Tax Ruling (or the Interim
Options Ruling) shall have been obtained by the 15th day of the calendar month
following the month during which the Closing occurs, and in such case,
Acquirer or the Company, or any Person acting on their behalf shall act in
accordance with the Options Tax Ruling (or Interim Options Ruling).

8.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to holders of
Company Options who are not Israeli resident for Israeli Tax purposes, who
were granted such awards in consideration solely for work or services
performed outside of Israel (and who shall provide Acquirer and Paying Agent,
prior to any payment to them, with a validly executed declaration in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C regarding their non-Israeli residence and
confirmation that they were granted such awards in consideration solely for
work or services performed outside of Israel), such payments shall not be
subject to any withholding or deduction of Israeli Tax and shall be made
through the Company's or its Subsidiaries' payroll processing service or
system as set forth in Section 1.3(a)(v).

9.Israeli Tax Rulings. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Agreement
Date, the Company shall cause its Israeli counsel and/or Company Contractors,
in coordination with Acquirer and its Israeli counsel, to prepare and file
with the ITA an application for the following rulings, provided that Acquirer
and its Israeli counsel had the opportunity to review, comment and approve
each of such rulings' application (which for the avoidance of doubt such
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to
their filling with the ITA and the rulings prior to their approval by the ITA:

a.A ruling in relation to the 102 Company Securities and 3(i) Company Options,
confirming, among others, that: (i) neither the payment of the Aggregate
Consideration for 102 Company Shares or the Vested Option Payments for 102
Company Options, nor the payment of the Option Cash Right Payments for 102
Company Options, will constitute a violation of the requirements of Section
102 of the Ordinance, provided that the applicable consideration attributed to
holders of 102 Company Securities is deposited with the 102 Trustee for the
statutory minimum trust period under Section 102 of the Ordinance, (ii) the
tax event of the Option Cash Rights granted to holders of 102 Company Options
and 3(i) Company Options will be deferred to the actual payment of the Option
Cash Right Payments, (iii) Acquirer and anyone acting on its behalf, including
the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent, shall be exempt from withholding Tax in
relation to any payments or consideration transferred to the 102 Trustee in
relation to 102 Company Securities and 3(i) Company Options (including with
respect to the Aggregate Consideration for 102 Company Shares or the Vested
Option Payments for 102 Company Options, or the Option Cash Right Payments for
102 Company Options and 3(i) Company Options); and (iv) the transfer of the
Escrow Fund and Shareholders' Agent Expense Fund in respect of 102 Company
Securities and 3(i) Company Options shall not be subject to Israeli Tax until
actually received by the applicable Company Securityholder; which ruling may
be subject to customary conditions regularly associated with such a ruling
(the "Option Tax Ruling"). If the Option Tax Ruling is not granted by the
Closing Date, the Company shall seek to receive prior to such date an interim
tax ruling confirming among others that Acquirer and anyone acting on its
behalf (including the Paying Agent and Escrow Agent) shall be exempt from
Israeli withholding Tax in relation to any payments made to the 102 Trustee
with respect to 102 Company Securities and 3(i) Company Options (including with respect to
the Aggregate Consideration for 102 Company Shares or the Vested Option
Payments for 102 Company Options, or the payment by Acquirer or anyone acting
on its behalf of the Option Cash Rights granted under Section 102 of the
Ordinance) (which interim tax ruling may be subject to customary conditions
regularly associated with such an interim tax ruling) (the "Interim Options
Ruling," and collectively with Option Tax Ruling, the "Israeli Tax Rulings").

b.The parties (other than the Shareholders' Agent) will cause their respective
Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate and cooperate and
provide all information required with respect to the Company's preparation and
filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral
submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli
Tax Rulings. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company shall use
all efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
Israeli Tax Rulings as promptly as practicable; provided, that if none of such
Israeli Tax Rulings is obtained for any reason whatsoever by the Closing Date,
the Closing shall not be delayed or postponed. For the avoidance of doubt it
is clarified that the language of the Israeli Tax Rulings (as applicable)
and/or the application of such Israeli Tax Rulings (and for the avoidance of
doubt either the Interim Option Ruling and/or the Option Tax Ruling) shall be
subject to the prior approval of Acquirer or its counsel and any submission to
the ITA shall be made only after Acquirer and/or its counsel have been granted
with such approval and any agreement reached with the ITA with respect to the
Israeli Tax Rulings shall first be received with the approval of the Acquirer
and/or its counsel and only thereafter will be agreed and closed with the ITA.
The Company will inform the Acquirer in advance of any meeting or other
discussion with the ITA with respect to any of the Israeli Tax Rulings and
allow Acquirer's counsel to attend such meeting and participate in such
discussions. Should Acquirer's counsel not attend any such meeting or
discussion with the ITA, the counsel of the Company shall promptly provide
Acquirer's counsel with an update of such meeting or discussion.

10.The parties intend that the Share Purchase be a Taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party
hereto is relying solely on the advice of his, her or its own Tax advisors
with respect to the Tax consequences of the Share Purchase.

vii.Spreadsheet. Acquirer is permitted and authorized to rely on the
allocations set forth in the Spreadsheet and shall have no responsibility or
liability with respect to any error in such allocations. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the
aggregate consideration paid by Acquirer to the Company Securityholders and
any amounts deposited in the Escrow Fund and Shareholders' Agent Expense Fund,
exceed or be lower than the Aggregate Consideration. For clarity, the
aggregate consideration paid by Acquirer to the Company Securityholders shall
include any amounts in respect of the Option Cash Rights, assuming for these
purposes the full vesting of all such Option Cash Rights.

viii.Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
the closing of the Transactions, including the consummation of the Share
Purchase (the "Closing") shall take place remotely by an agreed electronic
exchange of applicable executed documents, or at a location as Acquirer and
the Company agree, at 10:00 a.m. U.S. Central time on a date to be agreed by
Acquirer and the Company, which date shall be no later than the third Business
Day following the date on which all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 7
of this Agreement have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions

Warrant would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity, any amounts payable in respect of such Converting

the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Acquirer, free
and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled

to the shares of Company Share Capital represented by such Converting
Instrument, Company Option or Company Warrant, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of Acquirer or the Company of shares
of Company Share Capital that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to

(ii) the amount of unpaid Company Debt as of the Closing Date and immediately
prior to the Closing, and (iii) the amount of unpaid Transaction Expenses as

Agent and its representatives reasonable access upon reasonable notice to the
records, properties, and personnel relating to the preparation of the Acquirer

the Shareholders' Agent in connection with its review of the Acquirer Closing
Statement.

(b) The Shareholders' Agent shall have 30 days within which to review the
Acquirer Closing Statement after Acquirer's delivery thereof. The
Shareholders' Agent may object to any calculation set forth in the Acquirer
Closing Statement by providing written notice of such objection to Acquirer
such 30-day period after Acquirer's delivery of the Acquirer Closing Statement
(the "Notice of Objection"), together with the basis of its objection in
reasonable detail and any supporting documentation, information and
calculations. If a Notice of Objection is not provided within such 30-day
period, the Acquirer Closing Statement (and each of the calculations set forth
therein) shall be deemed final.

(c) If the Shareholders' Agent provides the Notice of Objection, then Acquirer
and the Shareholders' Agent shall confer in good faith for a period of up to
20 days following Acquirer's receipt of the Notice of Objection in an attempt
to resolve any disputed matter set forth in the Notice of Objection, and any
resolution by them shall be in writing and shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and the Indemnifying Parties.

(d) If, after the 20-day period set forth in Section 1.6(c), Acquirer and the
Shareholders' Agent cannot resolve any matter set forth in the Notice of
Objection, then Acquirer and the Shareholders' Agent shall engage the Israeli
offices of Grant Thornton LLP or such other independent certified public
accounting firm nationally recognized in the United States that is acceptable
to both Acquirer and the Shareholders' Agent or, if such firm is not able or
willing to so act, another auditing firm acceptable to both Acquirer and the
Shareholders' Agent (the "Reviewing Accountant") to review only the matters in
the Notice of Objection that are still disputed by Acquirer and the
Shareholders' Agent and any calculations to the extent relevant thereto. After
such review and a review of the Company's relevant books and records, the
Reviewing Accountant shall promptly (and in any event within 15 days following
its engagement) determine the resolution of such remaining disputed matters,
which determination shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and the
Indemnifying Parties.

(e) If the Aggregate Consideration as finally determined pursuant to Section
1.6(b), Section 1.6(c) and/or Section 1.6(d), is greater than the Closing
Consideration that was calculated in accordance with the Company Closing
Financial Certificate (such difference, the "Aggregate Consideration Surplus"), then within three Business Days following such determination the
Aggregate Consideration Surplus shall be wired by Acquirer to the Paying
Agent, the U.S. Subsidiary (with respect to U.S. Optionholders) or the 102
Trustee (with respect to holders of 102 Company Securities and Unvested
Company Options), as applicable for further distribution to the Indemnifying
Parties in accordance with their Consideration Portion of such Aggregate
Consideration Surplus, and Acquirer and the Shareholders' Agent shall submit a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing Escrow Agent to pay,
within three Business Days following submission of such joint instruction, to
the Paying Agent, the U.S. Subsidiary (with respect to U.S. Company
Optionholders) or the 102 Trustee (with respect to holders of 102 Company
Securities and Unvested Company Options), as applicable, the Adjustment Escrow
Fund for further distribution to the Indemnifying Parties based on their
Consideration Portion of such Adjustment Escrow Fund.

(f) If the Aggregate Consideration as finally determined pursuant to Section
1.6(b), Section 1.6(c) and/or Section 1.6(d), as the case may be, is less than
the Closing Consideration that was calculated in accordance with the Company
Closing Financial Certificate (such difference, the "Aggregate Consideration
Shortfall"), the Aggregate Consideration Shortfall shall be recovered by
Acquirer from the Adjustment Escrow Fund. A joint written instruction setting
forth the Aggregate Consideration Shortfall to be paid to Acquirer and, if
applicable, any remaining Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Parties,
shall be prepared, signed by Acquirer and the Shareholders' Agent and
delivered to the Escrow Agent within three Business Days following the
determination of the Aggregate Consideration Shortfall. Upon receipt of such
instruction, the Escrow Agent shall distribute within three Business Days
following submission of such joint instruction to Acquirer such amount of cash
from the Adjustment Escrow Fund and, if applicable, any remaining Adjustment
Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent, the U.S. Subsidiary (with respect to U.S.
Optionholders) or the 102 Trustee (with respect to holders of 102 Company
Securities), as applicable, for further distribution to the Indemnifying
Parties based on their Consideration Portion of such Adjustment Escrow Fund.

(g) The fees, costs and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant shall be
allocated between the Shareholders' Agent (on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties), on the one hand, and Acquirer, on the other hand, in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted to the
Reviewing Accountant that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as
finally determined by the Reviewing Accountant) bears to the total amount of
such disputed items so submitted.

been no interferences, re-examinations or oppositions brought or threatened to

any Contract of the Company or any Subsidiary governing or relating to any

Transactions will not result in the modification, cancellation, termination,
suspension of, or acceleration of any rights, obligations or payments with
respect to the Company IP Agreements, or give any non-Company party to any
Company IP Agreement the right to do any of the foregoing.

(ix) No Contract that the Company or any Subsidiary is a party to grant any
third party exclusive rights to or under any Company-Owned IP or, other than

the Company or any Subsidiary.

(xi) There at all times has been and is no unauthorized use, unauthorized

(xiv) None of the Company-Owned IP, the Current Company Products, the
Development Products, the Company or any Subsidiary is subject to any
outstanding judgment, writ, decree, stipulation, determination, decision,
award, preliminary or permanent injunction, or temporary restraining order
issued by a Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary, Contract (A) restricting in any manner the use, transfer, or licensing by the
Company or any Subsidiary of any Company-Owned IP except for restrictions on
the use of Open Source Materials and "off the shelf" licenses contained in the
Contracts governing the use of such Third Party Intellectual Property that is
used in any Current Company Product, (B) which may affect the validity or
enforceability of any Company-Owned IP, or (C) restricting the conduct of the
business of the Company or any Subsidiary in order to accommodate Third Party
Intellectual Property.

(xv) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice or opinion

misappropriates, or otherwise violates any Third Party Intellectual Property.

(xvi) Each of the Company and each Subsidiary has secured from all Company
Service Providers who independently or jointly contributed to the conception,
reduction to practice, creation or development of any Intellectual Property
for the Company or any Subsidiary (each an "Author") unencumbered and
unrestricted exclusive ownership of, all such contributions created in
connection with their services to the Company or any Subsidiary. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and each Subsidiary has obtained
proprietary information and invention disclosure and assignment agreements
from all current and former Authors and the Company and each Subsidiary has
agreed with all of their respective current and former Company Service
Providers that the Company or any Subsidiary shall be the author (to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law) or owner (to the extent the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary is not permitted to be the author under Applicable Law)
of all works that such Company Service Providers have independently or jointly
created for the Company or any Subsidiary during or otherwise in connection
with their services to the Company or any Subsidiary, and all such respective
current and former Company Service Providers have waived and agreed not to
assert any and all Moral Rights with respect to the Company-Owned IP. All
current and former Israeli Company Employees who independently or jointly
contributed to the conception, reduction to practice, creation or development
of any Company-Owned IP have expressly and irrevocably waived, and none of
such persons has the right to receive, compensation in connection with
"Service Inventions" under Section 134 of the Israeli Patent Law-1967. The
Company has made available to Acquirer copies of all forms of such disclosure
and assignment documents currently and historically used by the Company and
each Subsidiary with Company Service Providers (the "Form IP Assignment
Agreements") and, in the case of patents and patent applications, the Company
has made available to Acquirer copies of all such assignments.

(xvii) No Company Service Provider: (i) is in violation of any term or
covenant of any Contract executed with the Company or any Subsidiary relating
to employment, invention disclosure, invention assignment, non-disclosure or
non-competition or any other Contract with any other party by virtue of such
Company Service Provider's being employed by, or performing services for, the
Company or any Subsidiary or using trade secrets or proprietary information of
others without permission or (ii) has developed any technology, software or
other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work for the Company
or any Subsidiary that is subject to any agreement under which such Company
Service Provider has assigned or otherwise granted to any third party any
rights (including Intellectual Property rights) in or to such technology,
software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work.

(xviii) Other than with respect to Moral Rights to the extent any cannot be
fully and irrevocably assigned or waived, no Company Service Provider has any
right, license, claim or interest whatsoever in or with respect to any
Company-Owned IP.

(xix) To the extent that any Intellectual Property that is or was Third Party
Intellectual Property is incorporated into, integrated or bundled with, or
used by the Company or any Subsidiary in the development, manufacture,
distribution or compilation of any of the Current Company Products, the
Company or a Subsidiary has a written agreement with the owner or authorized
sublicensee of the owner of such Third Party Intellectual Property with respect thereto
pursuant to which the Company or a Subsidiary either (A) has obtained
complete, unencumbered and unrestricted ownership of, and is the exclusive
owner of such Intellectual Property by operation of law or by valid assignment
or (B) has obtained valid licenses sufficient for the conduct of the Business
to all such Third Party Intellectual Property.

(xx) The Company and the Subsidiaries have taken all commercially reasonable
steps to protect and preserve all Confidential Information including in the
Company IP ("Company Confidential Information"). All disclosure of Company
Confidential Information to a third party and the Company's or any
Subsidiary's use thereof at any time has not been in such a manner that it
would interfere with, diminish, or waive Company's or any Subsidiary's trade
secret rights in what would otherwise qualify as Company-Owned IP. All use,
disclosure or appropriation by the Company or any Subsidiary of any
Confidential Information not owned by the Company or any Subsidiary at any
time has not been in violation of the terms of a written agreement between the
Company or the Subsidiaries and the owner of such Confidential Information, or
is otherwise lawful. All current and former Company Service Providers having
access to Company Confidential Information or proprietary information of any
of their respective customers or business partners have executed and delivered
to the Company an agreement that protects and ensures adequate confidential
treatment of such Confidential Information or proprietary information (in the
case of proprietary information of the Company's or any Subsidiary's customers
and business partners, to the extent required by such customers and business
partners).

(xxi) Schedule 2.9(b)(xxi)(A) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all
Open Source Materials that are incorporated into, or integrated or distributed
with, or used in the development, testing, or delivery of any Company Product.
Except as set forth in Schedule 2.9(b)(xxi)(B) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule the Company at all times has been and is in compliance with the terms
and conditions of all licenses for Open Source Materials used by the Company
or any Subsidiary in connection with the development, production or
distribution of any Company Products.

(xxii) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has (A) incorporated Open Source
Materials into, or combined Open Source Materials with, the Company IP or
Company Products, (B) distributed Open Source Materials in conjunction with
any Company IP or Company Products or (C) used Open Source Materials, in each
case, in such a way that, with respect to (A), (B), or (C), creates, or
purports to create obligations for the Company or any Subsidiary with respect
to any such Company IP to grant, or purport to grant, to any third party, any
rights or immunities under any such Company IP (including using any Open
Source Materials that require, as a condition of use, modification and/or
distribution of such Open Source Materials that other Company IP incorporated
into, derived from or distributed with such Open Source Materials be (x)
disclosed or distributed in source code form, (y) be licensed for the purpose
of making derivative works or (z) be redistributable at no charge).

(xxiii) The Technology included in or used in the provision of the Current
Company Products: (A) is, except for errors, defects, or bugs that are curable
without material expense or delay, free from defects or deficiencies, errors
in design, and operating defects that materially and adversely affect the use,
functionality or performance of such Technology or any product or system
containing or used in conjunction with such Technology, and (B) does not
contain any virus, malware, disabling mechanisms or protection features that
are designed to disrupt, disable, harm or otherwise impede in a manner that
materially and adversely affects the authorized operation of, or provide
unauthorized access to, a computer system or network or other device on which
such Technology is stored or installed or damage or destroy any data or file
without the user's consent.

(xxiv) The Company has documented all material bugs, errors and defects in all
the Company Products, and such documentation is retained and is available
internally at the Company. The Company Products can be legally sold and used in each geographical market in
which they are sold by the Company or a Subsidiary.

(xxv) For all Technology used by the Company or any Subsidiary in providing
services, or in developing or making available any of the Company Products,
the Company or applicable Subsidiary has implemented any and all security
patches or upgrades that are generally available for that Technology.

(xxvi) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.9(b)(xxvi) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no (A) government funding, (B) facilities of a university, college,
other educational institution or research center or (C) funding from any
Person (other than funds received in consideration for shares of Company Share
Capital, from loans or other credit lines or from earnings) was used in the
development of the Company-Owned IP. No Company Service Provider who was
involved in, or who contributed to, the creation or development of any
Company-Owned IP, has performed services for any government (including the
Israel Defense Forces), university, college or other educational institution
or research center during a period of time during which such Company Service
Provider was also performing services for the Company or any Subsidiary. No
Governmental Entity (including the Israel Defense Forces), university, college
or other educational institution or research center has any right, license,
claim or interest in any Company IP by reason of a Company Service Provider
having studied or worked at any of such institutions during the period of time
that such Company Service Provider was also performing services for the
Company or any Subsidiary.

(xxvii) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.9(b)(xxvii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any other
Person then acting on their behalf has disclosed, delivered or licensed to any
Person (other than Company's employees working from the Israeli office),
agreed to disclose, deliver or license to any Person, or permitted the
disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or other Person of, any Company
Source Code. No event has occurred, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the
disclosure, delivery or license by the Company or any Subsidiary or any Person
then acting on their behalf to any Person of any Company Source Code. Schedule
2.9(b)(xxvii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Contract
pursuant to which the Company or any Subsidiary has deposited, or is or may be
required to deposit, with an escrow holder or any other Person, any of the
Company Source Code. The execution of this Agreement and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in and of themselves, would not
reasonably be expected to result in the release from escrow of any Company
Source Code or other provision of any Company Source Code to a third party.

(xxviii) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is now or has ever been a
member or promoter of, or a contributor to, any development community,
industry standards body or any similar organization that would reasonably be
expected to require or obligate any of the Company or any Subsidiary to grant
or offer to any other Person any license or right to any Company-Owned IP.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has a present obligation to grant or
offer to any other Person any license or right to any Company-Owned IP by
virtue of the Company's, the Subsidiaries' or any other Person's membership
in, promotion of, or contributions to any development community, industry
standards body or any similar organization. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is now or has ever been a member of any patent non-aggression,
pooling, cross-licensing or similar community, network or organization, or a
party to any related or similar Contract, that restricts in any manner the
enforcement of patent rights included in the Company-Owned IP or requires, or
in the event of an acquisition or transfer of Company-Owned IP could require,
the grant of a license or other immunity under such patent rights to another
Person.

(xxix) The Company and the Subsidiaries maintain, and all times have
maintained, posted Privacy Policies on all websites and online services owned,
maintained or operated by or for the Company or any Subsidiary. The data Processing and privacy and
security practices of the Company, the Subsidiaries, and their service
providers (in the case of service providers, relating to their services
performed for the Company or any Subsidiary) relating to Covered Data comply,
and at all times have complied, with all Contracts, Privacy Policies, and
Applicable Laws relating to data processing (collectively, the "Data
Processing Commitments"). Neither the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement nor the disclosure or transfer to, or taking over by Acquirer
or any Affiliate of Acquirer of, Covered Data will cause, constitute, or
result in a breach or violation of any Data Processing Commitments. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has been a party or the subject of any Legal
Proceeding, Order, or regulatory opinion, and no such actions are or have been
threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary by any Governmental Entity or
other Person, (i) relating to any actual or potential non-compliance with any
Data Processing Commitments, (ii) permitting or mandating relevant
Governmental Entities to investigate, demand or request information from, or
enter the premises of, the Company or any Subsidiary relating to the Company's
or the Subsidiaries' practices pertaining to Covered Data, or (iii) claiming
compensation from the Company or any Subsidiary relating to Covered Data or
Data Processing Commitments.

(xxx) The Company and each Subsidiary has established and maintains reasonable
and appropriate technical, physical and organizational measures and security
systems, plans, policies, and technologies related to the Systems and Covered
Data in compliance with all Data Processing Commitments, and at all times have
taken all industry-standard measures (including implementing and monitoring
compliance with reasonable and appropriate measures with respect to technical
and physical security) to protect all Systems and Covered Data against loss
and against unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or other misuse
to comply with all Data Processing Commitments, including an appropriate
incident response program relating to Security Incidents. Schedule 2.9(b)(xxx)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule describes all Databases maintained by or
for the Company or any Subsidiary that are covered by Israel's data protection
law (the Protection of the Privacy Laws, 5741-1981) and whether such Databases
are registered with any Governmental Entity in Israel. The Company and each
Subsidiary has eliminated or otherwise remediated all vulnerabilities of
medium severity or priority level or greater, and any other material
deficiencies, identified in any security-related reviews or assessments
conducted by or for the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, or that
otherwise have been communicated to the Company or such Subsidiary.

(xxxi) There has been no Security Incident or violation of any Data Processing
Commitments in relation to any System or Covered Data that has occurred or, to
the Company's Knowledge, is threatened. There has been no unauthorized or
illegal Processing of any Covered Data, and no circumstance has arisen in
which any Data Processing Commitment would require the Company or any
Subsidiary to notify a Governmental Entity or any Person of a Security
Incident.

(xxxii) Where the Company or any Subsidiary uses a data processor to Process
Covered Data, there is in existence a written Contract between the Company or
a Subsidiary and each such data processor that complies with the requirements
of all Data Processing Commitments and that requires the data processor to, at
minimum, comply with applicable Data Processing Commitments and to use
reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect such Covered Data. The
Company has made available to Acquirer true, correct and complete copies of
all such Contracts. No data processor has breached any Contracts relating to
Covered Data Processed by such Persons for the Company or any Subsidiary.

(xxxiii) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has transferred or authorized
the transfer of Covered Data outside of the originating country, except where
such transfers have complied with all Data Processing Commitments. 

(xxxiv) The computer, information technology and data processing systems,
facilities and services in the custody or control of the Company or any
Subsidiary, including all software, hardware, networks, communications
facilities, platforms and related systems and services in the custody or
control of the Company or any Subsidiary (collectively, "Systems"), are
sufficient for the existing needs of the Company and each Subsidiary and, with
respect to the reasonable anticipated future needs of the Company and each
Subsidiary, can be acquired without undue expense or delay, including as to
capacity, scalability and ability to process current peak volumes in a secure
and timely manner. The Systems are in good working condition to effectively
perform all computing, information technology and data processing operations
of the Company and each Subsidiary as currently conducted. Except as set forth
in Schedule 2.9(b)(xxxiv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all Systems,
other than software or hardware that is duly and validly licensed or provided
to the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to a valid and enforceable Contract,
are owned and operated by or are under the control of the Company or
applicable Subsidiary. From and after the Closing Date, the Company and any
Subsidiary will have and be permitted to exercise the same rights with respect
to the Systems as the Company and any Subsidiary would have had and been able
to exercise had this Agreement not been entered into and the Share Purchase
and Transactions not occurred, without the payment of any additional amounts
or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties, or payments which the
Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have been required to pay anyway.
The Company has developed and maintained appropriate disaster recovery plans,
procedures and facilities for the Business.

(xxxv) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.9(b)(xxxv) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has not obtained any Governmental Grants. The Company
has made available to the Acquirer correct copies of all letters of approval,
certificates of completion, undertakings, supplements or amendments thereto
for Governmental Grants, granted to the Company and all material
correspondence related thereto, including the most recent and updated status
of account report from the IIA (titled "Keren Tmura Status of Account").
Schedule 2.9(b)(xxxv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth: (i) the
aggregate amount of each payment or transfer made on account of a Governmental
Grant; (ii) the aggregate outstanding obligations of the Company under each
Governmental Grant with respect to royalties or other payments; and (iii) the
composition of such obligations or amounts by the patent or other Intellectual
Property, product or product family to which it relates. The Company is in
compliance, in all material respects, with the terms and conditions of the
Governmental Grants and has duly fulfilled all the undertakings relating
thereto and no event has occurred or circumstances exist that would reasonably
be expected to result in the revocation or modification of any Governmental
Grant.

(xxxvi) All rights in, to and under all Intellectual Property created by the
founders for or on behalf or in contemplation of the Company or any Subsidiary
(i) prior to the inception of the Company the applicable Subsidiary, or (ii)
prior to their commencement of employment with the Company or the applicable
Subsidiary have been duly and validly assigned to the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary, and the Company has no reason to believe that any such
Person is unwilling to provide the Company or its designee with such
cooperation as may reasonably be required to complete and prosecute all
appropriate patent and copyright filings related thereto.

2.10 Taxes.

(a) The Company and the Subsidiaries have properly completed and timely filed
(taking into account any applicable extensions requested and approved in the
ordinary course of business) all income and other material Tax Returns
required to be filed by it prior to the Closing Date with any Governmental
Entity, including any Tax Authority, have timely paid all Taxes required to be
paid by them, and have no Liability for Taxes in excess of the amounts so
paid. All such Tax Returns were and are complete and accurate in all material
respects and have been prepared in material compliance with Applicable Law. There is no written claim for Taxes being asserted against the Company or any
Subsidiary that has resulted in an Encumbrance against any of the assets of
the Company or any Subsidiary.

(b) The Company has made available to Acquirer true, correct and complete
copies of all income and other Tax Returns filed, and, if prepared, any
examination reports and statements of deficiencies, adjustments and proposed

with respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.

(c) The Company Balance Sheet reflects all Liabilities for unpaid Taxes of the
Company and the Subsidiaries for periods (or portions of periods) through the
Company Balance Sheet Date. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any
Liability for unpaid Taxes accruing after the Company Balance Sheet Date
except for Taxes arising in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice following the Company Balance Sheet Date. Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary has any Liability for Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
that are not included in the calculation of Company Net Working Capital.

(d) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.10(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there is (i) to the Company's Knowledge, no pending audit of, or Tax
controversy associated with, any Tax Return of the Company and the

Company has not received any written notice thereof, (ii) no other procedure,
proceeding or contest of any refund or deficiency in respect of Taxes pending

2.11 Employee Benefit Plans and Employee Matters.

(a) The Company has made available a complete and accurate list of all current

by Applicable Law (the "Company Employee List"), which reflects each such
Company Employee's: (i) name and employee identification number, (ii) date(s)
of hire, (iii) position or job title, (iv) full-time or part-time status, (v)
classification as either exempt or non-exempt from the overtime requirements
under any Applicable Law, (vi) annual base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, (vii) total target bonus or commission, earned, and total for
which they remain eligible, as applicable, (viii) any other compensation
payable or material fringe benefits for which each such Company Employee is
eligible, including housing allowance, deferred compensation, or commission
arrangements, vacation/paid time off entitlement and amount accrued, travel
pay and car entitlement, if applicable, sick leave entitlement and accrual,
recuperation pay entitlement and accrual, (ix) entitlement to pension
arrangement and/or any other provident fund (including manager's insurance,
pensions fund and education fund), their respective contribution rates and the
salary basis for such contributions whether such employee is subject to
Section 14 Arrangement ("Section 14 Arrangement") under the Israeli Severance
Pay Law - 1963 (the "Severance Pay Law"), (x) extent of notice period to which
such employee is entitled in advance of termination, if any, except as
required by Applicable Law; (xi) country and, if applicable, state of
employment, and (xii) whether the employee is on leave (and if so, the date on
which such leave commenced and the date of expected return to work, if known).
Except for the employees included in the Company Employee List who hold senior
positions and therefore are exempt from the provisions of the Working Hours
and Rest Law, 1951, all Company Employees in Israel receive a monthly salary
that includes a global overtime component equal to 20% of each Company
Employee's monthly salary. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.11(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the services provided by all U.S.-based Company
Employees are terminable at the will of the Company and any such termination
would result in no liability to the Company. The Company has not made any
promises or commitments to any of the Company Employees, whether in writing or
not, with respect to any future changes or additions to any of their
compensation or benefits. Other than as provided in the Company Employee List,
(i) there are no other employees employed by the Company, and (ii) all current
and former employees of the Company have signed an employment agreement, offer
letter, or similar agreement substantially in the form or forms delivered or
made available to Acquirer. No employee of the Company is entitled (whether by
virtue of any law, contract or otherwise) to any benefits, entitlement or
compensation that is not set forth in the Company Employee List or Schedule
2.11(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or that should be reclassified as
part of their determining salary for all intent and purposes, including for
the social contributions. All current Company Employees are subject to a
Section 14 Arrangement and have been subject to such arrangement from the
commencement date of their employment and on their entire salary. As of the
Agreement Date, there is no Person who has accepted an offer of employment
made by the Company or any Subsidiary but whose employment has not yet
started. Except as set forth in the Company Employee List, no senior
management level employee of the Company has been dismissed in the last 12
months prior to the Agreement Date.

initial date of such individual's engagement, (iv) the term of engagement and
any notice period related to the termination of such engagement, (v) a summary

such Company Contractor to the Company or any Subsidiary. Except as set forth
on the Company Contractor List, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary engages
any personnel through manpower agencies.

(c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary sponsors or maintains any self-
funded Company Employee Plan, including any plan to which a stop-loss policy
applies. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the IRS a favorable determination
letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to
the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, or
has applied (or has time remaining in which to apply) to the IRS for such a
determination letter prior to the expiration of the requisite period under
applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for
such determination letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination or has been established under a standardized prototype
or volume submitter plan for which an IRS opinion or advisory letter has been
obtained by the plan sponsor and is valid as to the adopting employer. The
Company has made available to Acquirer a true, correct and complete copy of
the most recent Internal Revenue Service, or other authorized Tax Authority
determination or opinion letter issued with respect to each such Company
Employee Plans, and nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such
letter that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the Tax-
qualified status of any Company Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the
Code. The Company has made available to Acquirer all registration statements
and prospectuses prepared in connection with each Company Employee Plan. Any
Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under the Tax laws and
regulations of Israel fulfills all applicable requirements for such
qualification and nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
cause the loss of any such tax-qualified status. The Company has made
available to Acquirer true and complete copies of any ITA or other authorized
Tax Authority letter or ruling issued with respect to any such Company
Employee Plans.

(d) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any person other than as required under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA")
or similar law of any state of foreign jurisdiction and the Company and the
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with the requirements of
COBRA. Each Company Employee Plan complies, in both form and operation, in all
material respects, with its terms and with all Applicable Laws, and no
condition exists or event has occurred with respect to any such plan which
would reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence by the Company,
Acquirer or its Affiliates of any liability, fine or penalty. All returns,
reports and disclosure statements required to be made under ERISA and the Code
with respect to all Company Employee Plans have been timely filed or
delivered. No action, suit, investigation, audit, proceeding or claim (other
than routine claims for benefits) is pending against or, to the knowledge of
the Company, is threatened against any Company Employee Plan before any
arbitrator or any Governmental Entity, including the IRS.

(e) Each Company Employee Plan (other than individual employment agreements)
can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in
accordance with its terms, without liability to Acquirer or its Affiliates
(other than ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in a
termination event).

(f) Neither the Company nor any current or former ERISA Affiliate currently
maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes to, or has ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any
pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to
Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of 

(g) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or has made any
contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation under, any "multiemployer
plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or any "multiple
employer plan" as such term is defined in Section 413(c) of the Code.

(h) The Company and the Subsidiaries have duly maintained and been
contributing to all mandatory and contractual employee saving funds, pension
and severance accounts (including any manager's insurance, pension fund and
education fund) in compliance with all Applicable Laws and employment
agreements.

(i) The Company and the Subsidiaries are operated, and have at all times
during the past seven years been operated, in compliance in all material
respects with all Applicable Laws relating to employment, termination of
employment and labor matters, including but not limited to, discrimination in
employment, terms and conditions of employment, worker classification
(including the proper classification of workers as independent contractors,
consultants and advisors), wages, pay slips, working hours, recording and
reporting work hours, overtime and overtime payments, working during rest
days, social benefits contributions, termination and severance payment and

extension orders, civil rights, safety and health, immigration, work-
authorization, privacy issues, fringe benefits, employment practices and the
collection and payment of withholding or social security taxes and any similar
tax. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any outstanding obligations
with respect to non-payment of wages. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has in the last three years received written notice of complaints, charges or
claims against the Company or any Subsidiary, and there are no controversies,
complaints, charges or claims pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, between the Company or any Subsidiary and any Company Employees,
based on, arising out of, in connection with or otherwise relating to the
employment or termination of employment or failure to employ by the Company or
any Subsidiary, of any individual or Company Contractors, which controversies
have resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in a Legal Proceeding
before any Governmental Entity. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any
Liability with respect to any misclassification of any service provider of the
Company or any Subsidiary (A) as an independent contractor, consultant,
advisor or similar role, rather than as an employee, (B) leased or seconded
from another employer, or (C) currently or formerly classified as exempt from
overtime wages.

visa, employment pass or other permit to work in the country in which he or
she provides services has a current visa, employment pass or other permit for
such purpose, and to the Knowledge of the Company, all necessary permissions
to remain and perform services in such country. The Company and the
Subsidiaries, as applicable, maintain accurate and complete Form I-9s with
respect to each of their former and current employees in accordance with
Applicable Laws concerning immigration and employment eligibility verification
obligations.

Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department

2.20 Customers and Suppliers.

(a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any outstanding material
disputes concerning Company Products with any customer or distributor who, in

the Company and the Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, based on amounts
paid or payable during such periods (each, a "Significant Customer"), and to

of any Significant Customer. Each Significant Customer is listed in Schedule 2.20(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has been notified in writing or otherwise by any Significant
Customer that such customer shall not continue as a customer of the Company or
any Subsidiary (or Acquirer or its Affiliates) after the Closing or that such
customer intends to terminate, allow to expire, or materially modify existing
Contracts with the Company or any Subsidiary (or Acquirer or its Affiliates).
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has had any Company Products returned

Acquirer or its Affiliates). The Company and the Subsidiaries have access, on
commercially reasonable terms, to all products and services reasonably
necessary to carry on their respective businesses, and the Company has no
Knowledge of any reason why they will not continue to have such access on
commercially reasonable terms (other than access which may be denied following
the Agreement Date as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak).

2.21 Accounts Receivables. The accounts receivable shown on the Company
Financial Statements arose in the ordinary course of business, consistent with
past practices, represented bona fide claims against debtors for sales and
other charges, and have been collected or, to the Company's Knowledge, are
collectible in the book amounts thereof, less an amount not in excess of the
allowances for doubtful accounts provided for in the Company Financial
Statements. Allowances for doubtful accounts and warranty returns have been

Person has any lien on any of such accounts receivable, and no agreement for
deduction or discount has been made with respect to any of such accounts
receivable. Schedule 2.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an

Shareholders pursuant to Israeli Law or the Charter Documents, if any, or
otherwise and any amendment or supplement thereto (other than any of the
information supplied or to be supplied by Acquirer for inclusion therein),
will contain, as of the date of the mailing of such document, any untrue
statement of a material fact, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, will omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

2.23 Company Products. All Company Products sold, licensed, leased or
delivered by the Company or any Subsidiary to customers and all services
provided by or through the Company or any Subsidiary to customers on or prior
to the Closing Date conform in all material respects to applicable consumer
protection legislation requirements contractual commitments, express and
implied warranties and to any representations provided to customers and
conform in all material respects to packaging, advertising and marketing materials and to applicable product or service specifications or
documentation, all to the extent any such warranties, representations,
materials, specifications or documentation are not subject to legally
effective express exclusions thereof. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has any material Liability (and there is no legitimate basis for any present
or future Legal Proceeding against the Company or any Subsidiary giving rise
to any material Liability relating to the foregoing Contracts) for replacement
or repair thereof or other damages in connection therewith in excess of any
reserves therefor reflected on the Company Financial Statements. The Company
Products can be legally sold and used in each geographical market in which
they are sold, used, or marketed.

6.11 Employee Matters.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.11
shall (i) confer on Acquirer or its Affiliates any obligation to make an offer
of employment or continued service to any Company Employee or Company
Contractor; (ii) guarantee receipt of any specific employee benefit or
constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any benefit plan,
(iii) alter or limit Acquirer or any of its Affiliates ability to amend,
modify or terminate any particular benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (iv) confer upon any Company Employees any third-party
beneficiary rights in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment)
or any other matter.

(b) Effective immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall terminate
the employment of each Company Employee who is listed in Schedule 6.11(b) (the
"Designated Employees") and shall use commercially reasonable efforts (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any requirement to make any
payments not yet due or payable) to enter into a legally enforceable general
waiver and release of claims with each such Designated Employee in a form
approved by Acquirer. Any severance costs related to such actions shall first
be paid from the severance deposits or reserves established by the Company
with any remaining severance costs or other related termination costs being
paid by such Company Employee's employing entity following the Closing (or if
required by Applicable Law or under applicable employment agreement to be paid
prior to Closing, shall be paid by such Company Employee's prior to Closing
and reduced in full from the Closing Net Working Capital Target).

(c) During the period on the Closing Date and concluding on the one-year
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Continuing Employee Period"), Acquirer
shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, provide each Company
Employee who continues to be employed by Acquirer or its Affiliate as of the
Closing Date (the "Continuing Employees") who remain employed during the
Continuing Employee Period with cash and other non-equity compensation that
are no less favorable, in the aggregate for each Continuing Employee, to the
salaries and benefits provided by the Company, in the aggregate for each Continuing Employee, to such Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to
the Closing (excluding for purposes of this sentence any equity-based
incentive compensation, cash bonus payments, severance and pension benefits).
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if during the Continuing Employee
Period, Acquirer or its Affiliates reduces cash and other non-equity
compensation in a manner that is generally applicable to all employees of
Acquirer and its Affiliates, the Continuing Employees shall be subject to such
reduction in a similar manner and the Acquirer will consider any existing
temporary reduction in salary which has already been implemented for the
Continuing Employees. Following the Closing Date, review of any Continuing
Employees compensation and benefits by Acquirer or its Affiliates for the
purposes of planning and implementing any changes to the Continuing Employees
compensation and benefits shall disregard any temporary reduction in salary
implemented as a result of the COVID-19 virus outbreak.

iv.As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Parent shall grant to
Continuing Employees restricted stock units covering shares of Parent's common
stock and cash retention payments, in amounts and allocations to be determined
by Parent, in its sole discretion, on the terms and conditions consistent with
Parent's equity incentive plan, as amended from time to time. Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to take the necessary steps intended for the
restricted stock units granted to the Israeli Continuing Employees to qualify
for capital gains treatment under Section 102 of the Ordinance.

6.12 Tax Matters.

(a) Each of Acquirer, the Shareholders' Agent, the Company Shareholders and
the Company shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by any of the others, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any
Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon request therefor) the provision of records and information
reasonably relevant to any such Legal Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Acquirer, the Company, the
Shareholders' Agent and the Company Shareholders agree to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until expiration of the statute of limitations of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all applicable record retention laws, regulations and
agreements entered into with any Tax Authority. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Shareholders' Agent shall have no
obligation to prepare or file any Tax Returns.

(b) Taxes for any Straddle Period shall be allocated to the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date as follows: (a) with respect to property or
ad valorem Taxes, the amount allocable to the portion of the period ending on
the Closing Date shall equal the amount of such property or ad valorem Taxes
for such entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the portion
of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (b) with respect to
all other Taxes the amount allocable to the portion of the period ending on
the Closing Date shall be determined based on an actual closing of the books
used to calculate such Taxes as if such tax period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the tax period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time). In the case of clause (b) of the preceding sentence, exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions computed as if the Closing Date was
the last day of the Straddle Period) shall be allocated between the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle
Period thereafter in proportion to the number of days in each such portion. 

(c) The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause
to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries for all
periods ending on or before the Closing Date that are required to be filed
prior to the Closing Date, shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
provide drafts of each such income or other material Tax Return to Acquirer
not less than 20 days (or less, to the extent not practicable) prior to the
due date for such Tax Return (taking into account any validly obtained
extensions of time to file), and shall make any reasonable changes requested
by Acquirer in good faith which have been submitted to the Company in writing
within 10 days (or less, to the extent not practicable) of receipt of such Tax
Returns. Acquirer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
be filed all other Tax Returns of the Company that are due (taking into
account any validly obtained extensions) after the Closing Date, whether such
Tax Returns are for taxable periods ending before, on or after the Closing
Date, including all Tax Returns for the Company and the Subsidiaries in
respect of Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods (determined
consistently with Section 6.12(b)). With respect to Tax Returns relating to
any Taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, Acquirer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the Company's past practices, except as Acquirer determines in good faith to
be otherwise required by applicable Tax law, and shall use reasonable efforts
to deliver a draft of any such income or other material Tax Return, at least
15 days and at any event at least 10 days prior to the due date (taking into
account any extension) for the filing of such Tax Return along with supporting
workpapers reasonably requested by the Shareholders' Agent, to the
Shareholders' Agent for review and comment and shall consider such comments in
good faith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without derogating in any
manner from Section 6.12(d) below, Acquirer shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to cause the Company and the U.S. Subsidiary to elect to make (and
prior to the Closing Date, Company and the U.S. Subsidiary shall not make
without the Acquirer's consent) a "Water's Edge" election on the timely filed
California 2019 tax return and short year 2020 tax return (the "Water's Edge
Election"), provided, if Acquirer does not cause the Company and the U.S.
Subsidiary to make a Water's Edge Election or withholds its consent to such
election, Acquirer shall indemnify the Company Securityholders for any Taxes
that result from the failure of the Company and the U.S. Subsidiary to make
the Water's Edge Election (determined on a with or without basis) and no
Indemnified Person shall have any right to indemnification for any Taxes
arising as a result of the failure to make such election (unless the failure
to make such election is required by Applicable Law).

(d) Parent, Acquirer and their Affiliates shall be permitted, in connection
with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to make an election
under Section 338(g) of the Code (or any similar provision of Applicable Law)
with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary other than the U.S. Subsidiary.
If such election is made, Parent shall provide written notice to the Company
Shareholders and, upon written request from a Company Shareholder also any
supporting allocation schedules. Acquirer shall indemnify the Company
Securityholders for any increase in Taxes imposed on any Company
Securityholder (or its direct or indirect owners) that result from such
election (determined on a with or without basis), and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement no Company Securityholder (or any direct or
indirect owner of a Company Shareholder) shall have any liability (determined
on a with or without basis) for (i) the breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to the extent that such breach resulted
from such election, (ii) any Indemnified Taxes to the extent attributable to
such election, or (iii) any other Taxes of the Company, its Subsidiaries,
Acquirer, or its equityholders that result from such election. The Company
Shareholders, the Company (prior to the Closing) and the Shareholders' Agent
(after the Closing), shall provide Acquirer with any information reasonably
requested by the Acquirer which is in the possession of the Company
Shareholders, the Company (prior to the Closing) and the Shareholders' Agent
(after the Closing) or reasonably available to any of them after reasonable
inquiry to make such election and otherwise comply with this Section 6.12(d);
provided that the failure to provide any such information shall not derogate
from Acquirer's indemnification obligations and releases or Company
Shareholders' rights under this Section 6.12. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, this Section 6.12(d) shall survive for the full
extent of any applicable statute of limitations. 

6.13 RandW Insurance Policy. In connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, Acquirer has obtained an RandW Insurance Policy effective as of the
Agreement Date in the form made available to Company. If for any reason
outside the control of Acquirer, such RandW Insurance Policy is terminated by
the insurance company, Acquirer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain or cause to be obtained, and the Company shall cooperate with Acquirer
prior to the Closing in order to obtain a replacement RandW Insurance Policy to
provide coverage for Acquirer with respect to Indemnifiable Damages. Without
limiting Section 6.2 and Section 6.7, if and to the extent any additional
legal, regulatory, financial or other due diligence matters are reasonably
requested by Acquirer in connection with securing such replacement coverage
after the Agreement Date and prior to the Closing, the Company shall promptly
provide such materials. Acquirer agrees that no changes shall be made to the
RandW Insurance Policy without the Company's written consent, or if made
following the Closing, without the Shareholders' Agent written consent.

6.14 Section 341 of the Israeli Companies Law; Bring-Along.

(a) Promptly after the Agreement Date and for as long as this Agreement is not
duly terminated or the Transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each Post-
Signing Shareholder, including each Company Optionholder and Company
Warrantholder who exercises such holder's Company Option or Company Warrant
between Agreement Date and the Closing Date, the Joinder Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit J (the "Joinder Agreement").
Each such Post-Signing Shareholder shall be deemed a Signing Shareholder for
all purposes of this Agreement. The Company agrees to (i) communicate promptly
to Acquirer any update to the Company's efforts to obtain a Joinder Agreement
from a Post-Signing Shareholder, and (ii) to include as a Signing Shareholder
any Company Shareholder not listed on Schedule A as of the Agreement Date who
has signed the Agreement thereafter, in each case without the need to the
consent of the Signing Shareholders.

(b) By executing this Agreement, the Signing Shareholders, who collectively
hold 95% of the Company's share capital have accepted an offer by Acquirer to
purchase their Company Shares in accordance with the terms set forth in this
Agreement, in accordance with Section 341 of the Israeli Companies Law and the
bring-along provision set forth in Section 28 of the Company's Articles of
Association as currently in effect (the "Bring-Along Provision").

(c) This Agreement shall be deemed, for the purpose of Section 341(a) of the
Israeli Companies Law and the Bring-Along Provision, to constitute (i) an
offer by Acquirer for the purchase of all of the Company Share Capital which
is conditioned upon the sale of all of the Company Share Capital and (ii) an
acceptance of such offer by all Signing Shareholders who have duly executed
this Agreement initially or pursuant to Section 6.14(a).

(d) Promptly (but in any event within four Business Days) following the
Agreement Date, Acquirer will, in accordance with Section 341(a) of the
Israeli Companies Law and the Bring-Along Provision, provide a written notice
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K (the "Bring-Along Notice") and a
Joinder Agreement to each Company Shareholder who is not a Signing
Shareholder, including each Company Optionholder and Company Warrantholder who
exercises such holder's Company Option or Company Warrant between Agreement
Date and the Closing Date (each, a "Post-Signing Shareholder"), that has not
duly executed and delivered this Agreement or countersigned this Agreement in
accordance with Section 6.14(a) setting forth the information required by
Section 341(a) of the Israeli Companies Law and the Bring-Along Provision, and
stating Acquirer's requirement to purchase such Post-Signing Shareholder's
Company Shares under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Company
shall assist Acquirer to dispatch the Bring-Along Notice to each Post-Signing
Shareholder. Acquirer and the Company shall fully coordinate any
correspondence to which each may be a party which concerns the Bring-Along Notice. Acquirer and the Company shall take such other actions as
may be necessary in order to complete the transfer of all of the outstanding
Company Shares pursuant to Section 341 of the Israeli Companies Law, the
Bring-Along Provision and under the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including in making all reasonable filings and taking such other reasonable
action which is necessary to effect the Transactions with respect to all the
Company Shares in compliance with Section 341 of the Israeli Companies Law and
the Bring-Along Provision. After satisfactory completion of the necessary
procedures under Section 341 of the Israeli Companies Law and the Bring-Along
Provision, and provided that no Order against the Transactions was issued by a
Governmental Entity that was not subsequently removed and no 341 Legal
Proceeding shall be pending before the applicable Governmental Entity in a
manner that prevents the consummation of the Share Purchase, at the Closing
the Company shall register Acquirer as owner of all the Company Shares held by
all Signing Shareholders and Post-Signing Shareholders as of the Closing
against delivery by Acquirer to the Paying Agent (in accordance with Section
1.3) of the amount in cash as fully described in Section 1.1(a) (for the
avoidance of doubt, it is clarified that Acquirer may deduct any withholding
amounts from such Signing Shareholders and Post-Signing Shareholders as
further described in Section 1.1(e)).

v.All Company Shareholders that execute this Agreement or the Joinder
Agreement after the date hereof and prior to Closing shall be deemed Signing
Shareholders by virtue of execution of this Agreement or the Joinder
Agreement, and, to the extent permitted under Section 341 and the Bring-Along
Provision, all Company Shareholders who shall have not executed a Joinder
Agreement shall be deemed Signing Shareholders by virtue of Section 341 of the
Israeli Companies Law and the Bring-Along Provision.

vi.Each Signing Shareholder represents and warrants that it has not entered
into, and agrees not to enter into at any time prior to the termination of
this Agreement, any agreement or commitment with any Person the effect of
which would violate or be inconsistent with the provisions and agreements set
forth in this Section 6.14.

vii.The Company and each Signing Shareholder shall use its reasonable best
efforts to defend any actions brought by a Company Shareholder or its
Affiliates that seeks to restrain, enjoin or prohibit the Transactions, and
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any such Company Shareholder's obligations (to the extent
that they are not in compliance therewith) under the Bring-Along Provision
and, to the extent applicable, Section 341 of the Israeli Companies Law, which
shall include the commencement of Legal Proceedings or bringing of a
counterclaim against such Company Shareholder or its Affiliates as may be
reasonably necessary or desirable in order to ensure due compliance by such
Company Shareholder of its obligations.

viii.If a non-executing Company Shareholder objects to or fails to execute a
Joinder Agreement, fails to take any actions necessary and reasonable to
effect this Agreement and the Transactions, takes any action that would result
in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of the Company hereunder, or which could result in any
of the conditions to the Company's obligations hereunder not being fulfilled
or that would otherwise impair the ability of the Company to properly and
timely consummate the Transactions, each such non-executing Company
Shareholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably appointed and constituted the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company, as their attorney in fact with full
power of substitution, to execute for and on behalf of such non-executing
Company Shareholder all instruments and documents necessary to transfer title
of its Company Shares, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter
Documents.

ix.Subject to the terms of this Agreement, following the execution of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, if the Company shall issue any
Company Shares (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be subject to
Acquirer's prior written consent pursuant to Section 5.2), then the Company shall promptly: (i) inform Acquirer of such an issuance, (ii) amend Schedule A
so that such Person will be deemed a Post-Signing Shareholder, (iii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from such holder of Company Shares,
a counter signature to this Agreement under which he, she or it becomes bound
by and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and (iv) if such a Person
does not execute this Agreement, assist Acquirer, to the extent necessary, in
the dispatch of a Bring-Along Notice to such new Post-Signing Shareholders
such that said notice will cover all of the Company Share Capital.

x.For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Shareholder" shall include
all Post-Signing Shareholders and each such Post-Signing Shareholder shall be
deemed to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, except to
the extent that doing so would be inconsistent with the provisions of Section
341 of the Israeli Companies Law or the Bring-Along Provision.

xi.Nothing herein shall be construed or interpreted so as to derogate from the
provisions of Section 341 of the Israeli Companies Law and the Company's
Articles of Association requiring each Post-Signing Shareholder to sell its
Company Shares pursuant to this Agreement.

xii.Shareholder Meeting. Promptly after the Agreement Date, the Company shall
take all action necessary under Applicable Law and the Company's Charter
Documents to give notice of an extraordinary meeting of the Company's
Shareholders, to be conducted no more than seven Business Days after the
Agreement Date, at which the Company Shareholders will be presented with and
given the opportunity approve resolutions to adopt this Agreement and approve
the Transactions. Such notice will include a statement to the effect that the
Company Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the Company
Shareholders adopt this Agreement and approve the Transactions. The Signing
Shareholders, constituting the Required Company Vote, shall vote in favor of
and support the adoption of such resolutions. Upon the Company Shareholder's
adoption of such resolutions, the Company shall deliver to Acquirer minutes of
such meeting of the Company Shareholders evidencing that the Transactions were
approved by the Required Company Vote.

6.15 Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase tail insurance coverage
under the Company's current existing directors' and officers' liability policy
in effect as of the Agreement Date (the "Tail Insurance Coverage") for the
current and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the Closing Date (the "Covered Persons"), which (i) shall provide the
Covered Persons with coverage for seven years following the Closing Date, and
(ii) contains coverage under terms comparable to those applicable to the
current directors and officers of the Company. Subject to the Closing,
Acquirer shall cause the Company and its successors and assigns not to cancel,
reduce or adversely modify the terms of the Tail Insurance Coverage and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder in accordance with its terms, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, until the seventh anniversary of the
Closing Date. The cost of the Tail Insurance Coverage shall be treated as
Transaction Expenses for all purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the Closing, until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date,
Acquirer shall, and shall cause the Company and any successor and assigns, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, to, fulfill and honor in all respects
the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
indemnification, insurance and exculpation provisions under their respective
Charter Documents or written indemnification agreements between the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries and such Covered Persons that are listed on Schedule
˝2.15(a)(viii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as in effect as of the date
hereof, to the Covered Persons as of immediately prior to the Closing to the
extent relating to claims arising from or related to facts or events that
occurred at or before the Closing Date but are asserted after the Closing
Date, provided that any such obligation shall first be satisfied by the Tail
Insurance Coverage. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing
Date, Acquirer shall, until seven years from the Closing Date, not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the Charter Documents in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Covered Persons with respect to
exculpation and limitation of liabilities or insurance and indemnification,
all of the foregoing subject to Applicable Law.

(c) The provisions of this Section ˝6.15 (i) shall survive the consummation of
the Closing, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Covered Persons (including and his, her or its respective
heirs), (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
against Acquirer, the Company or its Subsidiaries first arising after the
earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement by contract
or otherwise, and (iv) shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Acquirer, the Company or the Subsidiaries, as applicable.

(d) In addition to the Company's obligations under this Section 6.15 with
respect to the Company's current existing directors' and officers' liability
policy, if and to the extent requested by Acquirer, Company shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to purchase tail insurance coverage under
all of the Company' other claims-made insurance liability policies (excluding
the directors' and officers' liability policy, "Other Claims-Made Insurance")
to the extent that any such policy requires the insurer to make the tail
insurance coverage available or to the extent that the insurer agrees to make
the tail insurance coverage available. Acquirer agrees to pay or reimburse the
Company for the amounts paid to the insurer by the Company for such requested
Other Claims-Made Insurance tail insurance coverage.

6.16 Non-Reliance. Notwithstanding any investigation by, or right to
investigation, whether or not exercised by, or knowledge of, Acquirer or any
of its Affiliates, or waiver or non-assertion by Acquirer or any of its
Affiliates of any condition to Closing set forth in ARTICLE 7, any termination
right set forth in ARTICLE 8 or any other right hereunder (but subject to
Section 8.2), Acquirer and its Affiliates shall have the right to rely fully
upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the other
parties contained in this Agreement, including but not limited to the
schedules, exhibits and certificates delivered hereto, and shall not be
required to show reliance on any such representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement in order for any Indemnified Person to be entitled to
indemnification or other right or remedy hereunder.

6.17 Parent Guarantee.

(a) The Guaranty. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Parent hereby

undertakings pursuant to, arising under or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the obligations of Acquirer to pay
the Aggregate Consideration in accordance with this Agreement and the
obligations of Acquirer in Section 6.12(c) and Section 6.12(d) (collectively,
the "Guaranteed Obligations"), and Parent hereby represents, acknowledges and
agrees that any breach of, or other failure to perform, any such
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of
Acquirer shall also be deemed to be a breach or failure to perform by Parent,
and the Company and the Company Shareholders shall have the right, exercisable
in their sole discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies they may
have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly against either
or both of the Parent, on the one hand, and Acquirer, on the other hand, in
the first instance.

(b) Waivers of Notices and Defenses. Parent hereby waives acceptance hereof,
promptness, diligence, presentment, demand, protest and any notice not
provided for herein (including without limitation notice of acceptance,
presentment, demand, protest and notice of dishonor with respect to this
Agreement), as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by
any Person against Acquirer or any other Person and any other right or
protection to which it would otherwise be entitled pursuant to the Israeli Guarantee Law, 1967 and any regulations promulgated thereunder that
can be waived. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent hereby
waives any right to require, substantively or procedurally, that (a) a
judgment previously be rendered against Acquirer or any other Person except
Parent, (b) Acquirer or any other Person be joined in any action against
Parent, or (c) an action separate from one against Parent be brought against
Acquirer or any Person. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.17 to
the contrary, Parent shall be entitled to assert as a defense to any claim for
payment or performance of any Guaranteed Obligations that (i) such Guaranteed
Obligations are not currently due and payable, (ii) such Guaranteed
Obligations have been paid or performed in full or (iii) the Company (prior to
the Closing Date) or relevant third party beneficiary shall have expressly
released its rights to such Guaranteed Obligations in connection with a
settlement or compromise thereof.

6.18 Form 8-K Financial Statements. From the Agreement Date until Parent's
filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any amendment thereto) with the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the Closing,
the Company shall engage its auditors and otherwise use all commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare financial statements and obtain an audit report
suitable to satisfy Parent's reporting obligations under such Form 8-K (or any
amendments thereto), including the requirements under Rule 3-05 or Article 11
of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. Acquirer shall be responsible for
paying the incremental costs incurred by the Company after the Agreement Date
in connection with activities the Company undertakes solely for the purpose of
complying with this Section 6.18.

6.19 Contact. The Company and Acquirer shall each appoint an individual to act
as its point of contact (each, a "Point of Contact") to deal with issues
arising out of the performance of this Agreement. Initially the Point of
Contact for:

(a) the Company shall be Dan Glotter (Telephone: [________]; Email Address:
[________]); and

(b) the Acquirer shall be Kevin Ilcisin (Telephone: [________]; Email Address:
[________]).

Each of Company and Acquirer agrees to provide reasonable access (in person,
by telephone or electronically via email) during reasonable hours to its Point
of Contact for problem resolution. Either Company or Acquirer may replace its
Point of Contact at any time with another individual of similar seniority by
providing notice in accordance with Section 10.2.

ARTICLE 9

INDEMNITY ESCROW FUND AND INDEMNIFICATION



i.Sources of Recovery.

i.Indemnity Escrow Fund. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this ARTICLE 9, the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate
Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) for
Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the
Company Securityholders (collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties") under this
ARTICLE 9. Subject to Section 9.4, the Escrow Agent shall hold the Indemnity
Escrow Fund until 11:59 p.m. U.S. Central time on the date that is 18 months
after the Closing Date (the "Escrow Release Date"). Expect as set forth in
this Agreement, no portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, nor any beneficial
interest therein, may be pledged, subjected to any Encumbrance, sold, assigned
or transferred by any Indemnifying Party or be taken or reached by any legal
or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other Liability of any
Indemnifying Party, in each case prior to the distribution of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund to any Indemnifying Party in accordance with Section 9.4.



ii.Order of Recovery. Subject to the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE 9,
Indemnifiable Damages shall be recoverable: 

1.With respect to any claim for indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i), (ii)
or (v) (other than Fundamental Claims): (A) first, from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund until the depletion, or reservation for outstanding claims, of all
amounts then held therein, and (B) thereafter, against the RandW Insurance
Policy in accordance with the procedures, and subject to the terms set forth,
therein.

2.With respect to Fundamental Claims, (A) first from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
until the depletion, or reservation for outstanding claims, of all amounts
then held therein, (B) thereafter if and to the extent covered by the terms of
the RandW Insurance Policy following Acquirer's and Indemnified Person's
commercially reasonable efforts to recover from the RandW Insurance Policy, from
the RandW Insurance Policy, and (C) finally, if the amounts recovered in
accordance with clauses (A) and (B) of this Section 9.1(b)(ii) are
insufficient to cover Indemnifiable Damages, then from the Indemnifying
Parties in accordance with this ARTICLE 9.

3.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the amounts that
an Indemnified Person recovers from the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to
Fundamental Claims shall not reduce the amount that an Indemnified Person may
recover from the RandW Insurance Policy with respect to claims that are not
Fundamental Claims. By way of illustration and not limitation, assuming there
are no other claims for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement, in the
event that Indemnifiable Damages resulting from a Fundamental Claim are first
satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Fund and such recovery fully depletes the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, the maximum amount recoverable by an Indemnified Person
from the RandW Insurance Policy pursuant to a subsequent claim that is not a
Fundamental Claim shall continue to be the full dollar value of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund irrespective of the fact that the Indemnity Escrow Fund was used
to satisfy such Fundamental Claim, such that the amount recoverable for such
two claims would be the same regardless of the chronological order in which
they were made.

9.2 Indemnification.

(a) Subject to the limitations and exceptions set forth in this ARTICLE 9,
from and after the Closing, the Indemnifying Parties shall, severally (based
on their respective Pro Rata Shares) and not jointly, indemnify and hold
harmless Acquirer, its Affiliates, the Company and each of their respective
officers, directors, agents and employees, and each Person, if any, who
controls or may control Acquirer or its Affiliates within the meaning of the
Securities Act (each of the foregoing being referred to individually as an
"Indemnified Person" and collectively as "Indemnified Persons") from and
against any and all claims (whether or not, in the case of Third-Party Claims,
such third party is successful on the merits of such claim), losses,
liabilities, damages, fees, costs, interest, awards, judgments, penalties and
expenses, settlements, including actually incurred costs of investigation and
defense and reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, experts and other
professionals (collectively, "Indemnifiable Damages"), directly or indirectly,
whether or not due to a Third-Party Claim, arising out of, resulting from or
in connection with:

(i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Company or such
Indemnifying Party in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Schedule to
be true and correct as of the Agreement Date and as of the Closing Date;

(ii) any failure of any certification, representation or warranty made by the
Company or any such Indemnifying Party in any certificate (other than the
Spreadsheet and the Company Closing Financial Certificate), delivered to
Acquirer at the Closing pursuant to any provision of this Agreement to be true
and correct as of the date such certificate is delivered to Acquirer;

(iii) any breach of, or failure to perform, any of the covenants, agreements
or obligations made by the Company or such Indemnifying Party herein; 

(iv) any inaccuracy in any information contained in the Spreadsheet;

(v) any Indemnified Taxes to the extent not included as a Transaction Expense
that reduces the Aggregate Consideration; and only to the extent that such
Indemnified Taxes do not result in a reduction in net operating losses or
other Tax attributes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period that are available to offset such Taxes (determined assuming that any
available Tax attributes are applied to such Taxes to the maximum extent
permitted by Applicable Law and disregarding any utilization of such Tax
attributes in any post-Closing period);

(vi) fraud by or on behalf of the Company or such Indemnifying Party; and

(vii) any 341 Legal Proceeding.

(b) With respect to any indemnification claim made hereunder which is not a
Fundamental Claim, for purposes of determining whether a breach of or default
in connection with any representation, warranty or covenant (or failure of any
representation or warranty to be true and correct) exists, and for determining
the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages with respect to such breach, default
or failure, (A) all qualifications and limitations as to materiality, Material
Adverse Effect, and words of similar import, and (B) any update or
modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been
made on or after the Agreement Date, shall be disregarded.

9.3 Recourse; Limitations.

(a) If the Share Purchase is consummated, recovery from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund shall constitute the sole and exclusive source of Indemnifiable Damages
against any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement for Indemnifiable Damages,
with any further recovery to come from the RandW Insurance Policy, for the
matters listed in clauses (i), (ii) and (v) of Section 9.2(a), except with
respect to (A) any failure of any of the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Section 2.1 (Organization, Standing, Power and
Subsidiaries), Section 2.2 (Capital Structure), Section 2.3 (Authority;
Noncontravention) (but with respect to representations and warranties related
to non-contravention, solely to the extent that they refer to non-
contravention with governing documents), Section 2.10 (Taxes) or Section 2.16
(No Brokers) to be true and correct, or of the Company contained in any
certificate delivered to Acquirer pursuant to this Agreement that are within
the scope of those covered by the foregoing Sections to be true and correct as
aforesaid, (B) any fraud by the Company in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated herein, and (C) any failure of any
representation or warranty made by such Company Shareholder to be true and
correct ((A), (B) and (C) collectively, the "Special Representations" and
together with clauses (iii), (iv), (vi) and (vii) of Section 9.2(a), the
"Fundamental Claims").

(b) In the case of Fundamental Claims (a), each Indemnifying Party's Liability
(other than claims against any Company Shareholders for breaches of covenants,
representations and warranties made by such Company Shareholder hereunder)
shall be limited to such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of the amount of
any Indemnifiable Damages resulting therefrom; (b) each Indemnifying Party's
Liability shall be limited to the aggregate amount of cash to which such
Indemnifying Party is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.1; and (c)
with respect to Indemnifiable Damages for any failure of any of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 2.10
(Taxes) to be true and correct, or of the Company contained in any certificate
delivered to Acquirer pursuant to this Agreement that are within the scope of
those covered by the foregoing Section to be true and correct as aforesaid,
which were excluded from the coverage of the RandW Insurance Policy (other than
such Indemnifiable Damages which were so excluded due to the disclosure of the
underlying matter in Schedule 2.10(a) and 2.10(d)(4)-(5), of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as to which the indemnification obligations hereunder
shall apply to the same extent as all other Fundamental Claims), the
Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations hereunder in excess of the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall only apply to any Indemnifiable Damages
exceeding such Indemnifiable Damages which would have been recoverable under
the RandW Insurance Policy had such Indemnifiable Damages not been so excluded
from its coverage; provided that in the case of fraud committed by or at the
direction of such Indemnifying Party, recourse against such Indemnifying Party
shall be without any limitation and may, at the discretion of Acquirer, be
made directly against such Indemnifying Party without first seeking recourse
against the Indemnity Escrow Fund. For clarity purposes, subject to the terms
and limitations set forth in this ARTICLE 9, the Indemnified Persons shall be
entitled to recover Indemnifiable Damages for breach of the relevant
representations for any matters which are disclosed for informational purposes
only on the Company Disclosure Schedule.

iii.In the event of breaches of representations and warranties under ARTICLE 3
or in any representations, warranties or covenants in any agreement entered
into by such Indemnifying Party in connection with the Transactions, no
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any breach by any other Indemnifying
Party.

iv.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (i) no
Indemnifying Party shall have any right of indemnification, contribution or
right of advancement from Acquirer, the Company or any other Indemnified
Person with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages claimed by any Indemnified
Person, (ii) the rights and remedies of the Indemnified Persons after the
Closing shall not be limited by (x) any investigation or disclosure made by or
on behalf of any Indemnified Person prior to the Closing regarding any
failure, breach or other event or circumstance or (y) any waiver of any
condition to the Closing related thereto and (iii) the Indemnifying Parties
shall not have any right of subrogation against the Company or Acquirer with
respect to any indemnification of an Indemnified Person by reason of any of
the matters set forth in Section 9.2.

v.Subject to other limitations set forth in this Article 9, the Indemnified
Persons may only be entitled for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in clauses (i) and
(ii) of Section 9.2(a) (other than claims arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with Fundamental Claims or Sections ˝2.9(b)(i)-˝2.9(b)(xxix) and
Section ˝2.9(b)(xxxvi) ("IP Representations")), if and insofar as the
Indemnifiable Damages payable exceed in an aggregate amount of $1,000,000 (the
"Threshold"), in which event, subject to the other conditions and limitations
contained herein, the Indemnifying Parties shall be liable to indemnify the
Indemnified Persons for all the Indemnifiable Damages including the amount of
the Threshold. For clarity, the Threshold shall not apply to claims for
Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with any
Fundamental Claims or the IP Representations.

9.4 Period for Claims; Other Limitations.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 9.4, the period (the "Claims
Period") during which claims may be made (i) against the Indemnity Escrow Fund
for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with
the matters listed in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 9.2(a) (other than with
respect to any of the Special Representations) shall commence at the Closing
and terminate at 11:59 p.m. U.S. Central time on the date that is 12 months

following the Closing Date, and (iii) for Indemnifiable Damages arising out
of, resulting from or in connection with all other matters, including
Fundamental Claims, shall commence at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m.
U.S. Central time on the date that is 90 days following the expiration of the
statute of limitations applicable to the underlying matter that is the subject
of such claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, such
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund at the Escrow Release Date, less the
aggregate amount of any unresolved or unsatisfied claims for Indemnifiable
Damages specified in any Officer's Certificate delivered to the Shareholders' Agent on or prior to the
Escrow Release Date, shall remain in the Indemnity Escrow Fund until such
claims for Indemnifiable Damages have been resolved or satisfied, provided
that if no Legal Proceedings have been actually asserted against the Indemnity
Escrow Fund within 18 months following the end of the Escrow Release Date with
respect to such claims, the amounts so remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund
shall be released to the Indemnifying Parties.

(b) On the day following the Escrow Release Date, the remainder of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any, less any amounts remaining in respect of
unresolved or unsatisfied claims pursuant to the previous sentence, shall be
released and distributed to the Indemnifying Parties promptly (and in any
event within five Business Days) in accordance with each such Indemnifying
Party's respective Pro Rata Share. With respect to any amounts retained
following such distribution, such amounts shall be released to the
Indemnifying Parties based on their respective Pro Rata Shares within five
Business Days following the resolution or satisfaction of all such claims, net
of any amounts therefrom used to satisfy each such Indemnifying Party's
indemnification obligations with respect to such claims, in accordance with
this ARTICLE 9.

9.5 Claims.

(a) On or before the last day of the applicable Claims Period, Acquirer may
deliver to the Shareholders' Agent (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if prior
to the Escrow Release Date) one or more certificates signed by any officer of
Acquirer (an "Officer's Certificate"):

1.stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved or accrued,
or reasonably anticipates that it may incur, pay, reserve or accrue,
Indemnifiable Damages;

2.stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of
Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, shall
include a good faith estimate of the amount thereof, followed by an additional
Officer's Certificate when such Indemnifiable Damages are paid or incurred);
and

3.specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed
by Acquirer) the individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages included in
the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such Indemnifiable
Damages are related.

(b) No delay in providing such Officer's Certificate which is provided within
the applicable Claims Period shall affect an Indemnified Person's rights
hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Parties
are materially prejudiced thereby. Nothing herein shall impair or prohibit
Acquirer from updating or amending any Officer's Certificate within the
applicable Claims Period upon discovery of any additional facts or
circumstances with respect to any underlying claim(s) set forth therein.

9.6 Resolution of Objections to Claims.

(a) If the Shareholders' Agent objects in writing to any claim or claims by
Acquirer made in any Officer's Certificate within the 30-day period following
delivery of the Officer's Certificate, Acquirer and the Shareholders' Agent
shall attempt in good faith for 30 days after Acquirer's receipt of such
written objection to resolve such objection. If Acquirer and the Shareholders'
Agent shall so agree, and there are amounts remaining in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, a joint written instruction setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and delivered to the Escrow Agent.
Acquirer shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such joint written
instruction and Acquirer shall reclaim an amount of cash from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such joint written instruction. 

(b) If no such agreement can be reached during the 30-day period for good
faith negotiation, but in any event upon the expiration of such 30-day period,
either Acquirer or the Shareholders' Agent may commence an action or
proceeding under Sections 10.12 and 10.13 to resolve such Dispute and enforce
its rights with respect thereto.

9.7 Shareholders' Agent.

(a) At the Closing, Fortis Advisors LLC shall be constituted and appointed as
the Shareholders' Agent by virtue of the Company Shareholders' execution of
this Agreement or a Joinder Agreement and without any further action of any of
the Company Shareholders or the Company. The Shareholders' Agent shall be the
representative, exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact for all purposes in
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent
Agreement, the Shareholders' Agent Engagement Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto and thereto for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
including without limitation to: (i) execute, as the Shareholders' Agent, this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and any agreement
or instrument entered into or delivered in connection with the Transactions,
(ii) give and receive notices, instructions and communications permitted or
required under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent
Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument entered into or
executed in connection herewith, for and on behalf of any Indemnifying Party,
to or from Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person)
relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement
or any of the Transactions and any other matters contemplated by this
Agreement or by such other agreement, document or instrument (except to the
extent that this Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or
communication shall be given or received by each Indemnifying Party
individually), (iii) review, negotiate and agree to and authorize Acquirer to
reclaim funds from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims asserted by
Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person, including by
not objecting to such claims) pursuant to this ARTICLE 9, (iv) object to such
claims pursuant to Section 9.6, (v) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter
into, or, if applicable, contest, prosecute or defend, settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with Orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to, such claims, resolve any such claims,
take any actions in connection with the resolution of any dispute relating
hereto or to the Transactions by arbitration, settlement or otherwise, and
take or forego any or all actions permitted or required of any Indemnifying
Party or necessary in the judgment of the Shareholders' Agent for the
accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and
limitations of this Agreement, (vi) consult with legal counsel, independent
public accountants and other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Parties, (vii) consent or agree to any amendment
to this Agreement or to waive any terms and conditions of this Agreement
providing rights or benefits to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with
the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein and (viii) take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholders' Agent for the
accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain
the consent of any Person under any circumstance. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Shareholders' Agent shall have no obligation to act on behalf
of the Indemnifying Parties, except as expressly provided herein, in the
Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and in the Shareholders' Agent
Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of
the Shareholders' Agent in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The Shareholders' Agent shall be entitled to: (i)
rely upon the Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be
genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization
to sign on behalf of the applicable Indemnifying Party or other party.
Acquirer and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company) shall
be entitled to rely on the appointment of Fortis Advisors LLC as the
Shareholders' Agent, or any subsequent appointee, and treat such Shareholders'
Agent as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Indemnifying Party and as
having the duties, power and authority provided for in this Section 9.7. The
Indemnifying Parties and their successors shall be bound by all actions taken
and documents executed by the Shareholders' Agent in accordance with this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement the Paying Agent Agreement or the
Shareholders' Agent Engagement Agreement as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing by the Indemnifying Parties, all defenses which may be
available to any Indemnifying Party to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Shareholders' Agent
taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
Shareholders' Agent Engagement Agreement are waived, and Acquirer and the
other Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to rely exclusively on any action
or decision of the Shareholders' Agent. The powers, immunities and rights to
indemnification granted to the Shareholders' Agent Group hereunder: (i) are
coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death,
incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Indemnifying Party and shall be
binding on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an
assignment by any Indemnifying Party of the whole or any fraction of his, her
or its interest in the Escrow Fund. The Shareholders' Agent may resign at any
time. The Person serving as the Shareholders' Agent may be removed or replaced
from time to time, or if such Person resigns from its position as the
Shareholders' Agent, then a successor may be appointed, by the holders of a
majority in interest of the aggregate amount of cash then held in the Escrow
Fund (or, in the event that there is no cash then held in the Escrow Fund by
the Indemnifying Parties collectively having an Pro Rata Share greater than
50%) upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice to Acquirer. No bond
shall be required of the Shareholders' Agent.

(b) Certain Indemnifying Parties have entered into an engagement agreement
(the "Shareholders' Agent Engagement Agreement") with the Shareholders' Agent
to provide direction to the Shareholders' Agent in connection with its
services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Shareholders'
Agent Engagement Agreement (such Indemnifying Parties, including their
individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the
"Advisory Group"). Neither the Shareholders' Agent nor its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the
Advisory Group (collectively, the "Shareholders' Agent Group"), will incur
liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the
Shareholders' Agent in connection with the Shareholders' Agent's services
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement
the Shareholders' Agent Engagement Agreement and any agreements ancillary
hereto and thereto, except in the event of liability directly resulting from
the Shareholders' Agent's gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
The Shareholders' Agent Group shall not be liable for any action or omission
pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Indemnifying Parties severally (based
on such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share) will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Shareholders' Agent Group from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees,
costs, judgments, amounts paid in settlement and expenses (including the fees
and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs, all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment and in connection with seeking recovery
from insurers) (collectively, "Agent Loss") arising out of or in connection
with the Shareholders' Agent's execution and performance of this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement, the Shareholders' Agent Engagement Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto and thereto, in each case as such Agent Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Agent Loss is
finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Shareholders' Agent, the Shareholders' Agent will
reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified Agent Loss
to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If
not paid directly to the Shareholders' Agent by the Indemnifying Parties, any
such Agent Losses may be recovered by the Shareholders' Agent from the
Shareholders' Agent Expense Amount and, after it is depleted, from the portion
of the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Indemnifying Parties (and
not distributed or distributable to an Indemnified Person or subject to a
pending indemnification claim of an Indemnified Person) on the Escrow Release
Date pursuant to the terms hereof, at the time of distribution; provided, that
while this section allows the Shareholders' Agent to be paid from the
aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Indemnifying
Parties from their obligation to promptly pay such Agent Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Shareholders' Agent from seeking
any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Shareholders' Agent be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement,
the Shareholders' Agent Engagement Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Shareholders' Agent shall not be required
to take any action unless the Shareholders' Agent has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the
Shareholders' Agent against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Shareholders' Agent in performing such actions.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions
limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the
Indemnifying Parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to
be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Shareholders' Agent under
this section.

The foregoing indemnities and immunities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Shareholders' Agent or any member of the
Advisory Group and/or the termination of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the Paying Agent Agreement.

(c) The Shareholders' Agent Expense Fund will be used: (i) for the purposes of
paying directly, or reimbursing the Shareholders' Agent for, any Agent Losses
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement,
the Shareholders' Agent Engagement Agreement and the agreements ancillary
hereto and thereto, or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group. The
Indemnifying Parties will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Shareholders' Agent Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Shareholders' Agent any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in
any such interest or earnings. The Shareholders' Agent is not providing any
investment supervision, recommendations or advice and will not be liable for
any loss of principal of the Shareholders' Agent Expense Fund other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholders' Agent
is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection
with the Shareholders' Agent Expense Fund and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the
Shareholders' Agent may contribute funds to the Shareholders' Agent Expense
Fund from any consideration otherwise distributable to the Indemnifying
Parties. The Shareholders' Agent will hold these funds separate from its
corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any
other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available
to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following
the completion of the Shareholders' Agent's responsibilities, the
Shareholders' Agent will deliver any remaining balance of the Shareholders'
Agent Expense Fund to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the
Indemnifying Parties.

(d) Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Shareholders' Agent under
Section 9.7 shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction all the Indemnifying
Parties and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Indemnifying
Party; and each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon
any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every such Indemnifying
Party.

9.8 Third-Party Claims.

(a) In the event that Acquirer becomes aware of an actual or potential claim
by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim") that Acquirer believes may result in
a claim for Indemnifiable Damages by or on behalf of an Indemnified Person,
Acquirer will promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third-
Party Claim; provided that failure to give such notification on a timely basis
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure; provided further that, for purposes of making claims (or making other deliverables hereunder), written notice to the Shareholders' Agent shall be
deemed written notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.8.

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 9.8(b) and Section 9.8(c), the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Person, and to participate in, or by giving written notice to
the Acquirer, assume the defense against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any Third-Party Claim that relates to any Indemnifiable Damages
indemnified against hereunder that involves a Fundamental Claim other than
claims related to Taxes; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall
have acknowledged in writing to the Indemnified Person its liability for all
obligations with respect to such Third-Party Claim (subject to the terms and
limitations of ˝ARTICLE 9) within fifteen (15) days after such Indemnified
Person's notice of the Third-Party Claim has been given to the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party complies with the foregoing provision of this
Section 9.8(b) and the provisions of Section 9.8(c) and elects to assume the
defense against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any such Third-Party
Claim that relates to any Indemnifiable Damages indemnified by it hereunder,
it shall within fifteen (15) days of the Indemnified Person's written notice
of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the
Third-Party Claim so requires) notify the Indemnified Person of its intent to
do so; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense
of such Third-Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to
preserve its rights in this regard. The party controlling the defense of any
Third-Party Claim will provide to the other party copies of all pleadings and
notices with respect to the Third-Party Claim and will consider in good faith
any recommendation made by the other Party with respect to the defense of such
Third-Party Claim.

(c) If (i) the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim that relates to
any Indemnifiable Damages indemnified against hereunder for Fundamental
Claims, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to comply with the terms of Section
˝9.8(b) which are required in order to defend a Third-Party Claim, (iii) the
Indemnifiable Damages indemnified do not relate to Fundamental Claims, (iv)
such Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction, other equitable remedies or
otherwise involves relief other than monetary damages in respect of the
Indemnified Person or its business, (v) such Third-Party Claim involves as a
counterparty, a customer, supplier or other partner of the Indemnified Person
or any of its Affiliates, the loss of the commercial relationship with whom
would be materially adverse to the Indemnified Person, (vi) such Third-Party
Claim involves a criminal or regulatory proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation, (vii) such Third-Party Claim involves an
investigation or inquiry by any Governmental Entity, (viii) the Indemnifiable
Damages from a Third-Party Claim are reasonably expected to exceed the
coverage amount under the RandW Insurance Policy (after taking into account any
other previously resolved and/or then-pending Claims that were subject
thereto), (ix) the Third-Party Claim relates to Taxes, or (x) the Third-Party
Claim involves any Company IP, then the Acquirer (or its Affiliates) shall
have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of and to settle
or resolve such Third-Party Claim on the terms set forth in this Section
˝9.8(c). If the Acquirer defends any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall, to the extent that the Indemnifiable Damages thereunder are
indemnifiable hereunder, reimburse the Acquirer for the fees and expenses of
defending such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third-Party Claim in accordance with this Section 9.8, the
Acquirer may participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such Third-
Party Claim; provided, however, that the Acquirer shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party if based on the reasonable opinion of counsel to Acquirer,
a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Acquirer and the
Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation advisable; and
provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay
for more than one such counsel in connection with any Third-Party Claim. The
parties hereto agree to provide reasonable access to the other to such
documents and information as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third-Party Claim. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.8 to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Acquirer,
admit any Liability, permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment, or
settle, compromise, or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim on
a basis that would not include an unconditional release of the Acquirer from
all Liabilities with respect to such claim and would result in (A) the
imposition of an Order that would restrict future activity or conduct of the
Acquirer or any of its Affiliates, (B) a finding or admission of a violation
of Applicable Law or violation of the rights of any Person or wrongdoing by
the Acquirer or any of its Affiliates or (C) a finding or admission that would
be materially adverse to other claims made or threatened against the Acquirer
or any of its Affiliates. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, no Indemnified Person shall admit
any Liability, permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment, or
settle, compromise, or offer to settle or compromise, the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Shareholders' Agent shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, any defense of
the Third-Party Claim.

vi.After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time
in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the Acquirer and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually
binding agreement, in each case, with respect to any claim hereunder, the
Indemnified Person shall forward to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums
due and owing by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such matter and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, and/or instruct
the Escrow Agent to pay on its behalf, as applicable, to the extent that
indemnification is available for such sums pursuant to this Agreement, all of
such sums so due and owing to the Indemnified Person in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as applicable.

9.9 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. The Indemnifying Parties, the
Shareholders' Agent and Acquirer agree to treat (and cause their respective
Affiliates to treat) any payment received by the Indemnified Persons pursuant
to this ARTICLE 9 as adjustments to the Aggregate Consideration for all Tax
purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

9.10 Certain Additional Matters.

(a) The amount of any and all Indemnifiable Damages under this ARTICLE 9 shall
be determined net of any amounts actually recovered by an Indemnified Person
or any of such Indemnified Person's Affiliates under or pursuant to any
insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement
or contract pursuant to which or under which such Indemnified Person or such
Indemnified Peron's Affiliates is a party or has rights (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the RandW Insurance Policy, but only from and after such
time as the retention thereunder has been fully eroded) net of the out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in making such
recovery, including any premium increases under insurance policies.

(b) In no event shall any Indemnified Person be entitled to recover or make a
claim pursuant to this ARTICLE 9 for any amounts in respect of, and in no
event shall "Indemnifiable Damages" be deemed to include, (i) consequential,
special or punitive damages except to the extent such damages (1) are paid to
a third party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim or (2) involve a party's fraud,
or (ii) any loss to the extent included as a Liability or expense on the
Company Financial Statements or to the extent included in the calculation of
Aggregate Consideration. 

(c) No Indemnified Person shall have any right to indemnification under this
Agreement from and against any losses or Taxes of any Person that are due to
the unavailability in any taxable period (or portion hereof) beginning after
the Closing Date of any net operating losses, credits or other Tax attribute
from a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, other than Tax assets or attributes taken into account as an asset in
calculating Company Net Working Capital.

(d) The insurer(s) or underwriter(s) under the RandW Insurance Policy shall have
no right of subrogation against any Indemnifying Party, except with respect to
any claim that involves such Indemnifying Party's fraud.

9.11 Exclusive Remedy. Subject to Section 10.10, the parties to this Agreement
acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing, the provisions of this
ARTICLE 9 (except for disputes under Section 1.6, which disputes will be
resolved in accordance with the dispute mechanism set forth in Section 1.6)
are the sole and exclusive remedy of Acquirer and the other Indemnified
Persons with respect to this Agreement, or any other agreement, instrument or
certificate delivered hereunder or thereunder (other than the Non-Compete
Agreements and any employment agreements), and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder, under any Applicable Law, whether in
contracts, torts, restitution or otherwise, except (i) the foregoing will not
be deemed a waiver by any party of any right or remedy arising by reason of
fraud, and (ii) that nothing herein shall limit any Person's right to seek and
obtain any non-monetary equitable remedy, including a preliminary or permanent
injunction or specific performance.

signed on behalf of each of the Parent, Acquirer, the Company and the
Shareholders' Agent. Acquirer and the Shareholders' Agent may cause this Agreement to be amended at any time after the Closing by execution of an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of Acquirer and the Shareholders'
Agent.

hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto owed to such party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document

forth in an instrument in writing that is (I) prior to the Closing with
respect to the Company and/or the Company Shareholders, signed by the Company,
(II) after the Closing with respect to the Indemnifying Parties and/or the
Shareholders' Agent, signed by the Shareholders' Agent and (III) with respect
to Acquirer or any of its Affiliates, signed by Acquirer. Without limiting the
generality or effect of the preceding sentence, no failure to exercise or
delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver
of such right, and no waiver of any breach or default shall be deemed a waiver
of any other breach or default of the same or any other provision herein.

10.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being understood
and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. The
delivery by facsimile or by electronic delivery in PDF format of this
Agreement with all executed signature pages (in counterparts or otherwise)
shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto to the terms and conditions set
forth herein. All of the counterparts will together constitute one and the
same instrument and each counterpart will constitute an original of this
Agreement.

10.7 Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest. This Agreement
and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred
to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including all the Exhibits attached
hereto, the Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, (a)
constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof, including, but limited to, that certain Nonbinding Term Sheet
entered into between the parties on April 25, 2020, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its terms
and (b) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as conferring,
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder
(except that ARTICLE 9 is intended to benefit Indemnified Persons) and (c)
shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise except as otherwise
specifically provided herein.

10.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Parent
and/or Acquirer may assign its rights and delegate its obligations under this
Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or
Acquirer without the prior consent of any other party hereto; provided that
notwithstanding any such assignment, Parent and/or Acquirer, as applicable,
shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement; provided,
further, that each Company Shareholder which is a limited partnership, limited liability company or similar corporate entity may assign its rights
and obligations under this Agreement, to its partners and members in
connection with a dissolution, liquidation or sale of assets of such Company
Shareholder, or to funds managed by the same general partner (as part of a
reorganization); provided that a Qualified Withholding Certificate or other
written evidence of such assignment is provided to each Payor and the
Shareholder's Agent, such Payor shall be entitled to rely on such written
evidence absent manifest error, the transferee fills out any applicable tax
forms for the purpose of complying with any tax withholding obligations or
other documents reasonably required by the applicable Payor, and that any
costs associated with such assignment shall be borne by such Company
Shareholder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

10.9 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

10.10 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. Any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby upon such party, and the
exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise
of any other remedy conferred hereby and nothing herein shall be deemed a
waiver by any party hereto of any right to specific performance or injunctive
relief. It is accordingly agreed that, the parties hereto shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.

k.Rules of Construction; Waiver of Conflict. The parties hereto have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of
this Agreement and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement,
each Schedule and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any
Applicable Law or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document shall be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document. It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that
the Company and its Subsidiaries have retained Meitar Law Offices ("Sellers'
Counsel") to act as their counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that Sellers' Counsel has not acted as counsel for any
other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that
no other party or Person has the status of a client of the Sellers' Counsel
for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. The
parties hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute arises between
Acquirer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates and Shareholders'
Agent or any of its Affiliates, Sellers' Counsel may represent Shareholders'
Agent in such dispute even though the interests of Shareholders' Agent may be
directly adverse to Acquirer, any member of the Company's group or any of
their respective Affiliates and even though Sellers' Counsel may have
represented a member of the Company's group in a matter substantially related
to such dispute, and Acquirer, the Company and their respective Affiliates
hereby waive, on behalf of themselves and each of their Affiliates, any
conflict of interest in connection with such representation by Sellers'
Counsel. Each of the parties further agrees that, as to all pre-Closing
communications among Sellers' Counsel, any member of the Company's group, and
any Company Shareholder in the course of the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-
client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other rights to
any evidentiary privilege belong to the Shareholders' Agent, and may be
controlled by Shareholders' Agent and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Acquirer, the Company's group or any of their respective Affiliates. Acquirer
and the Company agree to take, and to cause their respective Affiliates to
take, all steps reasonably necessary to implement the intent of this Section 

10.12 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to such
state's principles of conflicts of law; provided that matters involving the
internal corporate affairs of the Company and the Share Purchase shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Israel.

10.13 Submission to Jurisdiction.

i.All Disputes shall be exclusively resolved in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction,
another state court in Delaware or the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware (the "Specified Court"). Each Party expressly and
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Specified Court, and
agrees not to plead or claim that (i) the Specified Court does not possess
personal jurisdiction over that party, or (ii) any such Dispute has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. A party that obtains a judgment against any
other party in the Specified Court may enforce that judgment in any court that
has jurisdiction over the other party.

ii.Each party hereby irrevocably appoints the designated person in Section
10.2 (excluding the persons listed immediately after the statement: "(with a
copy (which shall not constitute notice) to):") as its agent for service of
process in Delaware in any Dispute. Service of process on the designated agent
at the designated address shall be deemed, for all purposes, to be due and
effective service.

iii.Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
TO ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
DISPUTES RELATING HERETO. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.13(c).
