ARTICLE II

 

PURCHASE AND SALE

 

Section 2.01 _Purchase and Sale of the_ _Purchased Shares_ _._ Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell,
convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase
and acquire from Seller, all right, title and interest in and to the Purchased
Shares at the Closing, free and clear of all Liens other than restrictions on
transfer arising under applicable securities Laws.

 

Section 2.02 _Pre-Closing Restructuring_ _._

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to effect, or cause its Subsidiaries to effect, all transfers and take all
such actions as are necessary so that as of the Closing (i) any assets,
Contracts, rights, interests or properties of the Group Companies described in
_Schedule_ _2.02(a)_ _(i)_ (collectively, the " _Retained Assets_ ") shall be
transferred to the Retained Companies, (ii) any Liabilities of the Group
Companies described in _Schedule_ _2.02(a)_ _(ii)_ (the " _Retained
Liabilities_ ") shall be assigned to, and assumed by, the Retained Companies,
(iii) (A) the IT Assets, (B) the Business Intellectual Property Rights, (C)
any other assets, rights, interests or properties of the Retained Companies
primarily used in the conduct of the Business, in each case, except for (x)
Intellectual Property Rights, information technology

 



19

    

 assets and Contracts and (y) the assets, rights, interests and properties of
the Retained Companies access to which or use of which is explicitly governed
or explicitly required by the other Transaction Documents and (D) those other
assets, Contracts, rights, interests and properties of the Retained Companies
set forth on _Schedule_ _2.02(a)_ _(iii_ ) (collectively, the " _Transferred
Assets_ ") shall be transferred to one or more Group Companies and (iv) the
Liabilities of the Retained Companies described in _Schedule_ __ _ 2.02(a)_
_(iv)_ (the " _Transferred Liabilities_ ") shall be assigned to, and
assumed by, the Group Companies. The transactions contemplated by the
foregoing clauses (i) to (iv) are collectively referred to as the " _Pre-
Closing Business Transfers_", each of which shall be effected and implemented
on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to agreements, documents and other
instruments of transfer, assignment and assumption that are provided to Buyer
prior to the date hereof or otherwise reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (such
agreements, documents and instruments, the " _Pre-Closing Business Transfer
Documents_"). Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries or its or their
respective Representatives shall (x) implement or effect the Pre-Closing
Business Transfers other than in accordance with the Pre-Closing Business
Transfer Documents, or (y) amend, modify or otherwise make any changes or
alterations to the Pre-Closing Business Transfer Documents in any material
respect without Buyers prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b) Seller shall effect, and cause its Subsidiaries to effect, the Pre-
Closing Business Transfers in a manner that does not: (i) result in the giving
of any representations, warranties or indemnification by any of the Group
Companies to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Group
Companies); (ii) violate any applicable Law in any material respect (including
as a result of the failure to obtain any required Permit); (iii) result in any
Person, other than Seller or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries owning any
capital stock or other equity interest in any Group Companies; or (iv) result
in, or give rise to, any event, development, condition, circumstance or effect
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Retained Asset or
Transferred Asset (or any right thereunder) if an attempted assignment,
without the consent of, or other action by, any third party or Governmental
Authority, would constitute a violation of applicable Law, a breach under
such Retained Asset or Transferred Asset or adversely affect in any material
respect the rights of any Retained Company or Group Company, as applicable,
thereunder (collectively, the " _Non_ _-Assignable Assets_"). Seller or Buyer,
as applicable, shall take such actions as are set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.04_ with respect to Regulatory Approvals,  _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ with
respect to Third Party Approvals and Seller shall otherwise use, and prior to
the Closing Seller shall cause its Subsidiaries to use, commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all applicable consents required in order for
the Pre-Closing Business Transfers to occur prior to the Closing.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)_
or  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_, at the election of Buyer in writing (which
election shall be made no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date
hereof), Seller shall not transfer the assets or employees set forth on 
_Schedule_ __ _ 2.02(d)_ (such items, the " _ESOL PR Items_ ") to any Group
Company, and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect, or
cause its Subsidiaries to effect, the transfer of the ESOL PR Items directly
to, and the ESOL PR Items shall be acquired directly from the appropriate
Subsidiary of Seller by, an Affiliate designated by Buyer that is organized in
the

 



20

    

 Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (or such other Affiliate mutually agreed by
Buyer and Seller) in connection with its election. Such transfer shall occur
on the Closing Date in exchange for an amount in cash equal to the net book
value of the ESOL PR Items (other than any employees) as mutually agreed by
the Parties acting in good faith prior to the Closing Date (the " _ESOL PR
Purchase Price_ ") (which ESOL PR Purchase Price shall reduce the Purchase
Price). In the event that Buyer does not make such election, Seller shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to transfer the ESOL PR Items to a newly
formed Subsidiary of the Company organized in the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, and such entity shall be treated as a Group Company for all
purposes of this Agreement.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that (i)
Buyer will purchase all of the Purchased Shares, (ii) the assets (including
any Permitted Liens thereon) and Liabilities of the Group Companies (excluding
the Retained Assets and Retained Liabilities) will remain the assets and
Liabilities of the Group Companies, respectively and (iii) all Business
Employees who are employed by the Group Companies at the close of business on
the day immediately prior to the Closing will remain employees of the Group
Companies at and immediately after the Closing.

Section 2.03 _Purchase Price; Withholding_.

(a) The " _Purchase Price_ " in the aggregate for the Purchased
Shares shall, subject to the adjustments set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_,
be an amount in cash equal to (i) $462,500,000 ( _minus_ , if applicable, the
ESOL PR Purchase Price), _plus_ , (ii) the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, _minus_ (iii) the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness,
_plus_ (iv) the Estimated Closing Date Cash, _minus_ (v) the Estimated Closing
Date Transaction Expenses.

 

(b) Buyer (and its Affiliates) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Purchase Price such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
for tax purposes under applicable Tax Law. If Buyer determines that any
deduction or withholding is required in respect of a payment pursuant to this
Agreement, Buyer shall provide written notice to Seller no less than fifteen
(15) days prior to the date on which such deduction or withholding is to be
made with a written explanation substantiating the requirement to deduct or
withhold, and the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate to mitigate any such requirement to the maximum extent permitted
by Law; provided that no such notice shall be required with respect to
compensatory payments or if the certificate contemplated by  _Section_ __ _
2.04(c)(iv)_ is not delivered. Buyer shall promptly remit all deducted or
withheld amounts to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable Law and shall promptly provide Seller with a receipt issued by the
Governmental Authority or other reasonable evidence of such remittance. Any
amounts so deducted, withheld and remitted consistent with the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to Seller.

Section 2.04 _Closing_

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing (the
" _Closing_ ") of the purchase and sale of the Purchased Shares hereunder
shall take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 330 North Wabash Ave,
Suite 2800, Chicago, Illinois 60611, (i) on the third (3rd) Business Day
after all the conditions precedent set forth in _Sections 8.01_ , _8.02_

 



21

    

 and _8.03_ shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing ( _provided_ such
conditions would be so satisfied)) or (ii) on such other date as the Parties
may mutually agree in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless waived by
Buyer in its sole discretion in writing to Seller, in no event shall the
Closing Date occur until the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following
the Business Day on which the Marketing Period expires; _provided_ , _that_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Closing occur prior to
9:00 A.M. Eastern Time on March 31, 2020;  _provided_ _further_ , that if all
the conditions precedent set forth in _Sections 8.01_ , _8.02_ and _8.03_ have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by their nature,
are to be satisfied at the Closing) and the Marketing Period has expired (or
has been terminated or waived by Buyer) less than three (3) Business Days
prior to March 31, 2020, then the Closing shall still occur on March 31, 2020.
The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Closing Date_." Unless otherwise explicitly specified, all transactions
taking place at the Closing shall be deemed to occur simultaneously.

 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, in consideration for the sale of the Purchased Shares, Buyer shall
(i) pay to Seller the Purchase Price (prior to giving effect to the adjustment
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_) and (ii) if applicable, cause to be paid
to Seller the ESOL PR Purchase Price, in each case, in immediately available
funds by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by Seller, by
written notice to Buyer, which written notice shall be delivered not later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(c) In addition, the following deliveries shall be made prior to or at the
Closing:

 

(i) Seller shall deliver to Buyer (A) the share certificates representing
any certificated Purchased Shares duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by a
stock power duly executed by Seller for the transfer of the Purchased Shares
to Buyer and (B) a duly executed instrument of transfer as may be required for
the transfer all right, title or interest in and to any uncertificated
Purchased Shares to Buyer;

(ii) Seller shall deliver the minute and attendance books, stock ledgers
and registers and corporate seals, if any, of each Group Company (which shall
have been duly signed, revised and updated for all events up until the Closing
Date) and all other Business Records in the possession of Seller and its
Subsidiaries (it being understood that any such minute and attendance books,
stock ledgers and registers and corporate seals and other Business Records
already in the possession of any Group Company shall remain with such Person
and not be delivered to Buyer);

(iii) Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, deliver to each other duly executed counterparts to each of
the Transaction Documents (other than this Agreement) to which they are party;

 

(iv) Seller shall deliver a certification in the form of _Exhibit G_ (
_provided_ , _that_ , Buyers only recourse for Sellers failure to deliver
such a certification shall be to make any withholding pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.03(b)_ that is required as a result of such failure); and

 



22

    

(v) Seller shall deliver to Buyer duly executed copies of the Pre-Closing
Business Transfer Documents.

 

Section 2.05 _Adjustment Amount_.

 

(a) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and in
no event more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a written statement (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth (i) Sellers good faith estimate of (A) the
Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital_ "), (B) Closing Date Indebtedness, including the Aggregate Reserved
Amount (the " _Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), (C) Closing Date Cash
(the " _Estimated Closing Date Cash_ "), and (D) Closing Date Transaction
Expenses (the " _Estimated Closing Date Transaction Expenses_ ") and (ii) its
calculation of the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount. Seller shall
provide Buyer a reasonable level of supporting documentation for the Estimated
Closing Statement and the calculation thereof and any additional information
reasonably requested by Buyer and related thereto. If Buyer objects to
the Estimated Closing Statement or the calculation thereof, Buyer shall
deliver written notice of such objection to Seller no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer and Seller consult with one
another with respect to Buyers objections set forth in such objection
notice, and Seller shall revise the Estimated Closing Statement and the
calculation thereof to reflect any revisions mutually agreed upon by Buyer and
Seller prior to the Closing. If Buyer does not timely deliver such objection
notice or, if Buyer timely delivers such objection notice, to the extent Buyer
and Seller fail to resolve any of Buyers objections, the Estimated Closing
Statement and the calculation thereof as originally delivered by Seller
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 2.05(a)_ shall control.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in
any event within sixty (60) __ days thereof, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to Seller a written statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
Buyers good faith calculation of (i) the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, (ii) Closing Date Indebtedness, including the Aggregate Reserved
Amount, (iii) Closing Date Cash, (iv) Closing Date Transaction Expenses, and
(v) its calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital Adjustment Amount, in
each case, determined (x) without giving effect to (A) the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur at Closing (including
any adjustments as a result of the application of purchase accounting); or (B)
any financing transactions in connection therewith or by Buyer or its
Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) after the Closing. Except as
otherwise provided herein, the Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles and in a manner consistent with the
Sample Closing Statement. Buyer shall provide Seller a reasonable level of
supporting documentation for the Closing Statement and the calculation thereof
and any additional information reasonably requested by Seller and related
thereto. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_ is intended to be used to
adjust for errors, omissions or inconsistencies that may be found with respect
to the Financial Statements or the Balance Sheet, or any actual or alleged
failure of the Financial Statements or the Balance Sheet to be prepared in
accordance with GAAP or in good faith. Following the Closing, Buyer shall
provide Seller and its Representatives reasonable access to the records, (to
the extent involved in the preparation or components of the Closing Statement)
personnel and (subject to the execution of customary work paper access letters
if requested by) auditors of Buyer relating to the preparation of the
Closing Statement and, upon reasonable advance written notice of Seller,
shall cause the personnel of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including

 



23

    

 the Group Companies), who were involved in the preparation of the Closing
Statement (or the data reflected therein), to cooperate reasonably with Seller
and its Representatives in connection with their review of the Closing
Statement.

(c) If Seller disagrees with the calculation of the Closing Date
Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash or
Closing Date Transaction Expenses, it shall notify Buyer of such disagreement
in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such
disagreement, within sixty (60) days after its receipt of the Closing
Statement. In the event that Seller does not provide such a notice of
disagreement within such sixty (60)-day period, Seller shall be deemed to have
accepted the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Closing Date Cash and the
Closing Date Transaction Expenses delivered by Buyer, which shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such
notice of disagreement is timely provided, Buyer and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts for a period of forty-five (45) days (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with
respect to the calculations of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the
Closing Date Indebtedness, the Closing Date Cash or Closing Date Transaction
Expenses, and any resolution agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller
shall be final and binding upon the Parties and the Closing Statement shall
be adjusted in accordance with such resolution. All such discussions and
communications related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and
Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any
applicable similar state rule or evidence. If, at the end of such period, they
are unable to resolve such disagreements, then Deloitte and Touche LLP (or such
other independent accounting or financial consulting firm of recognized
national standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and Seller) (the "
_Auditor_ ") shall (as an expert and not as an arbitrator) resolve any
remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within forty-five (45) days of the date on which
such dispute is referred to the Auditor, whether the Closing Statement was
prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in  _Section_ __ _
2.05(b)_ and (only with respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to
the Auditor) whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash or the Closing Date
Transaction Expenses require adjustment. Seller and Buyer shall instruct the
Auditor to consider only those items and amounts which are identified in the
notice of disagreement delivered by Seller and which have not already
been resolved by Seller and Buyer. Further, the Auditors determination shall
be based only on the relevant books and records and the other written
information provided by Seller and Buyer ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of
independent review), and the Auditor shall not conduct additional discovery
in any form. The Auditors resolution of each disputed item shall be within
the range of the respective positions taken by Buyer and Seller.

 

(d) The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be allocated between Seller
and Buyer in proportion to the extent either Seller or Buyer did not prevail
on the disputed items submitted for the Auditors review. For the avoidance of
doubt and solely as an illustration of the methodology set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, if (i) the notice of disagreement delivered
by Seller assigns values to the disputed items such that the Purchase Price
would be increased by $1,000,000, (ii) Buyer maintains that the Purchase Price
as calculated pursuant to the Closing Statement is correct and (iii) the
Auditors final resolution of the disputed items in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.05(d)_ is that the Purchase Price as calculated by Buyer in
the Closing Statement is increased by $600,000 ( _i.e._ , sixty percent (60%)
of the amount in dispute is

 



24

    

 resolved in favor of Seller), then forty percent (40%) of such fees and
expenses of the Auditor shall be paid by Seller and Buyer shall be responsible
for sixty percent (60%) of such fees and expenses of the Auditor. All other
costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving any
dispute hereunder before the Auditor shall be borne by the Party incurring
such cost and expense.

 

(e) Except as may be required by applicable Law or court order, the Parties
agree to maintain confidentiality as to all aspects of any proceeding before
the Auditor, including its existence and results, except that nothing herein
shall prevent any Party from disclosing information regarding such proceeding
(i) to a court of competent jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing this
_Section_ __ _ 2.05_ or the Auditors final determination or (ii) in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, applied to such proceeding and the
aspects thereof, _mutatis mutandis_. The Auditor shall be bound by a mutually
agreeable confidentiality agreement, which shall preserve the confidentiality
of any proceeding before the Auditor. The decision rendered pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.05(e)_ may be entered as a judgment in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The procedures of this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ are
exclusive, and the determination of the Auditor shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Parties, absent fraud or manifest error. The date on which
the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing
Date Transaction Expenses and the Closing Date Cash are finally determined in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.05(e)_ is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Determination Date_."

(f) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, shall
mean (i) the Closing Date Working Capital Adjustment Amount (as finally
determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.05_), _minus_ the Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment Amount, _plus_ (ii) the Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness, _minus_ the Closing Date Indebtedness (as finally determined in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ _)_ , _plus_ (iii) the Closing Date
Cash (as finally determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ _)_ ,
_minus_ the Estimated Closing Date Cash, _plus_ (iv) the Estimated Closing
Date Transaction Expenses, _minus_ the Closing Date Transaction Expenses (as
finally determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ _)_. If the
Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Purchase Price shall be
increased by the Adjustment Amount (the " _Increase Amount_ "), and if the
Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then the Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount (the " _Deficit
Amount_ "). The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.05(g)_.

(g) If there is an Increase Amount, then, promptly following the
Determination Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the
Determination Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller (and/or one or more Retained
Companies designated by Seller) an amount in cash equal to the
Increase Amount in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
or accounts designated by Seller, by written notice to Buyer. If there is a
Deficit Amount, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any
event within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date, Seller shall
pay, or shall cause to be paid, to Buyer an amount in cash equal to the
Deficit Amount in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
or accounts designated by Buyer, by written notice to Seller. For U.S.
federal income and other applicable Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, any Increase Amount or Deficit Amount pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.05_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules (but subject to _Section_ __ _
11.12_), Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing (provided that the accuracy of any
representation or warranty that by its terms speaks only as of a specified
date shall be determined solely as of such date) that:

 

Section 3.01 _Existence and Power_ _._ __ Seller is a corporation __ duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate powers and all Permits
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those Permits
the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, be material to the Group Companies, taken as a whole, or the
Business. Seller is duly licensed or qualified in each jurisdiction in which
the ownership or operation of its assets, rights or properties or the
character of its activities is such as to require it to be so licensed or
qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
materially interfere with, prevent or materially delay the ability of Seller
to enter into and perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party or consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

 

Section 3.02 _Authorization_ _._ Seller has all requisite corporate power
and authority to execute, deliver and perform the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The execution and delivery and performance by Seller of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby are within Sellers organizational powers
and have been (or will be prior to execution) duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or similar organizational action or proceeding on the part of
Seller. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Seller and (assuming the due and valid execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Buyer) constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement
of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and to general
principles of equity. Each other Transaction Document to which Seller will be
a party shall be duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller at or prior
to the Closing and, upon such execution and delivery by Seller and the due and
valid execution and delivery of such Transaction Document by each other party
thereto, shall constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally and to general principles of equity.

 

Section 3.03 _Governmental Authorization_ _._ __ No consent, approval,
authorization or order of, or declaration, registration or filing with, or
notification to, any Governmental Authority is required on the part of Seller
with respect to Sellers execution, delivery or performance of the Transaction
Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, in
each case, except for (a) applicable requirements of the HSR Act and the
Exchange Act, (b) such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders,
declarations, registrations, filings or notifications, the absence of which
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect or materially interfere with, prevent or materially
delay the ability of

 



26

    

 Seller to enter into and perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party or consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby and (c) those consents disclosed in _Schedule_ _3.03_.

Section 3.04 _Noncontravention_ _._ Except as set forth in  _Schedule_
_3.04_ , subject to the receipt (or the making of, as applicable) of the
consents, approvals, authorizations, orders and other requirements set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ or in _Schedule_ _3.03_ , and except as may result
from any facts or circumstances relating solely to Buyer, the execution,
delivery and performance by Seller of the Transaction Documents to which it is
a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby do not,
and will not as of the Closing, (a) violate any applicable Law to which Seller
or any Group Company is subject or by which the Business or any property,
right or asset of the Group Companies is bound, (b) violate any provision of,
or result in a breach of, the Organizational Documents of Seller or any Group
Company, (c) violate or conflict with any provision of, or result in a breach
of, or constitute a default, or require a consent, approval or authorization
of (or the giving of notice to) any Person (other than any Governmental
Authority) under, any Contract, or result in (or give rise to the right of)
termination, acceleration, cancellation, modification or amendment of any such
Contract, or result in the loss of a benefit or increase in any fee,
Liability or other obligation under any such Contract, or result in the
creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) under any such Contract or
upon any of the properties, rights or assets of the Group Companies or the
Business, or constitute an event which, after notice or lapse of time or both,
would result in any such violation, breach, default, consent or notification
requirement, termination, acceleration, cancellation, modification
or amendment, loss, Liability or creation of a Lien or (d) result in a
violation or revocation, cancellation, suspension or modification of any
Permit, except to the extent that the occurrence of any of the foregoing items
set forth in clauses (a), (c) or (d) would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or materially
interfere with, prevent or materially delay the ability of Seller to enter
into and perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it
is a party or consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

 

Section 3.05 _Group Companies_.

 

(a) Each Group Company is an entity duly incorporated and validly existing
and, where applicable, in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite corporate or other powers and all Permits
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those Permits
the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, be material to the Group Companies, taken as a whole, or the
Business. Each Group Company is duly licensed or qualified in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership or operation of its assets, rights or
properties or the character of its activities is such as to require it to be
so licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to the Group Companies, taken as a whole, or the
Business. Each Group Company is solvent under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and is able to pay its Indebtedness as it becomes due. New
Holdco, when and after it has been formed, shall have been formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and prior to the Closing shall have engaged in no other business activities
other than those incidental to its formation in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not have incurred,
directly or indirectly, any Liabilities.

 



27

    

(b) All of the Purchased Shares are owned beneficially and of record by
Seller, and all of the issued and outstanding Group Company Interests (other
than the Purchased Shares) are owned beneficially and of record by a Group
Company, in each case, free and clear of all Liens other than, in the case of
the Purchased Shares, restrictions on transfer arising under applicable
securities Laws and, in the case of the Group Company Interests (other than
the Purchased Shares), Permitted Liens. The Purchased Shares constitute all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company. Seller is not a
party (or subject to) (i) any option, warrant, purchase right, conversion
right, right of first refusal, call, put or other Contract, obligation or
commitment (other than this Agreement) that requires Seller to sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of any Purchased Shares or (ii) any voting trust, proxy
or other Contract relating to the voting of any Purchased Shares.

 

(c) All of the issued and outstanding Group Company Interests have been
duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and
have been issued in compliance with the Organizational Documents of the
applicable Group Company and applicable Law. None of the Group Company
Interests have been issued in violation of, or are subject to, any preemptive
rights, subscription rights, rights of first offer, rights of first refusal or
similar rights. There is no existing option, warrant, call, put, right or
agreement to which any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Group
Companies) is a party or subject (or by which it is bound) that requires, and
there are no securities of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Group Companies) outstanding that upon conversion, exercise or exchange would
require, the issuance, sale, disposition or redemption, repurchase or
acquisition of any capital stock or other equity interest of any Group
Company, as applicable or the issuance or grant of any Group Company Interests
or other securities convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for or
evidencing the right to subscribe for or purchase (or requiring any Group
Company to make a payment or otherwise provide value or benefits in respect of
the value of) any capital stock or other equity interest of any Group
Company. There are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom
equity, profit participation, performance-based rights or similar rights,
commitments or obligations of any kind with respect to the Group Companies.
Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) is
a party or subject to (or bound by) any stockholders agreement, voting trust,
proxies or other agreement or understanding with respect to the voting,
redemption, issuance, sale, transfer or other disposition of the interests of
any Group Company. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
Indebtedness of any Group Company having the right to vote (or convertible
into, exchangeable into, or exercisable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which the holders of Group Company Interests may vote.

 

(d) Except for other Group Companies, no Group Company has any
Subsidiaries.

 

(e) _Schedule_ _3.05(e)_ sets forth as of January 1, 2020 (i) all items of
Indebtedness for borrowed money of the Group Companies and, to the extent
included in Transferred Liabilities, the Business, including the specific
amounts outstanding with respect to each such item and (ii) all Group Company
Guarantees and all other guarantees, letters of credit, bonds, sureties and
other credit support or assurances issued by, or on behalf or for the account
of, the Group Companies or, to the extent included in Transferred Liabilities,
the Business. True and complete copies of all such credit and support
assurances (including all Group Company Guarantees) have been made available
to Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement. Seller has

 



28

    

 made available to Buyer complete and correct copies of the Organizational
Documents (including all amendments, modifications and other changes thereto
currently in effect) of each Group Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. All of the issued and outstanding Group Company Interests are owned
beneficially and of record by Seller or the Group Company set forth on
_Schedule 3.05(e)(iii)_. Set forth on _Schedule 3.05(e)(iii)_ is, with
respect to each Group Company, (x) the jurisdiction of organization of such
Group Company, (y) the number of authorized, issued and outstanding Group
Company Interests of such Group Company, and (z) the identity of the Person
or Persons that owns, beneficially and of record, the issued and outstanding
Group Company Interests of such Group Company. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.05(e)(iii)_ , (A) there are no authorized, issued or outstanding
Group Company Interests of any Group Company, (B) no Group Company has any
other Group Company Interests authorized, issued or outstanding and (C)
neither the Company nor any other Group Company owns any shares of capital
stock or other equity interests in any Person other than other Group
Companies.

Section 3.06 _Financial Statements_ _and Other Information._

(a) Attached as _Schedule_ _3.06(a)_ are true and complete copies of (i)
the audited combined financial statements of the Group Companies and the
Retained ESOL Businesses, which comprise the combined balance sheet (the "
_Balance Sheet_ ") as of December 31, 2018 and the related combined
statements of income, parent company net investment and cash flows (and, if
applicable, of comprehensive income) for the year ended December 31, 2018 and
the related notes thereto (the " _Audited Financial Statements_ ") and (ii)
the unaudited interim combined balance sheet of the Group Companies and the
Retained ESOL Businesses as of September 30, 2019 (the " _Balance Sheet_
_Date_ ") and September 30, 2018 and the related combined statements of
income, parent company net investment and cash flows (and, if applicable, of
comprehensive income) for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2019 and
September 30, 2018 (the "U _naudited Financial Statements_ " and together
with the Audited Financial Statements, the " _Financial Statements_ "). Except
as set forth in _Schedule_ _3.06(b)_ , the Financial Statements (i) have been
prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of the
applicable Group Companies and the Retained ESOL Businesses in all material
respects (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the combined financial position and combined
results of operations and cash flows of the Group Companies and the Retained
ESOL Businesses as of the respective dates or for the respective time periods
set forth therein, (iii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with the carve-out guidelines included in SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 1.B. and (v) (x) in the case of the Audited
Financial Statements, audited in accordance with the American Institute of
Certified Public Accounts (" _AICPA_ ") standards by Ernst and Young LLP and (y)
in the case of the Unaudited Financial Statements, reviewed in accordance
with AICPA Statement of Auditing Standards 100 by Ernst and Young LLP. Prior to
the date hereof, Seller has provided to Buyer the unaudited monthly statements
of income of the Group Companies and the Retained ESOL Business, for each of
the fiscal months ending October 31, 2019, November 30, 2019 and December 31,
2019 (in the form of the schedule attached to _Schedule 3.06(c)_ ) (the "
_Unaudited Monthly Financial Statements_ "). The Unaudited Monthly Financial
Statements (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books
and records of the applicable Group Companies and the Retained ESOL Businesses
in all material respects and (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
cash flows of the Group Companies and the Retained ESOL Businesses as of the
respective dates or for the respective time periods set forth

 



29

    

 therein. This _Section_ __ _ 3.06(a)_ is qualified by the fact that the
Group Companies and the Retained ESOL Businesses have not operated as a
separate "stand alone" entity. As a result, the Group Companies and the
Retained ESOL Businesses have been allocated certain charges and credits for
purposes of the preparation of the Financial Statements. Such allocations of
charges and credits do not necessarily reflect the amounts that would have
resulted from arms-length transactions or the actual costs that would be
incurred if the Group Companies and the Retained ESOL Businesses operated as
an independent enterprise. Since December 31, 2018, there has been no
material change in the accounting methods or principles of the Group Companies
or the Retained ESOL Businesses that would be required to be disclosed in the
Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP, except as described in the
Financial Statements or the notes thereto. Neither the Group Companies nor
the Retained ESOL Businesses are parties to, or have any commitments to become
parties to, an "off-balance sheet arrangement" within the meaning of Item 303
of Regulation S-K.

(b) Seller maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting related to the Group Companies. Seller (i) maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by Seller related to the Group Companies in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and
is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) has disclosed to Sellers
auditors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information related to the
Group Companies and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the internal
controls over financial reporting.

 

(c) The books and records of the Business, the applicable Group Companies
and the Retained ESOL Businesses (i) since January 1, 2016, have been
maintained in all material respects in compliance with applicable requirements
of GAAP, (ii) are true and complete in all material respects and (iii)
correctly and accurately reflect all material dealings and material
transactions in respect of the business, assets, liabilities and affairs of
the Business, the Group Companies and the Retained ESOL Businesses. All
corporate proceedings and actions reflected in the financial books
and records of the Business, the Group Companies and the Retained ESOL
Businesses have been conducted or taken in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Laws and with the respective Organizational Documents of
the Group Companies and the Retained Companies.

(d) The minute books (or equivalent) of each of the Group Companies contain
materially true and complete records of minutes of all meetings of, or
actions of written consent by, the directors or managers (as applicable) and
equityholders, in each case, having occurred since January 1, 2016.

Section 3.07 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

 

(a) Except for actions taken in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Pre-Closing Business Transfers),
from the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, (a) the Group
Companies and the Business have been conducted in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices in all material respects and (b) none
of the Group Companies or the Business has taken any action which, if taken or
omitted to be taken after the date hereof, would require the consent of Buyer
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.01(a)(i)_, _Section_ __ _
5.01(a)(ii)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.01(a)(iii)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.01(a)(vi)_,

other than Tax elections permitted as a result of a change in Law), _Section_
__ _ 5.01(a)(viii)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.01(a)(ix)_,  _Section_ __ _
5.01(a)(xviii)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.01(a)(xix)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.01(a)(xxi)_
or _Section_ __ _ 5.01(a)(xxii)_.

 

(b) Since December 31, 2018, there has not been any event, occurrence or
development that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or materially
interfere with, prevent or materially delay the ability of Seller to enter
into and perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it
is a party or consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

forth in the Disclosure Schedules, there is no Liability of the Group

Companies prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities, debts and

operation of the Business and that are not, individually or in the aggregate,

incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents or (d) that would not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Group

sets forth, as of the date hereof, the Reserved Amount in respect of each
site and facility of the Business.

as defined in Section 280G of the Code.

any Lien (other than Permitted Liens), any Group Company Interests, or any
other securities convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or any
rights, warrants or options to acquire, any such Group Company Interests or
(B) form or cause to be formed any new Subsidiary of any Group Company or
enter into a joint venture, strategic alliance or similar partnership;

 



53

release of such Indebtedness, claims or rights among the Group Companies; or

 

(xxv) authorize, resolve, agree or commit to do any of the foregoing, or
enter into any Contract to do any of the foregoing.

For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be permitted to (i) cause each Group
Company to dividend, transfer, distribute or otherwise pay to Seller or any
of its Affiliates any or all of the Cash and Cash Equivalents (but only so
long as such dividend, transfer, distribution or other payment of such Cash
and Cash Equivalent is made prior to the Closing Date) or Retained Assets of
such Group Company, (ii) settle intercompany balances between any Group

conduct of the Business by Seller and its Subsidiaries, including through the
Group Companies.

 

Section 5.02 _Pre-Closing Access_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) give Buyer and its Representatives (including
the Financing Sources) reasonable access to the properties, books, contracts,
Tax Returns and records of the Business or the Group Companies, (ii) furnish

investigation of the Business and the Group Companies. Any investigation
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ shall be conducted (A) in accordance
with the applicable Antitrust Laws, (B) during normal business hours, (C) in
such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal conduct of the
Business or any of the Retained Businesses and (D) at Buyers sole cost and
expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (y) Buyer shall not have access to (1)
personnel records of the Business Employees relating to individual performance
or

 



54

    

 evaluation records, medical histories or other information the disclosure of
which, in Sellers opinion (in its sole discretion), could subject Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries to risk of Liability, (2) any real property owned or
leased by Seller or its Subsidiaries for purposes of conducting any
environmental sampling or testing or (3) any information to the extent
relating to any Retained Asset, Retained Liability or any Tax Return of any
of the Retained Companies and (z) Seller and its Subsidiaries may withhold (1)
any information relating to the sale process for or valuation of the Business

information to the extent the disclosure of such document or information would
reasonably be expected to violate any Contract of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or any applicable Law or result in the waiver of any
legal privilege or work-product privilege; _provided_ __ that, in accordance
with such Contract or Law, and in a manner that does not result in the waiver
of any such privilege, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall make reasonable and
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of this subclause (2) apply. Seller shall have the right to
have a Representative present at all times during any such inspections,
interviews and examinations. Buyer shall hold in confidence all such
information on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, subject to disclosures permitted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.22_.

 

(b) Seller shall promptly begin preparation of, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare in accordance with the timing and scope of work
set forth in _Schedule 5.02(b)_ hereto and deliver to Buyer as promptly as
reasonably practicable, audited combined balance sheets and the related
combined statements of income, parent company net investment and cash flows
(and, if applicable, of comprehensive income) and the related notes thereto of
the Group Companies and the Retained ESOL Business for the year ended December
31, 2019, prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto), prepared in accordance with the
carve-out guidelines included in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 1.B. and
audited in accordance with AICPA standards by Ernst and Young LLP or other
independent auditors of national standing reasonably approved by Buyer (such
approval not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld), together with
Reconciliation Statements for the statements of income; provided that such
preparation shall be at the sole cost and expense of Buyer. Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents of its auditors
with respect to the foregoing audited financial statements as may be required
by applicable SEC rules and regulations. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
delivering or obtaining the financial statements and other documents and
information contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(b)_ is not a condition
to Closing and shall in no event delay the consummation of the Closing.

 

Section 5.03 _Notifications_. Until the Closing, each Party shall promptly
notify the other Party in writing of (i) any fact, change, condition,
circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event which will or is
reasonably likely to result in such Partys inability to satisfy any of the
conditions set forth in  _Article_ __ _ VIII_ and (ii) any commencement of
or threat to commence any Action or investigation by a Governmental Authority
against (A) in the case of Seller, any Group Company or with respect to the
Business or the assets, rights or properties of any Group Company (in the
case of an Action, to the extent such Action is material) or (B) Seller, Buyer
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that either Partys
failure to give notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, to the extent
relating to a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
shall not, in and by itself, be taken into account in determining whether the
conditions set forth in

 



55

    

  _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ have been satisfied,
but instead shall, if applicable, constitute only a breach of the
applicable representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Any such
notification shall not be deemed to cure any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, including
for purposes of the indemnification or termination rights contained in this
Agreement or of determining whether the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _
VIII_ have been satisfied.

 

Section 5.04 _Regulatory Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
shall each use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable
under applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with
any Governmental Authority all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining
all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Regulatory Approvals_ ").

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer
and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) make or
cause to be made all filings required of each of them or any of their
respective Affiliates under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and on or prior to February 7,
2020, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to comply as soon as reasonably
practicable with any request under the HSR Act for additional
information, documents or other materials received by each of them or any of
their respective Affiliates from any Governmental Authority in respect of such
filings or such transactions and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection
with any such filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act with respect to
any such filing or any such transaction.

 

(c) Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the
other Party all information required for any application or other filing to
be made pursuant to the HSR Act in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party shall promptly inform the other
Party hereto of any substantive oral communication with, and provide
copies of written communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding
any such filing or any such transaction. No Party shall independently
participate in any substantive meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any such filing or any investigation or other inquiry with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without giving the other
Party prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. Subject to
applicable Law, the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
Party relating to proceedings under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



56

    

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may, as it deems advisable
and necessary, redact materials provided to the other Parties under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.04_ (i) to remove reference concerning the valuation of the
Transferred Assets or Buyers or Sellers consideration of the transactions
contemplated in the agreement, or (ii) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns. Each Party may
also reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to
the other Parties under this _Section_ __ _ 5.04_ as "outside counsel only,"
which materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside counsel of the recipient Party, and the recipient Party shall
cause such outside counsel not to disclose such materials or information to
any employees, officers, directors or other Representatives of the recipient
Party, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials. Whether or not the Closing occurs, Buyer shall be
responsible for all filing fees incurred in connection with obtaining the
Regulatory Approvals with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the actions and obligations
described in  _Section_ __ _ 5.04_ _(b)_ , Buyer shall, subject to _Section_
__ _ 5.04(f)_, use its reasonable best efforts to promptly resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR
Act. In connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in
violation of HSR Act, Buyer shall, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.04(f)_,
contest any such Action, and seek to have promptly vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, limits or restricts the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal. Buyer shall, subject to _Section_ __ _
5.04(f)_, use its reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be
required to cause the expiration or termination of the waiting, notice or
review periods under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
execution of this Agreement (but in any event prior to the Closing Date).
Buyer shall (i) at the written direction of Seller, after consultation
with Buyer and to the extent determined by Seller in good faith to be
appropriate in the context of Buyer seeking to obtain the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act as expeditiously as
possible, "pull and refile," pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12, the filing made
under the HSR Act on one (but not more than one) occasion and (ii) be
permitted, after consultation with Seller and to the extent determined by
Buyer in good faith to be appropriate in the context of seeking to obtain the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act as
expeditiously as possible, to "pull and refile" the filing made under the HSR
Act on one (but not more than one) occasion without Sellers prior written
consent.

(f) Buyer further agrees that it shall, to the extent necessary to obtain
the waiver, permit, approval, clearance or consent from any Governmental
Authority required to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.01(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)_ (to the extent such Closing
Legal Impediment arises under the HSR Act), as applicable, or to avoid the
entry of any Governmental Order that would result in, or to have lifted,
vacated, reversed or terminated, any Closing Legal Impediment, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (but in any event prior to the Outside Date) take the
following actions (each such action, a " _Remedial Action_ "): (i) propose,
negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit
to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture, transfer, license or other disposition (including by
licensing any Intellectual Property Rights) of any assets or businesses of the
Group Companies (other than Retained Assets or Retained Businesses) or any
assets or

 



57

    

 businesses of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (or equity interests held by
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in entities with assets or businesses); (ii)
propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is
accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, behavioral limitations on the assets or businesses of the Group
Companies (other than Retained Assets or Retained Businesses) or any assets
or businesses of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (or equity interests held by
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in entities with assets or businesses); (iii)
propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is
accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the termination, modification, transfer or other action with
respect to any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations
of the Group Companies (other than Retained Assets or Retained Businesses),
or Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) otherwise offer to take or offer to
commit to take any action that it is capable of taking and, if the offer is
accepted, take or commit to take such action, that limits or affects its
freedom of action; and (v) in the event that any permanent or preliminary
injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take any and
all steps, including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking
of the steps contemplated by clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.04(f)_ necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, (1) Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to take, agree to, propose, offer, negotiate or effect any Remedial
Action to the extent such Remedial Action would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Harsco
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies and after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), taken as a
whole (such material adverse effect, a " _Substantial Detriment_ ") (it being
understood, for purposes of determining whether a Remedial Action constitutes
a Substantial Detriment, that the size of the business of Harsco Corporation
and its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies and after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), taken as a whole, is that of
the business of the Group Companies, taken as a whole, or the Business) or
(2) Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (including the
Retained Companies and the Group Companies) to commit to take any Remedial
Action the consummation of which is not conditioned on the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, Buyers obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.04(f)_
shall be absolute and not qualified by "commercially reasonable efforts" or
"reasonable best efforts." The entry by any Governmental Authority in any
Action of a Governmental Order permitting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby but requiring any Remedial Action contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.04(f)_ shall not, individually or in the aggregate, be
deemed a failure to satisfy any condition specified in _Article_ __ _ VIII_.
To the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, and in connection with any
actions or effects taken by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in all
material respects in connection with its efforts to obtain all Regulatory
Approvals, including in connection with any proposal, negotiation, offer or
commitment contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.04(f)_, and with any steps
taken by Buyer to vacate, modify, or suspend any injunction or order
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.04(f)_. At Buyers request, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into and implement one or
more agreements requested by Buyer with respect to (i) any transaction to
sell, divest, transfer, license,

 



58

    

 or otherwise dispose of any assets or businesses of the Group Companies
(other than Retained Assets or Retained Businesses); (ii) behavior limitations
on the assets or businesses of the Group Companies (other than Retained
Assets or Retained Businesses); (iii) the termination, modification, transfer,
or other action with respect to any existing relationships and contractual
rights and obligations of the Group Companies (other than Retained Assets or
Retained Businesses); and (iv) any other action that limits or affects the
freedom of action of the Group Companies (other than Retained Assets or
Retained Businesses); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Retained Companies and the Group Companies) to
commit to take an of the actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) the
consummation of which is not conditioned on the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.05 _Shared Contracts_. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate with each other and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) draft and agree to a final form of each of _Schedule_ __ _ 5.05_ _(a)_
and _Schedule _ _5.05_ _(b)_ as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof and (ii) cause the Shared Contracts set forth in _Schedule_ __ _
5.05_ _(a)_ (to the extent such Shared Contracts do not
constitute Transferred Assets) (the " _Buyer Designated Shared Contracts_ ")
and the Shared Contracts set forth in _Schedule_ _5.05_ _(b)_ (to the extent
such Shared Contracts do not constitute Retained Assets) (the "
_Seller Designated Shared Contracts_ " and, together with the Buyer
Designated Shared Contracts, the " _Designated Shared Contracts_ ") to be
either, at the option of the Affiliate of Buyer or Seller that is party to
such Designated Shared Contract, (x) replaced with separate contracts (the "
_Replacement Contracts_ ") or (y) addressed by services rendered under the
Transition Services Agreement (the " _Replacement Services_ "), in
either case, that provide that, from and after the Closing, Buyer or one or
more Group Companies designated by Buyer, in the case of the Buyer Designated
Shared Contracts, or any Retained Company designated by Seller, in the case of
the Seller Designated Shared Contracts, receives contract rights and
obligations under the Replacement Contracts or Replacement Services, as
applicable, that are substantially similar, to those contract rights and
obligations under the Designated Shared Contracts utilized by Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries in the conduct of the Business or the Retained Businesses,
as applicable, as of immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for any additional costs or fees arising from and under a
Replacement Contract or Replacement Service for a Buyer Designated Shared
Contract, or in connection with any arrangement with respect thereto described
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, and Seller shall be solely responsible for
any additional costs or fees arising from and under a Replacement Contract or
Replacement Service for a Seller Designated Shared Contract, or in connection
with any arrangement with respect thereto described in this  _Section_ __ _
5.05_. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, neither Seller, with respect to a Replacement Contract or Replacement
Service for a Buyer Designated Shared Contract, or in connection with any
arrangement with respect thereto described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, nor
Buyer, with respect to a Replacement Contract or Replacement Service for a
Seller Designated Shared Contract, or in connection with any arrangement with
respect thereto described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, shall be responsible
for any Liabilities resulting from such Replacement Contracts or Replacement
Services, including any increases in pricing or other costs arising as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate and provide each other with reasonable assistance in effecting
such separation of the Designated Shared Contracts or replication of services
thereunder as Replacement Services prior

 



59

    

 to the Closing and for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days
following the Closing Date. If Buyer and Seller are not able to effect the
separation or replication of a Designated Shared Contract prior to the
Closing, then after the Closing, until any such Designated Shared Contract is
separated pursuant to a Replacement Contract or replicated as a Replacement
Service, to the extent permissible under applicable Law and under the terms
of such Designated Shared Contract, Buyer and Seller shall (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries (including, in the case of Buyer, the Group
Companies) to) (i) assume and perform the Liabilities under such Designated
Shared Contract relating to its business or the businesses of its
Subsidiaries (and shall promptly reimburse the other Party for any expenses
relating thereto incurred by the other Party or its Subsidiaries), allocated
in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, (ii) hold in trust for the
benefit of the other Party, and shall promptly forward to the other Party, any
monies or other benefits received pursuant to such Designated Shared Contract
relating to the business of the other Party (or the business of its
Subsidiaries) and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to institute
alternative arrangements intended to put the Parties in a substantially
similar economic position as if such Designated Shared Contract was separated
or its services replicated as Replacement Services as described above;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of one hundred
and eighty (180) days following the Closing, (x) no Party shall fail to renew
any Designated Shared Contract upon the expiration or termination thereof and
(y) to the extent any such Designated Shared Contract contains an "evergreen"
provision that automatically renews such Designated Shared Contract unless
terminated or cancelled by either party thereto, the applicable Party shall
not terminate or cancel such Designated Shared Contract as permitted pursuant
to the terms thereof, in each case, without the prior written consent of
Buyer or Seller, as applicable. Buyer shall be solely responsible for
replacing any Buyer Designated Shared Contracts, as well as any other Shared
Contracts that are not Transferred Assets or that are Retained Assets, to the
extent such Shared Contracts are not separated or services replicated as
described above prior to the Closing. Seller shall be solely responsible for
replacing any Seller Designated Shared Contracts, as well as any other Shared
Contracts that are Transferred Assets or that are not Retained Assets, to the
extent such Shared Contracts are not separated or services replicated as
described above prior to the Closing. With respect to Liabilities under or
resulting from a given Designated Shared Contract, such Liabilities shall,
unless otherwise allocated pursuant to this Agreement or a Replacement
Contract or Replacement Service, be allocated from time to time between the
Retained Companies, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Group Companies, on the
other hand, as the case may be, based on the relative proportions of total
benefits received (to the extent the Liabilities relate to a specific period,
over such period, and otherwise over the term of such Designated Shared
Contract, measured up to the date of the allocation, without duplication) by
the Retained Companies, on the one hand, or Buyer and the Group Companies, on
the other hand, under such Designated Shared Contract. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Party shall be solely responsible for any and all Liabilities
to the extent arising out of or relating to such Partys (or its
Subsidiaries) breach of such Designated Shared Contract. It is acknowledged
that for the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, what constitutes
"substantially similar" shall be determined after taking into account changes
in volume and similar pricing metrics, as well as the needs of the applicable
Party.

 

Section 5.06 _Third Party Approvals_.

 

(a) Except with respect to Regulatory Approvals (which are addressed in
_Section_ __ _ 5.04_) and the Shared Contracts (which are addressed in
_Section_ __ _ 5.05_), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
prior to the Closing Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries

 



60

    

 to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents, waivers,
approvals, orders and authorizations necessary to transfer and assign
the Non-Assignable Assets (the " _Third Party Approvals_ ") effective as of
the Closing. To the extent that any Third Party Approval has not been obtained
prior to the Closing, until the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Third Party Approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Party shall be required to incur any
Liabilities, or provide any financial accommodation, in order to obtain any
such Third Party Approval with respect to the transfer or assignment of any
Non-Assignable Asset for the benefit of the Party to whom such Non-Assignable
Asset is contemplated to be transferred under this Agreement (the " _Receiving
Party_ "), (ii) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
commit to make any payments other than cash payments that are either (x) paid
in full prior to the Closing or (y) _ de minimis_ administrative fees or _de
minimis_ reimbursement obligations or (iii) each Party shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to make any non-monetary concessions that would
purport to bind, following the Closing, the other Party, its Affiliates or, in
the case of Buyer, the Business or, in the case of Seller, the Retained
Business.

(b) In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of
the Non-Assignable Asset, in the event any Third Party Approval has not been
obtained by the Closing, the applicable other Party (the " _Transferring
Party_ ") shall hold in trust for the benefit of the Receiving Party such
Non-Assignable Asset and shall promptly forward to the Receiving Party, any
monies or other benefits received pursuant to such Non-Assignable Asset, in
each case, until such time as the Third Party Approval is obtained, but in no
event longer than twelve (12) months after the Closing Date. For the period
beginning on the Closing Date and not to exceed twelve (12) months after
the Closing Date, the Transferring Party shall comply with all applicable
covenants and obligations under the Non-Assignable Assets, including the
payment of any costs or expenses in connection therewith, which shall be
performed by the Transferring Party for the Receiving Partys account and the
Receiving Party shall promptly (but in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days following receipt of an invoice from the Transferring Party)
reimburse the Transferring Party for any out-of-pocket costs, expenses or
payments made by the Transferring Party in respect of such Non-Assignable
Asset. For the period beginning on the Closing Date and not to exceed twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by Law and the
terms of the Non-Assignable Asset, (i) the Receiving Party shall be entitled
to receive all of the benefits of the Transferring Party under the Non-
Assignable Assets and (ii) the Transferring Party and the Receiving Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to institute alternative
arrangements intended to put the Receiving Party in a substantially similar
economic position as if such Non-Assignable Asset was transferred and
assigned as described above. After the Closing, the Receiving Party shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Transferring Party and its Affiliates,
Representatives, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all
Liabilities based upon, arising out of or relating to the performance of, or
failure to perform, any obligations under the Non-Assignable Assets that are
for the benefit of the Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a
period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, a Transferring Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to renew for a period of time until
at least the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Closing Date any Non-
Assignable Asset upon the expiration or termination thereof and shall not, to
the extent that any Non-Assignable Asset contains an "evergreen" provision
that automatically renews such Non-Assignable Asset unless terminated or
cancelled by either party thereto, terminate or cancel such Non-Assignable
Asset pursuant to the terms thereof, in each case, without the Receiving
Partys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, 

 



61

    

 conditioned or delayed). Once a Third Party Approval described in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.06_ is obtained from, or such other action described in
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ is taken by, such third party, the applicable
Non-Assignable Assets shall be deemed to have been automatically assigned and
transferred to (x) a Retained Company designated by Seller in the case of
Retained Assets or (y) a Group Company designated by Buyer in the case of the
Transferred Assets, in each case, on the terms set forth in this Agreement, as
of immediately prior to the Closing, for no additional consideration.

Section 5.07 _Post-Closing Asset Transfers_. In the event that at
any time or from time to time after the Closing Date, the Retained Companies
receive or otherwise possess any Transferred Asset or other property, right or
asset (including Cash and Cash Equivalents) that relate to the Business or
should belong to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, Seller shall promptly
transfer, or cause to be transferred, such asset to Buyer or one or more of
its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) designated by Buyer, for no
additional consideration and net of the Retained Companies reasonable out-
of-pocket costs to effectuate such transfer, and to the extent such asset is
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Seller shall provide a general explanation or
description of such transfer. Prior to any such transfer, Seller shall hold
such asset in trust for the benefit of Buyer and shall promptly forward to
Buyer any monies or other benefits received pursuant to such
Transferred Asset or other property, right or asset. In the event that at any
time or from time to time after the Closing Date, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, including the Group Companies, receives or otherwise possesses any
Retained Asset or other property or asset (including Cash and Cash
Equivalents) that relate to the Retained Businesses or should belong to any of

transfer, or cause to be transferred, such asset to the appropriate Retained
Company, designated by Seller, for no additional consideration and net of
Buyers reasonable out-of-pocket costs to effectuate such transfer, and to
the extent such asset is Cash and Cash Equivalents, Buyer shall provide a
general explanation or description of such transfer. Prior to any such

Section 5.09 _Group Company Guarantees_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (and Seller shall
cooperate with the reasonable requests of Buyer) to obtain from the
respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Seller, on or before the Closing Date, valid and binding written unconditional
releases of the Retained Companies, as applicable, from their respective
obligations under the Group Company Guarantees set forth on _Schedule_
_3.05(e)_ and any Group Company Guarantees entered into or issued after the
date hereof in accordance with this Agreement (true and complete copies of
which shall be provided to Buyer promptly upon entering into or issuing such
Group Company Guarantee), which shall be effective as of the Closing,
including by furnishing letters of credit, instituting escrow arrangements,
posting surety or performance bonds or making other arrangements as the
counterparty may reasonably request.

(b) If any Group Company Guarantee has not been fully and unconditionally
released as of the Closing, (i) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to terminate, or, if the Parties
are unable to so terminate, cause Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries to be
substituted in all respects for any Retained Company in respect of, all
obligations under such Group Company Guarantees, (ii) unless Seller has
materially breached its obligations under the immediately preceding
clause (i), Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Retained
Companies for any Damages that Seller or any Retained Company may incur under
any such Group Company Guarantees, including any claim or demand for payment
made on any Retained Company under, and any fees in connection with the
issuance and maintenance of, any letters of credit or surety or performance
bonds (in each case, if applicable, in proportion to the amount relating to
the Business relative to any amount not relating to the Business) and (iii)
Buyer shall not permit any of the Group Companies to (A) renew or extend the
term of, (B) increase its obligations under or (C) transfer to another third
party, any loan, Contract or other obligation for which any Retained Company
is, or would reasonably be expected to be, liable under such Group Company
Guarantee. To the extent that the Retained Companies have performance
obligations under any Group Company Guarantee, Buyer will, and will cause the
Group Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) perform such
obligations on behalf of the Retained Companies or (y) otherwise take such
action as reasonably requested by Seller so as to put the Retained Companies
in the same position as if Buyer and the Group Companies, and not a Retained
Company, had performed or were performing such obligations.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that at any time on or after the Closing Date, none of
the Retained Companies will have any obligation to renew any letters of credit
or surety or performance bonds issued on behalf of any Group Company or the
Business after the expiration of any such letters of credit or surety
or performance bonds.

Section 5.10 _Use of Retained Marks_ _._ __

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_, Buyer and its
Affiliates have, and after the Closing, the Group Companies shall have, no
right, title, interest, license or any other right whatsoever in the Retained
Marks, and none of the Retained Companies have, pursuant to the Transaction
Documents, assigned such right, title, interest, license or other right to
Buyer, its Affiliates or the Group Companies. For clarity, nothing shall
restrict Buyer, its

 



63

    

 Affiliates or the Group Companies from using or referencing the Retained
Marks in (i) a non-trademark manner to describe or provide information
regarding the history of the Business, (ii) a manner that would constitute
"fair use" under applicable Law or (iii) as required by applicable Law. After
the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates (including the Retained Companies)
shall have, no right, title, interest, license or any other right whatsoever
in the Owned Business Intellectual Property Rights, and none of the Group
Companies have, pursuant to the Transaction Documents, assigned such right,
title, interest, license or other right to Seller, its Affiliates or the
Retained Companies. At Buyers request, for one hundred and eighty (180) days
after the Closing, Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) maintain a
statement and a link on Sellers website www.stericycleenvironmental.com,
which previously referenced the Business, in a mutually agreeable form,
directing customers to a website designated by Buyer with respect to the
Business.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) months following the Closing Date, Buyer and
the Group Companies shall have the right to continue to use the marketing and
promotional materials, invoices, business cards, schedules, displays, signs,
stationery, technical guidelines, product manuals, packing materials, and
other supplies and materials (" _Materials_ "), that were previously created
that incorporate the Retained Marks, solely in the manner such Materials were
used in the Business prior to Closing and solely to the extent that Buyer and
the Group Companies maintain the quality of the goods and services associated
with the Retained Marks ( _provided_ , that in the case of Retained Marks used
on vehicles, Buyer and the Group Companies shall have the right to continue to
use the Retained Mark for a period of nine (9) months following the Closing
Date); _provided_ , _however_ , that as promptly as practicable after Closing,
but in no event after the conclusion of such six (6) month or nine (9) month
period, as applicable, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Group Companies to,
cease and discontinue any use of the Retained Marks and, at Buyers sole cost
and expense, remove all Retained Marks from all such supplies and materials,
in each case, whether such supplies or materials are held by Buyer or
the Group Companies or under the control of Buyer or the Group Companies.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer inadvertently uses a Retained
Mark (other than a Trademark with the name "Stericycle"), Seller shall provide
written notice to Buyer, and Buyer will not be considered to be in breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ so long as Buyer takes the actions specified in
_Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_, provided that for this purpose the compliance period
shall begin running on the date of the notice rather than the Closing Date.

 

(d) As promptly as practicable after the Closing but in no event later than
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Group Companies to, at Buyers sole cost and expense, to file to change the
names of the Group Companies to remove the word "Stericycle" or any
confusingly similar derivation or translation thereof, including filings with
the applicable Governmental Authority of each jurisdiction in which the
ownership or the operation of the Group Companies assets or the character of
its activities is such as to require it to be licensed or qualified in such
jurisdiction.

 



64

    

(e) Effective as of the Closing Date:

 

(i) Seller, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries (other than the Group
Companies) (the " _Seller Covenant Parties_ "), hereby covenants to Buyer
that none of the Seller Covenant Parties shall bring any proceeding against
the Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) anywhere in the
world that alleges that their current and future operation of the Business
infringes any patents, trade secrets, inventions, know-how, methods or
processes (" _Inventions_ ") that in each case are (i) owned by the Seller
Covenant Parties as of the Closing Date and (ii) were used in the Business as
of the Closing Date or at any time during the twelve (12) month period prior
to the Closing Date.

 

(ii) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries (including the Group
Companies, the " _Buyer Covenant Parties_ ") hereby covenants to the Seller
Covenant Parties that none of the Buyer Covenant Parties shall bring any
proceeding against any of the Seller Covenant Parties anywhere in the world
that alleges that the current and future operation of the Retained Business
infringes any Inventions that are (i) included in the Transferred Assets or
owned by the Group Companies or Buyer as of the Closing Date and (ii) were
used in the Retained Business as of the Closing Date. 

(iii) The above covenants extend to the contractors, service providers,
distributors, resellers and end-users of the applicable Seller Covenant
Parties or the Buyer Covenant Parties, as applicable, with respect to the
covered businesses of the Seller Covenant Parties or Buyer Covenant Parties,
as applicable, but not with respect to other products or services of such
third parties.

(iv) The Parties intend and agree that, for purposes of Section 365(n) of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (and any amendment thereto) and any equivalent Law in
any foreign jurisdiction, each of the above covenants will be treated as a
license to intellectual property (as defined in Section 101(35A) of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code).

(v) The above covenants are intended to run with the Inventions subject to
such covenant. Each Party may and must transfer its covenant granted to the
other Party, in whole or in part, to the successor or acquirer of any
Inventions subject thereto, and such successor or acquirer shall assume its
obligations in writing or by operation of Law. Further, any such successor or
acquirer is deemed automatically bound by such covenant, regardless of whether
such successor or acquirer executes such written assumption. Each Party
may transfer the covenant granted to such Party by the other Party, in whole
or in part, in connection with the sale of any business to which the covenant
relates (or a merger, reorganization or equity sale of any entity owning
same), provided that the covenant will not extend to any acquirers other
businesses.

Section 5.11 _Insurance_.

 

(a) On and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as
are reasonably necessary to ensure that the Group Companies will be able to
benefit from all material coverage which is available to the Group Companies
as of the Closing Date under the insurance policies of the Retained Companies
with respect to events which have occurred, conditions which are in existence,
claims which are made, or occurrences which are reported prior to or on the
Closing Date on all occurrence-based (but not claims-made or occurrence-
reported (other than with respect to claims which are made or occurrences
which are reported prior to the Closing Date)) insurance policies of the
Retained

 



65

    

 Companies to the extent such claims relate to events which have occurred,
conditions which are in existence, claims which are made, or occurrences which
are reported prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall give Buyer or its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Group Companies) any right to any Retained Assets
related to any insurance policies.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Group Companies) not to, assert
any right, claim or interest to or under any insurance policies of the
Retained Companies (excluding any Insurance Policies) or rights to proceeds
thereof in effect on or prior to the Closing Date relating to the Group
Companies, other than in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_.

(c) From and after the Closing, with respect to any claim or occurrence
relating to the Group Companies, Business Employees or former employees of the
Group Companies that would be covered by any of the Retained Companies
occurrence-based (but not claims-made or occurrence-reported (other than with
respect to claims which are made or occurrences which are reported prior to
the Closing Date)) insurance policies (such policies, the " _Available
Insurance_ _Policies_ " and such claims, the " _Coverage Claims_ "), Buyer,
on behalf of the Group Companies, may access, submit claims and seek coverage
for such Coverage Claims under the Available Insurance Policies, subject to
the terms and conditions of such Available Insurance Policies; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Buyer shall exclusively bear the amount of any
"deductibles" associated with claims under such Available Insurance Policies
and shall otherwise be liable for all uninsured or uncovered amounts of such
claims (except to the extent Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Article_ __ _ IX_), (ii) the Group Companies shall be solely responsible at
their expense for notifying any and all insurance companies of such claims
and complying with all policy terms and conditions for pursuit and collection
of such claims and shall not, without the written consent of Seller, amend,
modify or waive any rights of Seller or other insureds under any such
insurance policies and programs, (iii) with respect to Coverage Claims or
requests for benefits asserted by the Group Companies under the Available
Insurance Policies, Seller shall have the right but not the duty to monitor
and/or associate with such claims, (iv) the Group Companies shall be liable
for any fees, costs or expenses incurred by Seller directly or indirectly
through the insurers or reinsurers of the Available Insurance Policies
relating to any unsuccessful coverage claims and (v) the Group Companies
shall not assign any Available Insurance Policies or any rights or claims
under the Available Insurance Policies. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein, (x) nothing in this Agreement shall limit, waive or abrogate in any
manner any rights of Seller to insurance coverage for any matter, whether
relating to the Group Companies or otherwise, and (y) Seller shall retain the
exclusive right to control all of their insurance policies and programs,
including the Available Insurance Policies, including the right to exhaust,
settle, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect
to any of its insurance policies (other than disputes relating to the Group
Companies) and to amend, modify, terminate or waive any such insurance
policies and programs or any rights thereunder; _provided_ , that Seller shall
not amend, modify, terminate or waive any coverage under any Available
Insurance Policies with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date in a
manner that would impair coverage thereunder available for Coverage Claims or
otherwise limit the rights of Buyer under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and the Group
Companies with respect to Coverage Claims and requests for benefits asserted
by Buyer on behalf of the Group Companies under the Available Insurance
Policies and Seller shall provide Buyer such information as is reasonably
necessary to submit claims and seek coverage for any Coverage Claims under the
Available Insurance Policies. 

 



66

    

(d) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall limit, modify or in any
way affect the rights and obligations of the Parties under _Article_ __ _
IX_; _provided_ , _however_ , that any insurance proceeds actually collected
with respect to a particular set of Damages shall be taken into account under
and to the extent required by _Article_ __ _ IX_. No payments due under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall affect, be affected by, or be subject to set off
against, any adjustment to Purchase Price. Whenever this _Section_ __ _
5.11_ requires any Group Company to take any action after the Closing, such
requirement shall be deemed to constitute an undertaking on the part of Buyer
to take such action or to cause such Group Company to take such action.

(e) If and to the extent Seller or its Affiliates actually incur out-of-
pocket costs in connection with providing Buyer or its Affiliates (including,
from an after the Closing, the Group Companies) with any benefit under this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.11_ or the insurance policies referenced herein, Buyer shall
promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) reimburse Seller for
such costs upon presentation of evidence of such costs being so incurred.

Companies) are named as parties to any Action with respect to a Liability of a
Group Company, in order to settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to, any such Action, Seller and Buyer, and their
respective Subsidiaries, must comply with the provisions of _Section_ __ _
9.05_ instead of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ with respect to such settlement,
compromise or consent.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to make available

consultation and interviews and as witnesses to the extent that any such
individual may reasonably be required in connection with any Actions in which
the requesting Party may from time to time be involved relating to the conduct
of the Business or the Retained Businesses prior to or after the
Closing. Access to such Persons shall be granted during normal business hours
at a location and in a manner reasonably calculated to minimize disruption to
such individuals, the Business and the Retained Businesses, as applicable.
Seller and Buyer agree to reimburse each other for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including attorneys fees, but excluding officers or employees
salaries or other wages, incurred by any other Party in connection with
providing individuals and witnesses pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions in _Article_ __ _ VI_
shall govern with respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision
in _Article_ __ _ VI_ is in conflict with _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, no Party shall have an
obligation to cooperate, make available personnel or disclose any documents or
other information pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_, _Section_ __ _
5.12(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 5.13(b)_ or _Article_ __ _ VI_, if Seller or any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, are adverse parties in any Action and such assistance, testimony,
documents or other information is reasonably pertinent

 



67

    

 thereto; _provided_ that, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(c)_ shall
limit in any respect any rights a Party may have with respect to discovery or

(e) Seller acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ and elsewhere in this Agreement were a
material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. Seller hereby acknowledges that the
restrictive covenants set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ and elsewhere in
this Agreement are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area
restrictions and are necessary to protect the goodwill of the Business and to
prevent the impairment of the value of the substantial investment therein

competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment determines that
a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a specified business
limitation or any other relevant element of this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ or
other restrictive covenant in this Agreement is unreasonable, arbitrary or
against public policy, then a lesser time period, geographical area, business
limitation or other relevant element which is determined by such court to be
reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced
against the applicable party. Seller acknowledges that a remedy at Law for
any breach or attempted breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ may be inadequate
and further agrees that any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ may result in
irreparable harm to Buyer or the Group Companies, and Buyer may, in addition
to any other remedy that may be available to it, be entitled to specific
performance and injunctive and other equitable relief in case of any such

its Subsidiaries, concerning the transactions contemplated hereby without the

restriction shall not prohibit any contacts or communications by Buyer or
its representatives or Affiliates with such employees, customers, suppliers
or licensors in the ordinary course and unrelated to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

received by way of payment in cash, or credit, offset or reduction in Tax
Liability received in lieu of receipt of a refund) of Taxes (and interest
thereon paid by the Taxing Authority) of or attributable to any of the Group
Companies that is (i) attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (ii)
otherwise attributable to any other Taxes paid, indemnified or otherwise borne
by Seller or any predecessor or Affiliate of Seller (including, for taxable
periods or portions thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the Group
Companies). Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
claim and receive any such refund to which Seller would be entitled pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)_ if reasonably requested by Seller,
including by taking any action reasonably requested by Seller to obtain any
such refund promptly, and shall pay any refunds received (net of Taxes or
other costs incurred by the Group Companies or their Affiliates in connection
with receipt of such refund) to Seller by the end of the calendar quarter in
which such refunds are actually

 



80

    

 received in cash or actually applied to reduce a Tax Liability (and for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not be required to make payments more frequently
than once per calendar quarter). Buyer agrees to waive any carryback of any
Tax loss or other Tax attribute from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and to instead carry forward such loss or other attribute
to a Post-Closing Tax Period, if and to the extent permitted by applicable
Tax Law. With respect to refunds of Taxes other than Income Taxes, Seller
shall not be entitled to any amounts pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)_
that are received after the termination of the indemnities described in
_Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)(iv)_ with respect to
Taxes other than Income Taxes (as extended to resolve any pending claims
thereunder).

 

(c) Except as shall arise from the Pre-Closing Business Transfers (which
shall be borne and timely paid by Seller), all excise, sales, use, value
added, registration stamp, recording, documentary, conveyancing, franchise,
property, transfer, and similar Taxes, levies, charges and fees arising from
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (collectively, the
" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne and timely paid by Buyer, and Buyer shall
promptly reimburse Seller for any Transfer Taxes which Seller is required to
pay under applicable Law. In addition, Buyer shall prepare and timely file,
or cause to be prepared and timely filed, at its expense, all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

 

(d) In the case of any Straddle Tax Period, (i) real, personal and
intangible property Taxes and any other similar Taxes levied on a per diem
basis of any Person for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount
of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Tax Period that
are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in the Straddle Tax Period and (ii) any other Taxes of
any Person for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such Tax
period ended on the Closing Date.

 

(e) Seller shall make an election under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i) to avoid attribute reduction under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-36(d)(2). Upon request of Buyer, Seller shall
provide reasonable evidence that such election was made (but shall not be
required to share any Tax Returns of a Retained Company).

 

Section 6.02 _Cooperation on_ _Tax_ _Matters_ _._ Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate fully, and Buyer shall cause each of its Subsidiaries,
including the Group Companies, to cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the applicable other Party, in connection with the
preparation, execution and filing of Tax Returns and any audit, examination,
inquiry, assessment, claim for refund, lawsuit, action, claim, arbitration,
mediation or other proceeding at law or in equity by or before a Taxing
Authority with respect to Taxes relating to the Group Companies (each a "
_Tax Claim_ ") and any other Tax, escheat or unclaimed property matters
(including any Unclaimed Property Claims) pursuant to this Agreement. Such
cooperation shall include access to records and information which
are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, Tax Claim or Unclaimed
Property Claim, making personnel available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder, executing Tax Returns and executing powers of attorney. The party
requesting such cooperation shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of
the other party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Seller may retain copies of all information and records of the Group Companies
relating to Taxes or escheat or unclaimed property matters.

 



81

    

Section 6.03 _Buyer_ _Covenants_ _. _

(a) Except as required by Law, Buyer covenants that it shall not nor shall
it cause or permit any Group Company or any Affiliate of Buyer to (i) take
any action on the Closing Date outside the ordinary course of business that is
not otherwise specifically contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) make any Tax
election (including any election under Section 338 of the Code) that would be
effective for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portions of any Straddle Tax
Periods ending on or before the Closing Date, (iii) except for Tax
Returns filed in accordance with _Section 6.01(a)_, amend, file, refile,
revoke or otherwise modify (or cause to be amended, filed, refiled, revoked or
otherwise modified) any Tax Return of the Group Companies relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Tax Periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, (iv) file (or cause to be filed) a ruling request
with any Taxing Authority that relates to the Taxes or Tax Returns of the
Group Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle
Tax Periods ending on or before the Closing Date, (v) initiate (or cause to be
initiated) any voluntary disclosure or similar proceedings with any Taxing
Authority regarding any Tax or Tax Return of the Group Companies for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period of the portion of any Straddle Tax Periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, or (vi) take any action (or cause to be taken any
action) to extend the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any
Tax Return of the Group Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or any
Straddle Tax Period, in each case, without the prior written consent of Seller
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
any action described in clauses (i) through (vi) above could result in any
non- _de minimis_ Liabilities to Seller and/or its Affiliates (including a non
_-de minimis_ indemnity obligation under Article IX) such Liabilities
shall constitute a reasonable basis for the withholding of consent; provided,
further, that Seller may withhold consent to any action described in clauses
(i) through (vi) above arising out of or relating to the Combined Tax Position
with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Tax Periods (except to the
extent such action is taken in accordance with Section 6.01 or Section 6.05).

 

(b) Nothing in this _Section 6.03_ shall prohibit Buyer from taking any of
the actions described in this  _Section 6.03_ with respect to a Tax period
beginning following the Closing Date (which may include filing on a basis
inconsistent with the Combined Tax Position for any such period); _provided_
that until the termination of the indemnities described in _Section
9.02(a)(i)_ and _Section 9.02(a)(iv)_ with respect to Taxes other than Income
Taxes (as extended to resolve any pending claims thereunder), (i) Buyer shall
deliver to Seller the initial Tax Return (including any registration form)
for each Group Company that is filed with respect to a Tax period beginning
following the Closing on a basis inconsistent with the Combined Tax Position
reasonably in advance of the date such Tax Return is due and (ii) Buyer shall
incorporate any reasonable comments received from Seller in writing reasonably
thereafter (provided that all such comments must be received prior to the due
date of such Tax Return) (but for the avoidance of doubt shall not be
required to incorporate any comments that would have a non- _de minimis_
adverse effect on Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Group Companies
following the Closing)).

 

Section 6.04 _Tax Sharing_ _Agreements_ _._ Any and all existing Tax
sharing, Tax allocation or Tax indemnity agreements, except for this
Agreement, between any Group Company, on the one hand, and any Retained
Company, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date to the
extent they relate to the Group Companies. 

 



82

    

Section 6.05 _Tax Claims_.

 

(a) If any Tax Claim or Unclaimed Property Claim shall be initiated, which,
if successful, might result in an indemnity payment under _Article_ __ _
IX_, the Indemnified Parties shall notify the Indemnifying Parties within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice of such a Tax Claim or Unclaimed
Property Claim; provided that, the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Parties have been actually prejudiced (to a non- _de minimis_
extent) by such failure or if the Indemnified Parties fail to notify
the Indemnifying Parties of such claim in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
6.05_ prior to the Survival Expiration Date.

 

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim or any portion thereof relating solely to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall have the right to control all
proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim
(including selection of counsel). Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed
of material developments relating to any such Tax Claim it controls and shall
not settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer if
such settlement would reasonably be expected to have a non- _de minimis_
adverse effect (taking into account Sellers indemnification obligations under
_Article_ __ _ IX_) on the Buyer or any of the Group Companies following the
Closing. Buyer shall control any Tax Claim that Seller is entitled to, but
does not elect in writing within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice
of such Tax Claim to, control pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_, and
Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed of material developments relating
to such Tax Claim. Buyer shall control, at its own expense but without
limitation of Sellers obligations pursuant to _Article_ __ _ IX_, all
proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim against the Group Companies that is
not described in the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_,
Buyer shall not settle or compromise any Tax Claim which would reasonably be
expected to result in an indemnity payment under _Article_ __ _ IX_ without
Sellers prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_,
the obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.05(a)_ shall not apply to any
Tax Claim involving the Taxes or Tax Returns of any of the Retained Companies,
which Seller shall control in its sole discretion.

 

(d) Seller shall control any Unclaimed Property Claim (including, if
applicable, the Unclaimed Property Audit) which includes any of the Retained
Companies, and Buyer shall control all other Unclaimed Property Claims. In the
event that Buyer controls the Unclaimed Property Audit, and intends to submit
a claim for indemnification under  _Article_ __ _ IX_ in connection
therewith, Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates (including the Group
Companies) to engage Reed Smith LLP and BDO USA LLP to represent the
applicable Group Companies. With respect to any Unclaimed Property Claims
that it controls, the controlling Party shall (i) bear all expenses (without
limiting Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to _Article_ __ _
IX_), (ii) keep the non-controlling Party reasonably informed of material
developments with respect to such Unclaimed Property Claims and (iii) not
settle any such Unclaimed Property Claim without the prior written consent of
the non-controlling Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed); provided, that in cases where Buyer controls any Unclaimed Property
Claim, Buyers obligations pursuant to this sentence shall only apply to such
Unclaimed Property Claims for which Seller is required to indemnify Buyer
pursuant to _Article_ __ _ IX_.

 



83

    

Section 6.06 _Post-Closing Payments_ _._ The parties agree that any (i)
payment of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.05(g)_ _,_ (ii)
payment made pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ VI_ or (iii) indemnification
payment made pursuant to _Article_ __ _ IX_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the portion of the Purchase Price attributable to the relevant
Purchased Shares and to treat such adjustments consistently therewith for U.S.
federal income and other applicable Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

ARTICLE VII

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 7.01 _Employee Communications and Consultations_. From and after
the date hereof until the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in
good faith regarding any written communications to be distributed to any
Business Employees relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or post-Closing terms of employment, and Buyer shall consult with Seller and
obtain Sellers consent before distributing any communications to any Business
Employees or any union or other labor representative.

 

Section 7.02 _Employee Transfers_. In connection with the Pre-Closing
Business Transfers, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall take such actions as are
necessary to transfer, prior to the Closing, the employment of each Business
Employee employed by a Retained Company other than an Inactive Employee to
the Group Company designated by Buyer prior to the Closing. As of the Closing,
each employee of a Group Company other than a Choice Employee will satisfy the
Service Condition. The transfers of employment to the Group Companies
described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ shall occur on a date on or prior to
the Closing Date as designated by Buyer with reasonable advance notice;
_provided_ , that, if the Closing Date is not the last day of a calendar
month, then such transfers shall become effective after the close of business
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 

Section 7.03 _Effect of Transfer_. Seller and Buyer intend that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not constitute a
separation, termination or severance of employment of any Business Employee
prior to or upon the occurrence of the Transfer Time, and that such employee
will have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately before and
immediately after the Transfer Time. Seller shall bear all the Liabilities,
obligations and costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
and its Affiliates from and against, any claims made by any Business Employee
for any statutory or common law severance, gratuity or other separation
benefits, any contractual or other severance or separation benefits and any
other legally mandated payment obligations (including any compensation payable
during a mandatory termination notice period and any payments pursuant to a
judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the Parties) and for any other
claim, cost, Liability or obligation (whether related to compensation,
benefits or otherwise), in each case, arising out of or in connection with
(i) the identification of Business Employees (other than Choice Employees);
(ii) the Pre-Closing Business Transfers; (iii) the employment of the Business
Employees prior to the Closing and (iv) the employment or termination of
employment of any employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries who is not a Business
Employee (including any Retained Employee). From and after the Transfer Time,
Buyer shall bear all the Liabilities, obligations and costs relating to, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against,
any claims relating to the employment of any Continuing Employee after the
Transfer Time solely to the extent such Liabilities relate to such

 



84

    

 Continuing Employees employment with the Group Companies following the
Transfer Time. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to
the extent any Business Employee is an Inactive Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date, such Inactive Employee shall be employed by a Retained
Company and shall not be transferred to Buyer on the Closing Date; provided,
that, if such Inactive Employee returns to work within the six (6)-month
period following the Closing Date (or such longer period as required by Law),
Buyer shall offer such employee continued employment with Buyer on the same
terms and conditions as if such employee were a Continuing Employee on
the Closing Date.

Section 7.04 _Continuation of Benefits_. With respect to each Continuing
Employee, following the Closing until December 31, 2020, or such shorter
period of employment (such period, the " _Benefits Continuation Period_ "),
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to (and shall cause any other
Person providing compensation and benefits on their behalf to): (a) provide
no less favorable base salary and wage rates, as applicable, than the base
salary and wage rates of such Continuing Employee in effect immediately prior
to the Closing; (b) provide severance and termination benefits to each such
Continuing Employee that are no less favorable than the severance and
termination benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates; and (c) provide other compensation and employee benefits that are
either (i) in the aggregate, no less favorable to Continuing Employees than
the other compensation and employee benefits provided to similarly situated
employees of Buyer and its Affiliates or (ii) substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the other compensation and employee benefits (excluding equity-
or equity-based compensation and non-qualified deferred compensation, and,
solely with respect to any Continuing Employee residing in or providing
services in Puerto Rico, tax qualified retirement benefits) provided to such
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be construed as (i)
limiting the obligations of Buyer or any of its Affiliates under applicable
Law, or as necessary to preclude claims from Business Employees for severance,
notice, termination pay or other economic compensation, to maintain the
terms, conditions and employee benefits of any Business Employees for any
period of time, or (ii) requiring either Buyer or any of its Affiliates to
continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any period after the
Closing Date.

Section 7.05 _Service Credit_. With respect to each Continuing
Employee, effective from and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) recognize for
all purposes (except benefit accruals) under all plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (other than
under a defined benefit pension plan, any benefit plan that provides retiree
welfare benefits, or any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides
grandfathered benefits) for the benefit of such Continuing Employees, service
with Seller and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing to the extent such
service was recognized under the corresponding Employee Plan or Group Company
Plan covering such Continuing Employee, except where it would result in a
duplication of benefits; (b) waive any pre-existing condition exclusion,
actively-at-work requirement or waiting period under all employee health and
other welfare benefit plans established or maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates (each a " _Buyer Plan_ ") for the benefit of the Continuing
Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing condition, exclusion,
requirement or waiting period would have applied to such individual under the
corresponding Employee Plan or Group Company Plan covering such Continuing
Employee and (c) provide credit for amounts paid by a Continuing Employees
under an Employee Plan or Group Company Plan covering such continuing Employee
for the plan year in which the Closing

 



85

    

 occurs for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of an analogous Buyer Plan, to the same extent such
credit was given under the applicable Employee Plan or Group Company Plan in
which the Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing.

Section 7.06 _Work Authorization_. If any Business Employee requires a
work permit, employment pass, visa or other legal or regulatory approval for
his or her employment with a Group Company following the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass, visa or other approval to
be obtained and in effect prior to the Transfer Time.

 

Section 7.07 _Vacation_. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume all
liabilities associated with accrued vacation and paid time off balances of
any Continuing Employees, solely to the effect the proposed vacation and paid
time off are reflected as a current liability in Net Working Capital, and
shall credit and honor, in accordance with the terms of the applicable policy
of Seller or its Subsidiaries, all vacation days and other paid time off
accrued but not yet taken by the Continuing Employees.

 

Section 7.08 _Health and Welfare Benefits_. Seller shall be, or shall
cause the Retained Companies to be, responsible for all (a) medical, vision,
dental and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Continuing
Employee or his or her dependents, (b) claims for short-term and long-term
disability income benefits incurred by any Continuing Employee and (c) claims
for group life, travel and accident and accidental death and dismemberment
insurance benefits incurred by any Continuing Employee, in each case, prior to
the Transfer Time. Buyer shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be,
responsible for all (i) medical, vision, dental and prescription drug claims
for expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee or his or her dependents,
(ii) claims for short-term and long-term disability income benefits incurred
by any Continuing Employee and (iii) claims for group life, travel and
accident and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by
any Continuing Employee, in each case, on or after the Transfer Time. Except
in the event of any claim for workers compensation benefits, for purposes of
this Agreement, the following claims and liabilities shall be deemed to be
incurred as follows: (x) medical, vision, dental or prescription drug benefits
(including hospital expenses), upon provision of the services, materials or
supplies comprising any such benefits and (y) short- and long-term disability,
life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident
insurance benefits, upon the death, illness, injury or accident giving rise
to such benefits.

 

Section 7.09 _Workers_ __ _Compensation_. The Retained Companies shall
be responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are
incurred prior to the Transfer Time by any Continuing Employee to the extent
such claims are covered under a workers compensation plan or policy
maintained or owned by one of the Retained Companies. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be responsible for all claims for workers compensation
benefits that are incurred on or after the Transfer Time by any Continuing
Employee to the extent such claims are covered under a workers compensation
plan or policy maintained or owned by Buyer or its Affiliates. A claim for
workers compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event
giving rise to the claim (the " _Workers Compensation Event_ ") occurs. If
the Workers Compensation Event occurs over a period both preceding and
following the Transfer Time, the claim shall be the joint responsibility and
liability of Seller and Buyer and shall be equitably apportioned
between Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, based upon the
relative periods of time that the Workers Compensation Event transpired
preceding and following the Transfer Time.

 



86

    

Section 7.10 _401(k) Plan_. As of the Closing Date, all Continuing
Employees will be fully vested in their account balances under the applicable
defined contribution plan and trusts intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code that they participate in prior to the Closing (the " _Seller
401(k) Plans_ "). Promptly following the Closing, Seller shall make to the
Seller 401(k) Plans all employee contributions and certain other discretionary
contributions as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.10_ with respect to the
Continuing Employees employment service rendered prior to the Closing Date
(the " _Equivalent Contributions_ "). As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
maintain a defined contribution retirement plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ") for the benefit of
those Continuing Employees who shall elect and are eligible to participate in
the Buyer 401(k) Plan. As soon as reasonably practicable on or following the
Closing Date, but in no event later than sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, for those Continuing Employees who elect and are eligible
to participate in the Buyer 401(k) Plan, allow such Continuing Employees to
make a "direct rollover" to the Buyer 401(k) Plan of any account balance under
a Seller 401(k) Plan, and Buyer shall cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept as
rollover contributions, all account balances (which shall include any
vested employer contributions accrued (or the Equivalent Contribution
therefor) through the Closing Date and all outstanding loans; _provided_ ,
that (i) the Continuing Employee initiates a direct rollover within sixty (60)
days following the Closing Date or such other reasonable time as required by
the third-party administrator of a Seller 401(k) Plan and (ii) any Continuing
Employee who has an outstanding loan under a Seller 401(k) Plan must elect to
roll over such Continuing Employees entire balance into the Buyer 401(k)
Plan in order to also roll over such loan into the Buyer 401(k) Plan), subject
to and in accordance with the provisions of such plans and applicable Law. The
Seller 401(k) Plans shall permit rollover distributions consistent with this
_Section_ __ _ 7.10_ for any Continuing Employees who have incurred a
termination of employment or otherwise have a distributable event. The Parties
agree to cooperate in good faith and to take all necessary and appropriate
actions to ensure that loans held by Continuing Employees under the Seller
401(k) Plans do not default, offset or otherwise require repayment (other than
pursuant to the payment schedule in effect for such loan) as a result of, or
in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 7.11 _Restrictive Covenants_ _._ Seller shall not (i) take any
action that would impede, hinder, interfere or otherwise compete (directly or
indirectly) with Buyers effort to hire or employ any Business Employee or
(ii) enforce against any Continuing Employee any non-compete or other
restrictive covenant that would restrict or prohibit in any manner such
employees ability to accept an offer from or become employed by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, or such employees employment or ability to provide
services to Buyer or any of its Affiliates in any capacity from and after the
Closing. Seller shall assign to Buyer all of Sellers right in, and interest
as a beneficiary under, the Contracts, Employee Plans or other arrangements
set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.11_.

 

Section 7.12 _Payroll Services_. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, Seller shall cooperate in good faith with Buyer in
connection with (i) Buyers establishment of a full payroll system for the
Group Companies and/or otherwise with respect to Continuing Employees, (ii)
onboarding of Continuing Employees to the Buyer Plans and (iii) such other
actions as Buyer deems necessary and appropriate in connection with the
foregoing. Such

 



87

    

 cooperation shall include the timely provision of such data and other
information as, and in the form, requested by Buyer. Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 7.12 to the contrary, Buyer may request, within fourteen (14)
days prior to the Closing Date, that Seller provide mutually agreed upon
payroll services for the Group Companies and Continuing Employees through the
Transition Services Agreement for a period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the date that is no earlier than the three (3)-month anniversary of
the Closing Date (unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with the
Transition Services Agreement).

 

Section 7.13 _Third-Party Rights_. The provisions contained in this
Agreement with respect to any Business Employee are included for the sole
benefit of the Parties and shall not create any right in any other Person,
including any Business Employee (or dependent or beneficiary of any of the
foregoing). Nothing in this  _Article_ __ _ VII_ shall be deemed an
amendment to or creation of any plan providing benefits to any Business
Employee or shall be deemed to prohibit or restrict Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee
following the Transfer Time. The provisions of this _Article_ __ _ VII_ are
for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any person (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Business Employee), other than the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or
other rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement.

guarantor under the Credit Facility and such release is not automatic

Documents_ ") in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and (ii)
fully executed copies of such Debt Release Documents shall have been
delivered to the applicable parties and to Buyer at or prior to the Closing;

(f) Buyer shall have received all documents and other items to be delivered
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(c)(ii)_  _(v)_.

Section 8.03 _Conditions to the Obligations of_ _Seller_ _._ The

satisfaction of the following conditions at the Closing, any one or more of
which may be waived in writing by Seller:

(a) Buyer shall have performed, in all material respects, all of its

this Agreement and at and as of the Closing as if made at and as of such time
(other than such representations and warranties that by their terms address
matters only as of an earlier specified date, which shall be true and correct
only as of such date), except where the failure of such representations
and warranties to be so true and correct would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with, prevent or
materially delay the ability of Buyer to enter into and perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby; and

(c) Buyer shall have delivered to Seller a certificate signed by an
executive officer of Buyer, dated as of the Closing Date, certifying that each
of the conditions specified in _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ and _Section_ __ _

Section 8.04 _Frustration of Conditions._ Neither Buyer nor Seller may
rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ or
_Section_ __ _ 8.03_ to be satisfied if such failure was caused by the
failure of Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other
hand, respectively, to (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate
transactions contemplated hereby as required by and subject to _Section_ __ _
5.04_ and (b) otherwise comply with their obligations under this Agreement in
any material respect.

acknowledge and agree that with respect to any claim that any Party may have
against any other Party that is permitted pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Survival Expiration Dates set forth and agreed to in this

Section 9.04 _Environmental Indemnity Matters_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Parties agree that, in addition to the other
provisions set forth in this _Article_ __ _ IX_, with respect to any
environmental liability or environmental matter (including any matter arising
under any Environmental Laws or involving any remedial action) subject to
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)(i)_, _Section_ __ _
9.02(a)(vi)_, or _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)(vii)_ (each an " _Environmental

(a) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee for

Environmental Law; (B) demanded by a Governmental Authority pursuant to any

encourage such demand; (C) such actions mitigate Damages or are necessary to
remediate an imminent and substantial threat to human health or the

Date, including in connection with any post-Closing change of use, any new
use, any construction, expansion, cessation of business activities, closure,
demolition, or the abandonment of any of the Real Property by a Buyer
Indemnitee, its Affiliates or Representatives; (iii) resulting from the coming
into force of, or the change in, any Environmental Law at or after the Closing
Date, _provided_ that this exception applies to costs or activities to the
extent that they are incurred due to such enactment or change in Environmental
Law; (iv) resulting from communications or interactions by Buyer, its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives, with Governmental Authorities
or other third parties that are not required under the circumstances and that
have the effect of identifying an Environmental Indemnity Matter subject to
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_; (v) caused by any failure by
any Buyer Indemnitee to take commercially reasonable measures to mitigate
Damages, including in connection with the application of commercially
reasonable environmental, health, or safety measures that are consistent with

 



94

    

 applicable industry standards; or (vi) to the extent such Damages otherwise
have been caused, exacerbated, compounded or aggravated after the Closing Date
by any Person (other than Seller or its Affiliates or any of their respective
personnel or contractors).

(b) Any obligation of Seller to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for the
remediation of a liability or matter constituting an Environmental Indemnity
Matter shall be limited to, and its obligations regarding such remediation
under this Agreement shall be satisfied upon achievement of, in a reasonably
cost-effective manner, the minimum standards required to be met, based on
industrial/commercial use, by applicable Environmental Laws as in effect at
the date hereof; provided that the foregoing is acceptable to relevant
Governmental Authorities, and provided further that, the above limitation
shall not apply in the case of any such Environmental Indemnity Matter to the
extent set forth in any final, non-appealable order regarding a Third Party
Claim. The Parties expressly agree that such minimum standards may, if
reasonable, include risk-based clean-up remedies and standards or the
imposition of institutional controls, such as deed restrictions and
engineering or institutional controls, if approved by relevant Governmental
Authorities (provided, that, in connection with the foregoing, a Buyer
Indemnitee shall not incur any Damages that are not fully indemnified by
Seller and that the foregoing shall not prevent or impair in any material
respect the use of any property, as such property is then used), and further
agree to, if reasonable, request that reasonable risk-based clean-up remedies
and standards or the imposition of reasonable institutional controls be
applied to any remediation required for an Environmental Indemnity Matter.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section_ __ _ 9.05_, and
without prejudice to any Persons rights under _Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_,
Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to retain the defense and
control of any Environmental Indemnity Matter (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to any Permits and Permit renewals related thereto),
including the management, disclosure, investigation, negotiation, performance
and settlement thereof, and all interactions with Governmental Authorities
with regard thereto, and shall (i) keep Buyer reasonably informed relating to
the progress of such Environmental Indemnity Matter and provide reasonable
opportunity for Buyer to comment to Seller on any proposed activities, plans,
reports and external correspondence relating to such Environmental Indemnity
Matter and (ii) select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized
standing and competence in connection with such Environmental Indemnity Matter
(subject to the approval of Buyer which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(d) In the event Seller does not retain the defense and control of any
Environmental Indemnity Matter, and Buyer provides a defense for the
Environmental Indemnity Matter in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.05_, Buyer
shall (i) keep Seller reasonably informed relating to the progress of
such Environmental Indemnity Matter and provide reasonable opportunity for
Seller to comment to Buyer on any proposed activities, plans, reports and
external correspondence relating to such Environmental Indemnity Matter and
(ii) select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and
competence in connection with such Environmental Indemnity Matter (subject to
the approval of Seller which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed); _provided_ ,  _however_ , if Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including one or more Group Companies) provides such defense for an
Environmental Indemnity Matter in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.05_, such
defense shall be at Sellers sole cost and expense, and Seller shall,
promptly upon request by Buyer and in addition to any indemnification
obligation that Seller

 



95

    

 may have, reimburse Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Group Companies)
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) and all reasonable and
documented fees and expenses of their respective outside representatives, in
each case, incurred in connection with such defense by the Buyer or such
Affiliates for such Environmental Indemnity Matter in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.05_.

 

(e) In the event Seller retains the defense and control of any
Environmental Indemnity Matter, Buyer shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Group Companies) and any other Buyer Indemnitees to reasonably
cooperate with and assist, and Buyer shall not and shall not cause its
Subsidiaries (including Group Companies) and any other Buyer Indemnities
to not, unreasonably interfere with, Seller with regard to such Environmental
Indemnity Matter, including providing reasonable access to the Real Property,
representatives, utilities, staging areas and other goods and services that
may be necessary to manage any such Environmental Indemnity Matter, and
providing reasonable assistance in the collection of information or documents,
in each case as reasonably required by Seller in connection with such
Environmental Indemnity Matter; _provided_ , that, in connection with the
foregoing, a Buyer Indemnitee shall not incur any Damages that are not fully
indemnified by Seller and that the foregoing shall not prevent or impair in
any material respect the use of any property, as such property is then used.
Any such access and assistance pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.04(e)_ shall
be conducted (i) in accordance with the applicable Laws, (ii) during normal
business hours, (iii) in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the normal conduct of the business of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Group Companies) and (iv) at Sellers sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer and its Affiliates may withhold any document or
information to the extent the disclosure of such document or information would
reasonably be expected to violate any Contract of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or any applicable Law or result in the waiver of any legal
privilege or work-product privilege; _provided_ that, in accordance with such
Contract or Law, and in a manner that does not result in the waiver of any
such privilege, Buyer and its Affiliates shall make reasonable and appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of this sentence apply. Buyer shall have the right to have a
Representative present at all times during any such access. Seller shall hold
in confidence all such information in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.14_.
Regardless of whether Seller retains the defense and control of any
Environmental Indemnity Matter, Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with and
assist the applicable Governmental Authorities regarding, and, after the
Closing Date, to take commercially reasonable steps to reasonably assist in
implementing, in good faith, Sellers reasonable remediation plans with
respect to the specific facilities and matters set forth on  _Section_ __ _
9.02(a)(vi)_, in each case, at Sellers sole cost and expense ( _provided_ ,
that, solely with respect to the facilities and circumstances described in
Item 4 of _Schedule 9.02(a)(vi)_ , such expenses shall be borne by Seller
only to the extent such expenses exceed the dollar threshold amount specified
for each facility on such Schedule); _provided_ , that, in connection with the
foregoing, a Buyer Indemnitee shall not incur any Damages that are not fully
indemnified by Seller and that the foregoing shall not prevent or impair in
any material respect the use of any property, as such property is then used.
If Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including one or more Group Companies)
provides such access, assistance or cooperation in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 9.04(e)_, Seller shall, promptly upon request by Buyer and in
addition to any indemnification obligation that Seller may have, reimburse
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) for all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Group Companies) and all reasonable and documented fees and
expenses of their respective outside representatives, in each case, incurred
in connection with the provision of such access, assistance or cooperation by
the Buyer or such Affiliates.

 



96

    

(f) In furtherance of the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 9.05(a)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 9.05(c)_, the Parties agree that a claim for indemnification
for any Environmental Indemnity Matter that (i) involves a Third Party Claim
shall be asserted by the delivery of a Claim Notice in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.05(a)_ or (ii) does not involve a Third Party Claim shall be
asserted by the delivery of a written notice in accordance with  _Section_ __
_ 9.05(c)_ (an " _Other_ _Claim Notice_ ") to the Party from whom
indemnification is sought in accordance with this clause (ii), which Other
Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the claim and
the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification of an
Environmental Indemnity Matter. Such Other Claim Notice shall be delivered
reasonably promptly after the date on which the Indemnified Party knows or has
a reasonable basis to believe it has a claim for indemnification for such
Environmental Indemnity Matter and, if reasonably feasible, within sufficient
time before information about such Environmental Indemnity Matter is disclosed
to a Governmental Authority to enable the Indemnifying Party to have
meaningful review of and provide input on any such disclosure or to, at the
Indemnifying Partys option, retain the defense and control of the
Environmental Indemnity Matter and to make any such reasonable disclosure to
a Governmental Authority, _provided_ that if the Indemnified Party is required
by applicable Law to disclose information about such Environmental Indemnity
Matter to a Governmental Authority immediately upon the Indemnified Partys
discovery of such information or otherwise as would not reasonably allow
compliance with the prior notice provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.04_
_(e)_ , an Other Claim Notice and all information provided to the
Governmental Authority in connection therewith shall be provided to the
Indemnifying Party at the same time as disclosure to the Governmental
Authority. Failure by an Indemnified Party to provide a claim notice in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.04(e)_ will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any Liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party,
except to the extent (x) the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially
prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice or (y) the
Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party
Claim prior to the Survival Expiration Date, if applicable.

 

Section 9.05 _Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement
shall only be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming indemnification
under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any claim
(other than a Tax Claim) asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third
party (" _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ shall (i) promptly (but no later
than twenty (20) days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim) notify
the other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third Party Claim and
(ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_
") stating the nature, basis, the amount thereof (to the extent known or
estimated, which amount shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such
Third Party Claim), the method of computation thereof (to the extent known or
estimated), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints
relating thereto, and, to the extent practicable, any other material details
pertaining thereto, along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing
such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure to
notify the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.05(a)_
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability that it may have to
the Indemnified Party, except to the extent (1) the Indemnifying Party

 



97

    

 is actually and materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to
give such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnifying
Party of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
9.05(a)_ prior to the applicable Survival Expiration Date. The Parties will
act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise
dealing with Third Party Claims. 

(b) An Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party
as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of the Claim Notice,
elect to assume and thereafter conduct, at its sole cost and expense, the
defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel of the Indemnifying Partys
choice if (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees to thereafter consult with and
provide reasonable updates to the Indemnified Party on a reasonably prompt
basis and (ii) the Third Party Claim involves only monetary damages and is not
criminal or quasi-criminal action and does not seek any material injunction
or other material equitable relief against any Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to participate in the defense thereof and
to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
the Indemnifying Party (other than any fees and expenses of such separate
counsel that are incurred between the date the Indemnified Party provides the
Indemnifying Party with the Claim Notice and the date the Indemnifying Party
effectively assumes control of such defense, which fees and expenses, shall,
notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article_ __ _ IX_, be borne by the Indemnifying Party to the extent the
underlying matter is determined to be subject to indemnification pursuant to
this _Article_ __ _ IX_); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party
may hire separate counsel, and the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party if (x) upon reasonable advice
of counsel to the Indemnified Party that a conflict or potential conflict
exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would
make such separate representation advisable or (y) one or more defenses are
available to the Indemnified Party that are not available to the Indemnifying
Party. An Indemnifying Party may settle or compromise any such Third Party
Claim, and each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all respects with the
conduct of such defense by the Indemnifying Party (including the making of any
related claims, counterclaims or cross complaints against any Person in
connection with the Third Party Claim) or the settlement of such Third Party
Claim by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party will not approve of the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement or compromise with respect to such Third Party Claim without
the Indemnified Partys prior written approval, unless the terms of such
settlement (A) provide for a complete and unconditional release of the claims
that are the subject of such Third Party Claim in favor of the Indemnified
Party with prejudice, (B) does not require or include any admission or finding
of wrongdoing on behalf of any Indemnified Party and (C) does not impose any
injunctive or other equitable remedies or other obligation on any Indemnified
Party other than the payment of money damages for which each Indemnified Party
will be indemnified to the extent provided for hereunder (subject to the
limitations set forth in this  _Article_ __ _ IX_). If the Indemnifying
Party does not, within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of the Claim
Notice, assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified
Party may conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) the Indemnified Party will not agree to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (B) if at any time
the Indemnifying Party acknowledges and agrees in writing to indemnify Damages
arising from such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may thereafter
assume the defense of such

 



98

    

 Third Party Claim in accordance herewith; _provided_ , that in the event the
Indemnified Party conducts the defense of such Third Party claim pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_, the Indemnifying Party (x) shall reimburse
the Indemnified Party for the costs of defending against such claim (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) and (y) shall remain otherwise
responsible for any Liability with respect to amounts arising from or related
to such claim, in each case, to the extent it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnifying Party is liable with respect to such claim for a breach
under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, _Article_ __ _ VI_ and not
this _Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_ shall govern the conduct of any Tax Claim or
Unclaimed Property Claim.

 

(c) If any Indemnified Party becomes aware of any circumstances that may
give rise to a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.02_
for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim, then such Indemnified Party
shall promptly (i) notify the Indemnifying Party and (ii) deliver to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice describing in reasonable detail the
nature of the claim, describing in reasonable detail the basis of the
Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement and
including the Indemnified Partys best estimate of the amount of Damages that
may arise from such claim. Failure to notify the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.05(c)_ will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to the
Indemnified Party, except to the extent (A) the Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give
such notice or (B) the Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnifying
Party of such claim in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.05(c)_ prior to
the applicable Survival Expiration Date.

 

(d) At the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified
Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives all
reasonable access to the books, records, employees and properties of such
Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the matters to which the
applicable indemnification claim relates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , such
Indemnified Party shall not be required to grant access to any information to
the extent such access or disclosure would result in the waiver of any legal
privilege or work-product privilege. All such access shall be granted during
normal business hours and shall be granted under the conditions which shall
not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such
Indemnified Party.

 

Section 9.06 _Calculation of_ _Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein: 

(a) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification to the extent
a Liability or reserve relating to the matter giving rise to such
indemnification has been included in the final determination of Closing Date
Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash or Closing
Date Transaction Expenses;

 

(b) no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for Damages
with respect to (i) Taxes that arise from a breach of any covenant or
agreement made or to be performed by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including,
from and after the Closing, the Group Companies) pursuant to this Agreement,
(ii) Taxes that arise from any action taken by Buyer or its Subsidiaries
(including, from and after the Closing, the Group Companies) on the Closing
Date following the Closing outside the ordinary course of business that are
not otherwise specifically contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the amount
of any net operating loss, Tax basis, Tax credit or other Tax attribute (or
the loss, unavailability or reduction thereof), except to the extent resulting
directly in additional cash Tax Liability of the Group Companies for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period that otherwise

 



99

    

 would not have been imposed (for the avoidance of doubt, without limiting
the obligation for the Excluded Tax Matter) or (iv) any Transfer Taxes that
are allocated to Buyer pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.01(c)_;

(c) each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to recover under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or similar
agreements other than this Agreement for any Damages to the same extent such
party would if such Damages were not subject to indemnification pursuant to
this  _Article_ __ _ IX_;

(d) the amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Party
claims indemnification under this Agreement shall be reduced by (i) any
insurance proceeds (other than any proceeds received under the RandW Insurance
Policy, which shall be additive to, and not in lieu of, the recovery
hereunder) actually received by an Indemnified Party with respect to such
Damages (net of any documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Party (including the present value of any increase in
insurance premiums or similar expenses)), (ii) any Tax benefits actually
realized as a result of such Damages for the taxable year in which such
Damages are taken into account in determining taxable income or loss, and for
the two (2) subsequent taxable years, calculated on a "with and without"
basis, and (iii) all other amounts actually recovered from an unaffiliated
third party pursuant to indemnification or otherwise in respect of
such Damages, in each case, (net of any documented out-of-pocket costs or
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party); _provided_ , that, in each case,
if an Indemnified Party actually recovers and receives an amount from a third
party in respect of Damages that are the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of such Damages have been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ IX_, then the Indemnified Party shall
promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) remit to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such proceeds actually received from such
third party (net of any documented costs or expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party (including the present value of any increase in insurance
premiums or similar expenses)) or, if less, the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Damages pursuant to this _Article_ __ _
IX_;

(e) in the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Damages in respect of
a claim of indemnification under this _Article_ __ _ IX_, no other
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the same Damages in respect of
a claim for indemnification;

 

(f) no Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article_ __ _ IX_, to sue for, or to assert any other right or remedy with
respect to, any Damages, causes of action or other claims to the extent they
are primarily possible or potential Damages, causes of action or claims that
such party believes may be asserted rather than Damages, causes of action or
claims that have, in fact, been filed against such Indemnified Party or paid
or incurred by such Indemnified Party; and

 

(g) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (unless (x) actually
awarded on account of a Third Party Claim or (y) the applicable Damages (1)
do not arise from any special circumstances of the Person suffering such
Damages or do arise from any special circumstances of the Person suffering
such Damages if such circumstances were known to the Indemnifying Party and
(2) are the natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable result of the event
that gave rise thereto or the matter for which indemnification is sought
hereunder), no Party shall 

 



100

    

 be liable for any (i) special, punitive, exemplary, consequential or
indirect damages, (ii) lost profits or lost business, loss of enterprise
value, diminution in value, damage to reputation or loss of goodwill or (iii)
damages calculated based on a multiple of profits, revenue or any other
financial metric, in each case, whether based on contract, tort, strict
liability, other Law or otherwise, and whether or not arising from any other
Partys sole, joint or concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault.

 

Section 9.07 _Assignment of Claims_ _._ If the Indemnified Party receives
any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_ and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a
part of such Damages from a third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based
on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall, to the extent permitted by Law, assign such of its
rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit
the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount
of such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Seller be
entitled to indemnification, contribution or other form of payment from, or
subrogation against, any of the Group Companies or their respective
Affiliates in respect of amounts expended by Seller to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnitee under this Agreement.

 

Section 9.08 _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_ _._ Except with
respect to (a) claims based on Fraud solely in respect of any representation
or warranty expressly given in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
by Seller pursuant to this Agreement, (b) claims for injunctive or equitable
remedies, (c) claims filed under the RandW Insurance Policy, (d) claims
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ or (e) claims expressly permitted by the
other Transaction Documents, following the Closing, indemnification
pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ IX_ will be the sole and exclusive monetary
remedy of the Parties and any Person claiming by or through any party
(including the Indemnified Parties) related to or arising from any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in, or
otherwise pursuant to, this Agreement, and neither Buyer nor Seller will have
any other rights or remedies in connection with any breach of this Agreement
or any other liability arising out of the negotiation, entry into or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether based
on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise. All
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual in
nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth in this
_Article_ __ _ IX_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.08_ shall limit a
partys right to bring a claim for Fraud to the extent such claim cannot be
waived as a matter of Delaware public policy with respect to contracts as
contemplated by _Abry Partners V, L.P. v. F andW Acquisition LLC, 891 A.2d 1032
(Del. Ch. 2006)_. Furthermore, Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that,
except in the case of Fraud solely in respect of any representation or
warranty expressly given in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by
Seller pursuant to this Agreement:

 

(a) the Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities
and obligations respecting the transactions contemplated hereby exclusively
in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement and
hereby waive any statutory and common law remedies, with respect to matters
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

(b) the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties
set forth herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter
into this Agreement) or any Action otherwise

 



101

    

 arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract
only (as such contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded
pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement);

(c) the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in this _Article_
__ _ IX_ were specifically bargained for between the Parties and were taken
into account by the Parties in arriving at the Purchase Price;

 

(d) after the Closing, no Party or its Affiliates may seek the rescission
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(e) the Parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the
justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arms-length
negotiations, and the Parties specifically acknowledge that no Party has any
special relationship with another Party that would justify any
expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an
arms-length transaction; and

 

(f) in furtherance and not in limitation of any of the foregoing in this
_Article_ __ _ IX_, each Party (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates)
acknowledges and agrees that no Financing Source shall have Liability for any
claims or Damages to the Seller Indemnitees in connection with this Agreement,
the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ shall not be considered "remedies" for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.08_ and shall not be limited by the terms
of this _Section_ __ _ 9.08_.

 

ARTICLE X

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 10.01 _Termination_ _._ This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

 

(b) by written notice from either Party to the other Party, if any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction has issued or entered a
final, non-appealable Law (other than a temporary restraining order) or taken
any other Action, in each case, permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ that, this right of termination shall not be available to any Party
whose failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement has been the
primary cause of, or has primarily resulted in, such Law or other Action;

(c) by written notice from Buyer to Seller, if there is a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in _Article_ __ _ III_ hereof (or any
representation or warranty set forth in _Article_ __ _ III_ has become
inaccurate) or if there is a breach of any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or performed by Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
(or failure by Seller to comply with or perform any covenant or agreement
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), in each case, that would cause the
failure of a condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ to be satisfied at

 



102

    

 the Closing; _provided_ that, in each case under this clause (c), Buyer may
not terminate this Agreement unless (i) Buyer has given written notice of such
breach, inaccuracy or failure to comply to Seller and Seller has not cured
such breach or remedied such inaccuracy by the earlier of thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice and the Outside Date or (ii) such breach is not
capable of being cured; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Buyer is not then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement;

 

(d) by written notice from Seller to Buyer, if there is a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in  _Article_ __ _ IV_ hereof (or any
representation or warranty set forth in _Article_ __ _ IV_ has become
inaccurate) or if there is a breach of any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or performed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
(or failure by Buyer to comply with or perform any covenant or agreement
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), in each case, that would cause the
failure of a condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ to be satisfied at
the Closing; _provided_ that, in each case under this clause (d), Seller may
not terminate this Agreement unless (i) Seller has given written notice of
such breach, inaccuracy or failure to comply to Buyer and Buyer has not cured
such breach or remedied such inaccuracy by the earlier of thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice and the Outside Date or (ii) such breach is not
capable of being cured;  _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller is not then in
material breach of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 

(e) by written notice from either Party to the other Party on or after
November 6, 2020 (the " _Initial Outside Date_ " and, as the same may be
extended in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ _(e)_ , the " _Outside
Date_ ") if the Closing has not occurred on or before such date; _provided_
that if on the Initial Outside Date all of the conditions set forth in
_Sections_ _8.01_ , _8.02_ and _8.03_ have been satisfied or waived at such
time, other than the conditions (i) with respect to actions the Parties are
required to take at the Closing itself as provided herein and (ii) set forth
in _Sections_ _8.01(a)_ or _(b)_ (but solely in the case of _Section_ __ _
8.01(b)_ with respect to Closing Legal Impediments arising with respect to
any Antitrust Law), then the Initial Outside Date shall automatically be
extended to February 6, 2021; _provided_ _,_ _further_ , that this right of
termination shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or has
primarily resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Outside Date.

 

Section 10.02 _Effect of Termination_ _._ Except as otherwise set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, in the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any Liability on the part of
any Party or its Affiliates, Representatives or stockholders (or any
Financing Source or its Affiliates, Representatives or stockholders), other
than Liability of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, for any Intentional and
Willful Breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination. In
addition, without modifying or qualifying in any way the preceding sentence or
implying any intent contrary thereto, Seller (on behalf of itself and any of
its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives)
hereby waives any rights or claims against the Financing Sources and hereby
agrees that in no event shall the Financing Sources have any Liability or
obligation to Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives and in no event
shall Seller seek or obtain any other Damages of any kind against any
Financing Source (including consequential, special, indirect or punitive
damages), in each case, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Financing or the transactions contemplated

 



103

    

 hereby or thereby. In determining losses or damages recoverable upon
termination by a Party for another Partys breach, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that such losses and damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and shall include the benefit of the bargain
lost by such Party, which shall constitute damages payable to such Party. The
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.15_, _Section_ __ _ 5.22(c)_, _Section_ __ _
5.22(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.22(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.28_ and this _Section_

governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of

prior written consent of such Financing Sources.

Section 11.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is
held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The
Parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining
provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise
modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held
invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect
to the intent of the Parties.

 

Section 11.12 _Disclosure Schedule_ _s_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that (a) the inclusion of any item, information or other matter in the
Disclosure Schedules that is not required by this Agreement to be so included
is solely for the convenience of Buyer, (b) the disclosure by Seller of any
item, information or other matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be
deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by Seller that such item, information
or other matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or
that such item, information or other matter is material, (c) if any section
of the Disclosure Schedules lists an item or information in such a way as to
make its relevance to the disclosure required by or provided in another
section of the Disclosure Schedules, any Section of  _Article_ __ _ III_ or
the statements contained in any Section of _Article_ __ _ III_ reasonably
apparent on its face, such item or information shall be deemed to have been
disclosed in or with respect to such other section of the Disclosure
Schedules and _Article_ __ _ III_, notwithstanding the omission of an
appropriate cross-reference to such other section of the Disclosure Schedules
or in _Article_ __ _ III_ or the omission of a reference in the particular
representation and warranty to such section of the Disclosure Schedules, (d)
except as provided in clause (c) above, headings have been inserted in the
Disclosure Schedules for convenience of reference only, (e) the Disclosure
Schedules are qualified in their entirety by reference to specific provisions
of this Agreement and (f) the Disclosure Schedules and the information and
statements contained therein are not intended to broaden or constitute, and
shall not be construed as broadening or constituting, representations,
warranties or covenants of Seller except as and to the extent provided in this
Agreement.

 

Section 11.13 _Enforcement_ _._ The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur, and that the Parties would not have an adequate remedy at Law,
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages
or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled
at Law or in equity. Each Party agrees to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. The Parties
further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy.

Section 11.14 _Non-Recourse_ _._ This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be
brought against, the entities that are expressly named as Parties (together
with any assignee of Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.04_ and Guarantor)
and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to such named Party. No Non-Recourse Party shall have any Liability
(whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
Liabilities of Seller or Buyer under this Agreement (whether
for indemnification or otherwise) or of or for any claim based on, arising
out of or related to this Agreement.

 

Section 11.15 _Privileged Matters; Conflicts of Interest_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that their respective rights and obligations to
maintain, preserve, assert or waive any attorney-client and work product
privileges belonging to the other Parties with respect to the Business and the
Retained Businesses (collectively, " _Privileges_ ") shall be governed by the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.15(a)_. With respect to matters
relating to the Retained Businesses, the Retained Assets or the Retained
Liabilities, and with respect to all documents, communications or other
information (collectively, " _Information_ ") of any of the Retained
Companies prepared in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, Seller shall have sole authority to determine whether to
assert or waive any Privileges, including the right to assert any Privilege
against Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Buyer shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Group Companies) not to, take
any action without the prior written consent of Seller that would reasonably
be expected to result in any waiver of any such Privileges of Seller. After
the Closing, Buyer shall have sole authority to determine whether to assert or
waive any Privileges with respect to matters relating to the Business
(except for the Retained Liabilities and Information prepared in connection
with this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby). However, Buyer may not assert any such
Privileges of Buyer related to pre-Closing advice or communications relating
to the Business against the Retained Companies. Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, take any action after the Closing without the
prior written consent of Buyer that would reasonably be expected to result in
any waiver of any such Privileges of Buyer. The rights and obligations created
by this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ shall apply to all Information as to which the
Retained Companies or the Group Companies would be entitled to assert or has
asserted a Privilege without regard to the effect, if any, of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Privileged Information_ "). Upon receipt by the
Retained Companies, or Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing, the Group Companies), as the case may be, of any subpoena, discovery
or other request from any third party that actually or arguably calls for the
production or disclosure of Privileged Information of the other or if the
Retained Companies or Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing,
the Group Companies), as the case may be, obtains knowledge that any current
or former employee of the Retained Companies or the Group Companies has
received any subpoena, discovery or other request from any third party that
actually or arguably calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged
Information of the other Party, such Party shall promptly notify the other of
the existence of the request and shall provide the other a reasonable
opportunity to review the Information and to assert any rights it may have
under this

 



109

    

  _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ or otherwise to prevent the production or disclosure
of Privileged Information. Seller transfer of any Business Records or other
Information to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement and Sellers agreement
to permit Buyer to obtain Information existing prior to the Closing are made
in reliance on the Parties respective agreements, as set forth in _Section_
__ _ 5.14_ and this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_, to maintain the confidentiality
of such Information and to take the steps provided herein for the preservation
of all Privileges that may belong to or be asserted by Seller or Buyer, as the
case may be. The access to Business Records and other Information being
granted pursuant to _Sections_ _5.02_ , _5.12_ , _5.13_ , _9.05_ and _Article_
__ _ VI_, the agreement to provide witnesses and individuals pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.12_ and the disclosure to Buyer and Seller of Privileged
Information relating to the Business or the Retained Businesses pursuant to
this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall
not be asserted by Seller or Buyer to constitute, or otherwise be deemed, a
waiver of any Privilege that has been or may be asserted under this _Section_
__ _ 11.15_ or otherwise.

 

(b) _Conflicts of Interest_. Buyer hereby waives and agrees not to assert,
and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to waive and not
assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing, of any of the Retained Companies or other
Affiliates or any of their respective officers, employees or directors (any
such person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement
or any of the other Transaction Documents or transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, by Latham and Watkins LLP (" _Prior _ _Business_ _Counsel_ ")
currently representing any Designated Person in connection with this Agreement
or any of the other Transaction Documents or transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Seller agree that,
following the Closing, Prior Business Counsel may serve as counsel to any
Designated Person in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including any litigation, claim
or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding any representation
by Prior Business Counsel prior to the Closing, and Buyer (on behalf of itself
and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Group Companies))
hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the
Group Companies), on the one hand, and any Designated Person, on the other
hand, Prior Business Counsel may represent one or more Designated Persons in
such dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly
adverse to Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Group
Companies) and even though Prior Business Counsel may have represented such
Group Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute.

 

Section 11.16 _Guarantee_. Guarantor hereby fully guarantees the due,
prompt and full performance, payment and discharge when due of all of the
covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings of Buyer under this
Agreement (including any payment obligations hereunder) in accordance with its
express terms (such obligations, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). Whenever
this Agreement requires Buyer to take any action or refrain from taking any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of Guarantor to cause Buyer to take such action or refrain from taking such
action. The Guaranteed Obligations are primary, absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable, and such obligations shall continue in full force and effect
until the payment and performance, as applicable, of all of the Guaranteed
Obligations and are not conditioned upon any event or contingency or upon any
attempt first to obtain payment from Buyer under this Agreement, or pursuit of
any other right or remedy against Buyer through the 

 



110

    

 commencement of an Action or otherwise. With respect to its obligations
hereunder, Guarantor expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of
payment, protest and all notices whatsoever (in each case, other than notices
expressly required to be provided to Buyer under this Agreement), all defenses
which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or
other similar applicable Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require
the marshalling of assets of Buyer, and all suretyship defenses generally;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Guarantor does not waive (i) any defense which
may be available in the case of Fraud by Seller, (ii) any defense to the
payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations that are available to
Buyer or its Affiliates or (iii) defenses that are available to Buyer or its
Affiliates due to the breach by Seller of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.16_.
Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that its obligations hereunder shall
continue in full force and effect, without notice from any other party in the
event the obligations of Buyer or Guarantor under this Agreement are amended
or in any way modified (so long as each such amendment or modification has
been made in accordance with the terms hereof), and that the Guaranteed
Obligations shall continue and shall apply in full to such amended
obligations of Buyer or Guarantor as though the amended terms had been part
of this Agreement from the original date of execution thereof. Guarantor
acknowledges and agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be released
or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (a) the failure
or delay on the part of Seller to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
right or remedy against Buyer; (b) any change in the time, place or manner of
payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any
rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, in each
case, in accordance with the terms hereof; (c) any change in the corporate
existence, structure or ownership of Buyer; (d) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Buyer; (e) the existence
of any claim, set-off or other right which Guarantor may have at any time
against Buyer, whether in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or
otherwise; or (f) the adequacy of any means Seller may have of obtaining
payment or performance related to the Guaranteed Obligations. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement Seller hereby agrees that
to the extent Buyer is relieved from its payment and performance obligations
under this Agreement by satisfaction thereof, the Guarantor shall be
similarly relieved, to such extent, of its obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 11.16_. Guarantor is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and has the requisite
corporate or equivalent organizational power and authority to own or lease its
assets and to conduct its business in all material respects as it is now being
conducted. The execution, delivery and performance by Guarantor of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby are
within the corporate or similar powers of Guarantor and have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Guarantor. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Guarantor and (assuming
the due and valid execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller)
constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of Guarantor, enforceable
against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally and to general principles of equity.
