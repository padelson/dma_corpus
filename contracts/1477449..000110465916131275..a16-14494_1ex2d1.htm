immediately prior to the Closing Date) over the exercise price per share of
such In-the-Money Option, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock then subject to such In-the-Money Option, to be paid in accordance with
_Sections 2.5_. Each Company Option that is not an In-the-Money Option will be
cancelled and forfeited for no consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
portion of the consideration payable to each Company Optionholder pursuant to
_Section 2.3_ shall be reduced pursuant to provisions of this _Section 2.6_
hereof. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall take all action
necessary to cause Options to be treated as set forth in this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

2.4 _Appraisal Rights_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time held by a holder who has properly demanded and not effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal rights for such shares under the
DGCL or other similar rights (if any) under applicable law (collectively, the
" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive a portion of the consideration as set forth in _Section 2.1_ , but the
holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by the
DGCL or other applicable law (if any).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.4(a)_ hereof, if any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights with respect to such
shares under the DGCL (and/or any other similar rights under other applicable
law (if any such other rights have been purportedly invoked)), then, as of the
later of the First Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
receive the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_ upon surrender of the
certificate(s) formerly representing such shares.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice
of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the DGCL (and of any similar demand purportedly made
under other applicable law) and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle
or settle any such demands other than as required by law or pursuant to a
final court order. Prior to the Closing Date, any written communication to be
made by the Company

 



      
 

 



 

to any Stockholder with respect to such demands shall be submitted to Parent
in advance, and the Company shall consider in good faith any input from Parent
with regards to such written communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent that Parent, the First Surviving Corporation or the Second
Surviving Corporation makes any payment or payments to holders of Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Section 262(i) of the DGCL in excess of the consideration
that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance
with this Agreement (the " _Excess Dissenting Share Payments_ "), Parent shall
be entitled to recover the amount of such Excess Dissenting Share Payments in
accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ hereof.

Payment of_ _Company Capital Stock_.

-$150,000; _minus_ (iv) the amount (if any) by which -$150,000 exceeds the

Estimated Cash Amount shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section
2.7_ hereof. The Company shall consider in good faith, and update the Closing
Certificate to reflect, any comments by Parent on such Closing Certificate.

 



 

(b) _Delivery of Closing Consideration Schedule_. At or prior to the Closing,
the Company shall deliver to Parent a schedule (the " _Closing Consideration

officer of the Company and which shall accurately set forth:

 



 

(i) a calculation of each of (x) the Common Consideration and Common Per Share

the Series B Consideration and Series B Per Share Amount;

 



 

(ii) all Common Stockholders and their respective addresses, the number of

certification that such Stockholder is an "accredited investor" within the
meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 501 of Regulation D, as
presently in effect, under the Securities Act, substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (an " _Accredited Investor Certification_ "),
and (ii) a letter of transmittal, substantially in the form of _Exhibit F_
(the " _Stockholder Transmittal Letter_ "), duly executed by such Stockholder,
together with accompanying share certificates representing such Stockholders
Company Capital Stock (the " _Stock Certificates_ "). No payment shall be made
with respect to any Stock Certificates until the surrender of such Stock
Certificates for exchange together with a properly completed and duly executed
Stockholder Transmittal Letter and, if applicable, the Accredited Investor
Certification.

 



 

(d) _Payments_.

 



 

(i) Parent shall deliver to each Common Stockholder who is an Accredited
Investor, each Series A Preferred Stockholder and each Series B Preferred
Stockholder promptly after the Closing, but in no event later than three
Business Days after both the Closing and Parents receipt of the applicable
documents required for payment under this _Section 2.5(d)(i)_ , (A) the cash

representing the aggregate Parent Stock payable to such Stockholder pursuant
to _Section 2.1_ as set forth on the Closing Consideration Schedule (less the
shares to be deposited into the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 2.6_ );
_provided_ , _that_ , the delivery of such cash and share certificates to any
Stockholder shall be conditioned on Parents receipt of an Accredited Investor
Certification and Stockholder Transmittal Letter properly completed and duly
executed by such Stockholder, and, to the extent that such documents are not
delivered to Parent at or prior to the Closing with respect to any
Stockholder, Parent shall not be obligated to deliver any cash or share
certificates to such Stockholder until the applicable documents are delivered
to Parent by such Stockholder.

 



 

(ii) Parent shall deliver to each Common Stockholder who is not an Accredited
Investor, promptly after the Closing, but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after both the Closing and Parents receipt of the applicable
documents required for payment under this _Section 2.5(d)(ii)_ , the cash
consideration to be paid to such Stockholder pursuant to _Section 2.1_ as set
forth on the Closing Consideration Schedule (less the amount to be deposited
into the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 2.6_ ); _provided_ , _that_ , the
delivery of such cash to any Stockholder shall be conditioned on Parents
receipt of a Stockholder Transmittal Letter properly completed and duly
executed by such Stockholder, and, to the extent that such documents are not
delivered to Parent at or prior to the Closing with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

any Stockholder, Parent shall not be obligated to deliver any cash to such
Stockholder until the applicable document is delivered to Parent by such
Stockholder.

 



 

(iii) No later than Parents first ordinary payroll payment date that is at
least three Business Days after the Closing, Parent shall cause to be paid to
each former holder of Company Options the cash consideration, which shall be
paid through the payroll system of Parent or its Subsidiary subject to
applicable Tax withholding, to be paid to such former holder of Company
Options pursuant to _Section 2.3_ as set forth on the Closing Consideration
Schedule (less the amount to be deposited into the Escrow Account pursuant to
_Section 2.6_ ).

 



 

(iv) If the consideration payable to any Stockholder is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the relevant Stock Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment of
such amounts that the Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise be in proper
form for transfer, that such transfer otherwise be proper, that the Person
requesting such transfer pay to the Second Surviving Corporation any transfer
or other Taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the
satisfaction of the Second Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been
paid or are not required to be paid and that the transferee duly execute and
deliver to Parent a Stockholder Transmittal Letter and Accredited Investor
Certification, if applicable.

 



 

(v) Parent shall satisfy any loan amounts due and owing to the Company
pursuant to the Loan Documents immediately prior to the Closing out of cash
consideration contemplated to be paid to each Equityholder who is a borrower
under the Loan Documents in the amounts owed by each such Equityholder by
first reducing the cash consideration payable to such Equityholder pursuant to
_Section 2.5(d)(i)_ and, second, if necessary, reducing the cash consideration
payable to such Equityholder pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (net applicable
withholding Taxes).

 



 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. At and after the
First Effective Time, each holder of issued and outstanding Company Capital
Stock immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as a holder of securities of the Company, except for (i) the right of a
holder of Company Capital Stock to surrender its, his or her Stock
Certificate(s) (together with the Accredited Investor Certification, if
applicable, and the Stockholder Transmittal Letter) in exchange for the
consideration payable in respect of such Company Capital Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ and such holders share of any distributions from the Escrow
Account pursuant to _Section 2.6_ hereof or (iii) in the case of a Dissenting
Stockholder, to perfect its, his or her right to receive payment (if any) for
Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL, if applicable. After the First
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the First Surviving Corporation of the Company Capital
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time. If, after the
First Effective Time, Stock Certificates are presented to the First Surviving
Corporation or Second Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_ , except as otherwise
provided by law.

 



 

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates representing fractional shares of
Parent Stock shall be issued in connection with the First Merger, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Parent Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a shareholder of Parent.

 



 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Damaged Stock Certificates_. In the event that any Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the delivery
by such Person of an indemnification agreement in such form and containing
such

 



      
 

 



 

substance acceptable to Parent, Parent will pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate the consideration to be paid with
respect thereto, subject to the terms and conditions in this _Article II_.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or
cause to be deducted and withheld) from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement (including consideration payable from the Escrow
Account) to any Stockholder, Company Optionholder or other Person such amounts
as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax law, and shall pay over such amounts to the appropriate taxing authority.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. For the avoidance
of doubt, to the extent any amounts are required to be so withheld from any
distributions from the Escrow Account, upon Parents request, such amounts
required to be withheld shall be distributed to Parent (or an entity
designated by Parent) to enable Parent (or any such designated entity) to
comply with its withholding obligations (including without limitation, any
obligations of the Company, the First Surviving Corporation or the Second
Surviving Corporation).

 



 

2.6 _Escrow_. In order to at least partially satisfy, and to establish a
procedure for the satisfaction of, amounts owed to Parent pursuant to _Section
2.7_ and claims by the Parent Indemnitees for indemnification pursuant to
_Article VIII_ hereof, Parent, the Stockholder Representative and Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") shall enter into the
Escrow Agreement on the Closing Date, pursuant to which Parent shall deposit
with the Escrow Agent (i) cash in the amount of Four Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($4,500,000) (the " _Cash Escrow Amount_ ") and (ii) an
aggregate of 695,580 shares of Parent Stock (the " _Stock Escrow Amount_ ")
within ten (10) business days after the Closing. Parent shall be deemed to
have contributed the proportion of the Escrow Amount with respect to each
Equityholder set forth on the Closing Consideration Schedule and the
consideration payable to each Equityholder pursuant to this _Article II_ shall
be reduced by such amount. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Escrow
Amount_ " means, as of any moment in time, the amount of cash and the value of
the Parent Stock then in the Escrow Account. Pursuant to the terms and subject
to the conditions of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall establish an
escrow account into which the Escrow Agent shall deposit the Escrow Amount
(the " _Escrow Account_ "). The timing and methodology for the release of the
Escrow Amount shall be governed by the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that each of Parent and the Stockholder Representative agrees that it will act
in good faith and cooperate with one another to execute and deliver such joint
written instructions, including with respect to any distributions of the
Escrow Amount, to the Escrow Agent as are required to implement the intent of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. After the eighteen month anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Stockholders and
Parent or the Second Surviving Corporation, on behalf of the Company
Optionholders, the remaining Escrow Amount minus the Pending Claims Amount in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement. In the event of a distribution of any
amounts from the Escrow Account to the Equityholders, each Equityholder shall
be entitled to receive a portion of such distribution equal to the proportion
set forth with respect to such Equityholder on the Closing Consideration
Certificate. For purposes of satisfying any claims for indemnification under
this Agreement, all shares of Parent Stock in the Escrow Account shall be
deemed to have a value equal to the Parent Stock Value, as adjusted for any
stock splits, dividends, combinations or the like, irrespective of the actual
value of such shares at the time the claim is satisfied out of the Escrow
Account. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no fraction of a
share of Parent Stock shall be released from the Escrow Account and all
releases of shares of Parent Stock shall be rounded to the nearest whole
share.

 



      
 

 



 

2.7 _Post-Closing Adjustments to the Estimated Cash Amount_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date, Parent will prepare and deliver to the Stockholder
Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
Parents good faith calculation of (i) the Transaction Expenses, (ii) Working
Capital and (iii) the Company Closing Cash, and based thereon, a calculation
of the Cash Amount.

 



 

(b) During the thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement,
Parent will provide the Stockholder Representative and its accountants
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
(x) review the financial books and records of the Company, any of the
Companys accountants work papers related to the calculation of amounts in
the Closing Statement (subject to the execution of any access letters that
such accountants may require in connection with the review of such work
papers), and (y) the employees and other representatives of Parent and the
Company who were responsible for the preparation of the Closing Statement to
respond to questions relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement and
the calculation of the items thereon, in each case solely to allow the
Stockholder Representative to determine the accuracy of Parents calculation
of the items set forth on the Closing Statement. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall have any obligation to provide information or access to
information, materials or persons if doing so would reasonably be expected to
(i) unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Companys business, (ii)
result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege or the disclosure of any
trade secrets or (iii) violate any Law or the terms of any applicable Contract
to which the Company or any of its Affiliates is party. If the Stockholder
Representative disagrees with any of Parents calculations set forth in the
Closing Statement, the Stockholder Representative may, within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a written notice (the "
_Objection Notice_ ") to Parent disagreeing with such calculations; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Objection Notice shall include only objections
consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Any Objection Notice shall
specify those items or amounts with which the Stockholder Representative
disagrees, together with a detailed written explanation of the reasons for
disagreement with each such item or amount, and shall set forth the
Stockholder Representatives calculation, based on such objections, of (i) the
Transaction Expenses, (ii) the Working Capital and (iii) the Company Closing
Cash, and based thereon a calculation of the Cash Amount. To the extent not
set forth in the Objection Notice, the Stockholder Representative shall be
deemed to have agreed with Parents calculation of all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Statement. If the Stockholder Representative does not
deliver an Objection Notice within such thirty (30)-day period, then the
amounts set forth in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be final and
binding on the parties.

 



 

(c) If an Objection Notice is timely delivered pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ ,
the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, during the thirty (30) days
following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the value of the disputed items or amounts, and any discussions
relating thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and any applicable similar state rule(s) and evidence of such
discussions shall not be admissible in any future proceedings between the
parties to this Agreement. If, during such period, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent are unable to reach agreement on all disputed items,
they shall promptly thereafter mutually engage and submit such dispute to an
Independent Accounting Firm for final and binding resolution. The Independent
Accounting Firm (i) shall consider only those items or amounts disputed by the
Stockholder Representative in the Objection Notice which remain in dispute;
(ii) shall not assign a value to any item or amount in dispute greater than
the greatest value for such item or amount assigned by the Stockholder
Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, or less than
the smallest value for such item or amount assigned by the Stockholder
Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand; and (iii) shall
act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The Independent Accounting Firms
determination will be based solely on presentations by the Stockholder
Representative and Parent which are in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of independent
review) and the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to deliver to the Stockholder Representative and
Parent as promptly as

 



       
 

 



 

practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) days of its retention) a
written report setting forth its determination of the amounts in dispute. Such
report shall be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement. The cost
of such review and report shall be borne (and paid) by the Stockholder
Representative, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, based on the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if closing
accounts receivable is the only disputed item, and Parent claims that closing
accounts receivable is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the
Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative contests only
$500 of the amount claimed by Parent, and if the independent accountant
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Parent $300 of the $500 contested,
then the cost of such review and report will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷
500) to the Stockholder Representative and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Parent.

 



 

(d) If the Cash Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ ,
is less than the Estimated Cash Amount, then, within ten (10) days of the
final determination of the Cash Amount, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to the
Parent the amount of such difference from the Cash Escrow Amount in the Escrow
Account; _provided_ , _that_ , if the Cash Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account
is insufficient to cover the difference, then each Stockholder shall pay such
Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the shortfall within ten (10) days of the
final determination of the Cash Amount to Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by Parent. If the Cash
Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ , is greater than
the Estimated Cash Amount, then the amount of such excess shall be paid by
Parent, within ten (10) days of the final determination of the Cash Amount, to
each of the Stockholders and the Parent or the Second Surviving Corporation,
on behalf of the Company Optionholders, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the accounts specified in the Stockholder Transmittal
Letters based on percentages specified on Closing Consideration Schedule.

 



 

2.8 _Stockholder Representative Reserve_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article II_ , at the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause to be, deposited, in an account
designated by the Stockholder Representative at least three Business Days
prior to Closing, the Stockholder Representative Reserve, which shall be held
by the Stockholder Representative for the benefit of the Stockholders in
accordance with this _Section 2.8_.

 



 

(b) The Stockholder Representative Reserve (and interest and earnings thereon)
may be applied as the Stockholder Representative, in its sole discretion,
determines appropriate to defray, offset, or pay any charges, fees, costs,
liabilities or expenses of the Stockholder Representative incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents.

 



 

(c) The balance of the Stockholder Representative Reserve held pursuant to
this _Section 2.8_ , if any, and interest and earnings earned thereon, shall
be distributed to the Stockholders (excluding any Dissenting Stockholders) by
the Stockholder Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder
Representative Reserve shall only be so distributed when the Stockholder
Representative determines, in its sole discretion, that such distribution is
appropriate. None of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the Company, the
First Surviving Corporation, the Second Surviving Corporation or their
respective Affiliates shall have any liability or responsibility to the
Stockholders with respect to the Stockholder Representative Reserve or the
actions and responsibilities of the Stockholder Representative contemplated by
this _Section 2.8_ , and the Stockholders shall seek distribution of the
Stockholder Representative Reserve solely from the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

2.9 _Tax Consequences_. For United States federal income tax purposes, the
Mergers are intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury

 



      
 

 



 

Regulations promulgated thereunder. The parties to this Agreement adopt this
Agreement as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and Proposed Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-3(a). Each of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company shall
report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. None of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger
Sub 2 or the Company shall take any actions to prevent the Mergers from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

ARTICLE IV. _ 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 



 

Except as otherwise set forth on the Disclosure Schedules (which disclosures
shall reference the specific sections and subsections below, as applicable,
but shall also qualify other sections or subsections in this Article IV and in
the Disclosure Schedules solely to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its

do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of the assets and properties owned, leased or
licensed by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or
license necessary except where the Companys failure to be duly qualified,

Company Material Adverse Effect. Copies of the Organizational Documents of the
Company, and all amendments thereto, heretofore delivered to Parent are true,
accurate and complete as of the date hereof.

 



 

(b) The Company does not own, of record or beneficially, any direct or

Employee Benefit Plan. Each Employee Benefit Plan complies in form and in
operation, and has been administered in accordance with, its terms and the
applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws, in all
material respects. Other than routine claims for benefits, there is no Action
pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened against or with respect to
an Employee Benefit Plan and there is no fact or circumstance that would give

other pension plan subject to Title IV or Part 3 of Title I of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, (iii) "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of
Section 413(c) of the Code) or (iv) multiple employer welfare arrangement

similar state Law. The obligations of all Employee Benefit Plans that provide
health, welfare or similar insurance to any employees are fully insured by
bona fide third-party insurers.

in a material violation of, or material penalty or liability under, any of the
foregoing.

required to sponsor, maintain, participate in or contribute to, any employee
benefit plan, program, or other arrangement providing compensation or benefits

4.19 _Transactions with Certain Persons_. No Related Party (a) has any direct
or indirect financial interest in, or is an officer, director, manager,
employee or consultant of, any competitor, supplier, licensor, distributor,
lessor or customer of the Company (it being agreed, however, that the passive
ownership of securities listed on any national securities exchange
representing no more than five percent of the outstanding voting power of any
Person shall not be deemed to be a "financial interest" in any such Person);
(b) has any interest in any property, asset or right used, leased or operated
by the Company; (c) has sold any assets or capital stock of any Person to the
Company or (d) has outstanding any Indebtedness owed to the Company or is the

4.20 _Insurance_. _Section 4.20_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth a
complete and correct list of all insurance policies currently in force with
respect to the Company (the " _Insurance Policies_ "), including all
"occurrence based" liability policies, all errors and omissions policies and
all production package policies. The Insurance Policies are in full force and
effect and are valid, outstanding and enforceable. All premiums due thereon
have been timely paid and all claims under the Insurance Policies have been
timely made. No insurance claims of more than $25,000 have been made in the
past three (3) years by the Company. There are no claims outstanding made

Disclosure Schedules:

 



 

(a) The Company has duly and timely filed with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed (taking into account any
applicable extensions to file such Tax Returns). All such Tax Returns are
complete and accurate in all material respects. All Taxes due and owing by the
Company on or before the date hereof (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns)
have been timely paid. Except for United States federal and state income Tax
Returns for the Tax year ending 12/31/2015, the Company is not currently the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No
written claim has ever been made by a Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction
where the Company does not file Tax Returns that the Company is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) The unpaid Taxes of the Company did not, as of the date of the Latest
Balance Sheet, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the Latest Balance Sheet (rather than in any
notes thereto), and since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, the Company
has not incurred any Liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of
business or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.

 



 

(c) No outstanding deficiencies for Taxes with respect to the Company have
been claimed, proposed or assessed by any Governmental Authority and there are
no pending or threatened audits, assessments, investigations, disputes, claims
or other actions for or relating to any Liability in respect of Taxes of the
Company. There are no matters under discussion with any Governmental Authority
, or known to the Company, with respect to Taxes that are likely to result in
an additional Liability for Taxes with respect to the Company. No issues
relating to Taxes of the Company were raised by the relevant Governmental
Authority in any completed audit or examination that would reasonably be
expected to result in a material amount of Taxes in a later taxable period.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and
accurate copies of federal and state income Tax Returns and all other material
Tax Returns of the Company and its predecessors for all taxable years
beginning on or after January 1, 2014, including, promptly upon their
availability, for the most recent taxable year, and complete and accurate
copies of all audit or examination reports and statements of deficiencies
assessed against or agreed to by the Company (or any predecessor of the
Company) since December 31, 2013, with respect to Taxes of any type. The
Company (or any predecessor of the Company) has not waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency that is still in effect, nor has any
request been made in writing for any such extension or waiver. No power of
attorney (other than powers of attorney authorizing employees of the Company
to act on behalf of the Company) with respect to any Taxes is currently in
force or has been executed or filed with any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(e) There are no Encumbrances for Taxes upon any property or asset of the
Company (other than for current Taxes not yet due and payable).

 



 

(f) All Taxes required to have been withheld, collected, deposited or paid, as
the case may be, in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party, by the
Company have been timely withheld, collected, deposited or paid.

 



 

(g) The Company will not be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any period (or any
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any installment
sale or other transaction on or prior to the Closing Date, any accounting
method change or agreement with any Governmental Authority filed or made on or
prior to the Closing Date, any prepaid amount received on or prior to the
Closing, or any election under Section 108(i) of the Code.

 



 

(h) There are no Tax sharing agreements, Tax allocation agreements or similar
arrangements (including indemnity arrangements) with respect to or involving
the Company.

 



 

(i) The Company has not been a member of an "affiliated group" (within the
meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code) filing a consolidated federal income
Tax Return or any similar group for federal, state, local or foreign Tax
purposes (other than a group the common parent of which is the Company). The
Company does not have any Liability for the Taxes of any other Person under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by Contract, or
otherwise.

 



 

(j) The Company (A) does not own and will not own at the Closing a "United
States real property interest" within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the
Code and (B) has not been, at any time during the five-year period ending on
the Closing Date, a "United States real property holding corporation" within
the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. No amounts are required to be
withheld pursuant to Section 1445 upon the First Merger pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

(k) The Company (i) has not been a stockholder of a "controlled foreign
corporation" as defined in Section 957 of the Code (or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign law); (ii) has not been a stockholder of a "passive
foreign investment company" within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code;

become subject to Tax jurisdiction in a country other than the country of its
formation.

 



      
 

 



 

(l) The Company has not been a party to a transaction that is or is
substantially similar to a "reportable transaction," as such term is defined
in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(1), or any other transaction
requiring disclosure under analogous provisions of state, local or foreign Tax
law. If the Company has entered into any transaction such that, if the
treatment claimed by it were to be disallowed, the transaction would
constitute a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the
meaning of Section 6662 of the Code, then the Company believes that it has
either (x) substantial authority for the tax treatment of such transaction or
(y) disclosed on its Tax Return the relevant facts affecting the tax treatment
of such transaction. The Company has not participated, and does not plan to
participate, in any Tax amnesty program.

 



 

(m) The Company has not elected at any time to be treated as an "S
corporation" within the meaning of Sections 1361 or 1362 of the Code (or any
similar provision of state or local law).

 



 

(n) The Company has not constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code. The Company has not acquired any assets from any
other corporation in a transaction in which the adjusted Tax basis in the
acquired assets was determined by reference (in whole or in part) to the
adjusted Tax basis of the acquired assets (or any other property) in the hands
of the transferor.

 



 

(o) The Company is not a partner for Tax purposes with respect to any joint
venture, partnership or other arrangement which is treated as a partnership
for Tax purposes.

 



 

(p) Each Employee Benefit Plan and each other contract, agreement, plan,
program or arrangement maintained, established or entered into by the Company
that constitutes a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code) has been (i) operated in good faith
compliance with Section 409A of the Code or an available exemption therefrom
from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008 (to the extent in existence
during such period) and (ii) maintained and operated, since January 1, 2010
(to the extent in existence since such date), in documentary and operational
compliance with Section 409A or the Code. No compensation has been or would
reasonably be expected to be includable in the gross income of any "service
provider" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) of the Company as a
result of the operation of Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(q) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, either alone or in combination with another event (whether contingent
or otherwise) may result in any "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the
Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law).

 



 

(r) There is no Contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which the Company
is a party which requires the Company to pay a Tax gross-up or reimbursement
payment to any Person, including without limitation, with respect to any Tax-
related payments under Section 409A of the Code or Section 280G or 4999 of the
Code.

connection with the performance of services subject to a substantial risk of
forfeiture within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code, such substantial risk
of forfeiture has lapsed.

provides no representations as to the amount or usability of any net operating
losses reflected on any Tax Returns of the Company.

has been, in compliance with, and has not been and is not in violation of or
liable under any applicable Laws relating to environmental matters ("
_Environmental Laws_ "). There are no claims, notices, civil, criminal or
administrative Actions, inquiries, common law claims, or proceedings pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company that
allege the violation of any Environmental Law. The Company has not caused or
contributed to a release of hazardous substances (as defined under applicable
Environmental Law) including polychlorinated biphenyls, asbestos, lead paint
or toxic mold in amounts or concentrations creating Liability under
Environmental Law. The Company has furnished to Parent all reports or
communications (in written or electronic form) in its possession or the
possession of lenders, insurers, consultants and advisors relating to
compliance in respect of, or Liability under, Environmental Law.

(12) months decreased materially, or threatened to decrease or limit
materially, its supply of services or products to, or purchase of products or

employees, stockholders, representatives or Affiliates has employed or made
any agreement with any broker, finder or similar agent or any Person which
will result in the obligation of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates to pay any finders fee, brokerage fees or commission or
similar payment in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

businesses as presently conducted. Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 are

are in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the assets
and properties owned, leased or licensed by them or the nature of their

 



      
 

 



 

businesses makes such qualification or license necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not have a
material adverse effect on Parents, Merger Sub 1s or Merger Sub 2s ability

discharge its obligations under, this Agreement.

 



 

5.11 _Compliance with Laws_. Parent is not in breach or default of any
provisions of its Organizational Documents. Parent and its officers and
directors (in their capacities as such) are in compliance with all Laws and
Orders applicable to the Parent, except where failure to be in compliance
would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.12 _Financing_. Parent will, when payments required under _Section 2.5_
become payable, have sufficient currently available funds on hand (including,
for these purposes, funds that currently may be drawn down under lines of
credit) to make such payments.

 



 

5.13 _No Material Adverse Effect_. Between March 31, 2016 and the date of this
Agreement, there has not occurred any Parent Material Adverse Effect.

systems or procedures), software, publicity rights, privacy rights and all
other intellectual property (including all goodwill associated with, and
registrations and applications for registration of, any of the foregoing)
(collectively, " _Parent Intellectual Property_ ") material to the conduct of
the business of Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, as conducted or
proposed to be conducted, and the conduct of their respective businesses does
not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any intellectual property rights of
others in any material respect. To Parents actual knowledge, no party has
materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual
Property owned by or exclusively licensed to Parent or any of its
subsidiaries. There is no material pending, or to Parents actual knowledge,
threatened, action, suit, proceeding or claim by others (A) alleging that
Parent is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Intellectual
Property of others, or (B) challenging Parents or

 



       
 

 



 

its subsidiaries rights in or to, or the validity, enforceability, scope or
ownership of, any Parent Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to Parent
or its subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) The Parent has complied at all times with all applicable Laws, and
relevant agreements to which the Parent is a party, regarding the collection,
retention, use, acquisition, recording, storage, distribution, disposal,
transfer, disclosure, processing and security of Personal Information,

to, the Person subject of Personal Information to the fullest extent
necessary. All such Personal Information (whether automatically or manually
recorded) held by the Parent is adequate, relevant and not excessive for the
purposes for which it is held and has not been kept for longer than necessary.
The Parent has implemented and maintained a privacy policy regarding the
collection, retention, use, acquisition, recording, storage, distribution,
disposal, transfer, disclosure, processing and security of Personal
Information in connection with the operation of its business and (i) the
Parents privacy practices are and have been in compliance with all such
privacy policies at the time such privacy policy was in effect, (ii) the
Parents information security practices are and have been in compliance with
any information security statements in its privacy policies at the time each
such privacy policy was in effect and (iii) the Parent has posted such privacy
policy in a clear and conspicuous location on all websites and any mobile
applications owned or operated by or on behalf of the Parent. No Person
(including any Governmental Authority) has made any written or, to the actual
knowledge of the Parent, oral claim or commenced any written or, to the actual
knowledge of the Parent, oral Action, and, to the actual knowledge of the
Parent, no claim or Action is threatened (y) alleging a violation of any
Persons privacy or confidentiality rights under the Parents privacy policies
or applicable Law or (z) with respect to the security, use, transfer or
disclosure of Personal Information specifically. The Parent has fulfilled in
compliance with applicable Law all requests from the subjects of Personal
Information to access, remove or update such Personal Information stored by or
on behalf of the Parent. Neither this Agreement, nor any other Transaction
Document to which the Parent is a party, nor the consummation of the
Transactions will violate any of the Parents applicable privacy policies as
they currently exist or as they existed at any time during which any Personal
Information was collected or obtained. The Parent has established and
implemented policies, programs, procedures that conform with applicable
industry practices and all requirements of Law, including administrative,
technical and physical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity
and security of Personal Information in its possession, custody or control
against unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or other misuse. To
the actual knowledge of the Parent, the Parent has not experienced any loss,
damage, or unauthorized access, disclosure, use or breach of security of any
Personal Information in its possession, custody or control, or otherwise held
or processed on its behalf.

 



 

(c) To the extent that the Parent receives, processes, transmits or stores any
Cardholder Data, the Parent has implemented information security procedures,
processes and systems that have at all times met or exceeded all applicable
Laws related to the collection, storage, processing and transmission of
Cardholder Data, including those established by applicable Governmental
Authorities, and the Payment Card Industry Standards Council (including the
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).

 



 

5.15 _Taxes_. Except as would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

Authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed (taking into account any
applicable extensions to file such Tax Returns). All such Tax Returns are
complete and accurate in all material respects.

 



 

(b) All Taxes due and owing by Parent on or before the date hereof have been
timely paid (or adequate reserves have been established therefor).

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Parent has no knowledge of any assessments or adjustments relating to any
Liability in respect of Taxes of Parent pending or threatened against Parent
for any period.

 



 

5.16 _No Brokers_. None of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2, nor any of
their respective representatives or Affiliates has employed or made any
agreement with any broker, finder or similar agent or any Person which will
result in the obligation of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 or any of
their respective Affiliates to pay any finders fee, brokerage fees or

Company shall deliver to Parent (i) a written consent of the Stockholders

6.4 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared or
timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company that are required to be filed
(taking into account any extension) on or before the Closing Date, and shall
pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the Company due on or before the
Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Company, except
as required by applicable law. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to filing
any such Tax Return, the Company shall submit a copy of such Tax Return to
Parent for Parents review and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(ii) The Stockholder Representative shall timely prepare, or cause to be
timely prepared, all Tax Returns for the Company for any periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date and Parent
shall cause the Company to file such Tax Returns. Parent shall prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns for the Company for any Straddle Periods. At least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date of any such Tax Return, the
Stockholder Representative or Parent, as applicable, shall submit a copy of
such Tax Return to Parent or Stockholder Representative, as applicable, for
review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. The Stockholders shall be responsible for all Taxes
relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period payable in connection with such Tax
Returns to the extent such Taxes have not been taken into account in
determining the Working Capital. The Stockholder Representative shall make the
payment due to Parent for the Stockholders share of Taxes relating to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period under this _Section 6.4(a)(ii)_ at least two (2)
Business Days before payment of Taxes (including estimated Taxes) is due to
the Governmental Authority. For purposes of this Agreement, the pre-closing
portion of any Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period will
be (i) in the case of Property Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes,
determined as though the taxable year of the Company terminated at the close
of business on the Closing Date.

 



 

(iii) Except as specifically provided in _Section 6.4(b)_, neither Parent or
the Second Surviving Corporation, nor any of its Affiliates shall (or after
the Closing, shall cause or permit the Second Surviving Corporation to) file,
amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of
limitation with respect to) any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the
Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written
consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 



 

(i) Parent, the Second Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder
Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Agreement and any Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records
and information which may be reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax
Contest and making appropriate persons available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Parent, the Second Surviving Corporation and the
Stockholder Representative agree (i) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Tax period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the relevant
statutes of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or Stockholder
Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered

 



      
 

 



 

into with any Governmental Authority and (ii) to give to the other Person
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other Person so requests, the Second
Surviving Corporation or the Stockholder Representative, as the case may be,
shall allow the other Person to take possession of such books and records.

 



 

(ii) Parent, the Second Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder
Representative further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne one-half
by the Parent and one-half by the Stockholders. Each of the Parent and the
Stockholder Representative hereby agrees to file, or cause to be filed, in a
timely manner all necessary documents (including, but not limited to, all Tax
Returns) with respect to such Transfer Taxes. Each of the Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall provide to each other with evidence
satisfactory to the receiving party that such Transfer Taxes have been paid by
the Parent and (or on behalf of) the Stockholders, as applicable.

 



 

(d) _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(i) Each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing upon receipt
by such party or any of their respective Affiliates of notice of any pending
or threatened federal, state, local or foreign audits, examinations, claims,
assessments or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes of the
Company (a " _Tax Contest_ ") for which such party is entitled to seek, or is
seeking or intends to seek, indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Article VIII_, the Stockholder Representative shall
have the right, in good faith, to control and to represent the interests of
the Company in and with respect to any Tax Contest for any Tax period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date and to employ counsel of its own choice for
such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall be entitled to participate
at its expense in or with respect to any such Tax Contest. The Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to settle or compromise, or agree to
settle or compromise, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any Tax Contest for any Tax period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , no such settlement, compromise or
agreement shall be effectuated without Parents prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Parent shall have
the right, in good faith, to control and to represent the interests of the
Company in and with respect to any Tax Contest for any Straddle Period;
_provided_ , _however_ , the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to
participate at its expense in or with respect to any such Tax Contest. Parent
shall have the right to settle or compromise, or agree to settle or
compromise, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation,
any Tax Contest for any Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ , no such
settlement, compromise or agreement shall be effectuated without the
Stockholder Representatives prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

6.5 _FIRPTA Compliance_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a properly executed statement, dated as of the Closing Date, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and that satisfies the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3), together with the required notice
to the IRS and written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice and a
copy of such statement to the IRS on behalf of the Company upon the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

6.6 _Publicity_. Parent and the Company shall mutually agree upon a joint
initial press release concerning this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, which shall be disseminated at such time and in such
manner as is agreed by Parent and the Company (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). After such initial press release is
disseminated, the Company and Parent will consult with each other and will
mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining to
the transactions and shall not issue any such press releases or make any such
public announcements prior to such consultation and agreement (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as may be required
by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any agreement with any
national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
issuing any such press releases or making any such public announcements;
_provided_ , _that_ , Parent may make any public statement to the press,
analysts, investors, lenders, rating agencies, proxy advisory firms or those
attending industry conferences or Parent conference calls, so long as such
statements are substantially similar to previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company (or
individually, if approved by the other party).

 



 

6.7 _Confidentiality_. As an owner of Company Capital Stock, each Stockholder
has had access to and contributed to information and materials of a highly
sensitive nature (including Confidential Information) of the businesses of the
Company. By executing a Stockholder Transmittal Letter, each Stockholder
agrees that unless such Stockholder first secures the written consent of an
authorized representative of Parent, such Stockholder shall not (except on
behalf of Parent or pursuant to the terms of such Stockholders employment
agreement with the Company or Parent) use for himself, herself, itself or
anyone else, and shall not disclose to others, any Confidential Information
relating to the business of the Company, except (a) to the extent necessary to
comply with the Law, a Governmental Authority or a valid court order of a
court with competent jurisdiction, in which event such Stockholder shall so
notify Parent as promptly as is practicable (if possible, prior to making such
disclosure) and shall seek confidential treatment of such information; (b) to
its auditors and attorneys and similar professionals ( _provided_ , _that_ ,
such Stockholder shall be liable in the event that any such permitted
recipients disclose any information that such Stockholder would be prohibited
from disclosing pursuant to this provision); or (c) in order to enforce its
rights pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

6.8 _Waiver and Release_.

 



 

(a) By executing a Stockholder Transmittal Letter, each Stockholder, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates, officers, directors, partners, employees,
members, managers, trustees, successors and assigns of each of them (but, for
clarity, excluding the Company) (collectively, the " _Releasors_ ") hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably releases and discharges the Company, its
Affiliates (including Parent), and the members, managers, employees, officers,
directors, successors and assigns of each of them (collectively, the "
_Releasees_ ") in each case from any and all claims, demands, liens, actions,

fees, expenses, damages, judgments, orders and liabilities, of whatever kind
or nature, at law, in equity or otherwise, whether now known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected, fixed or contingent or choate or inchoate, and
whether or not concealed or hidden, which such Releasor ever had, now has or
hereafter can, shall or may have against any Releasee for, upon or by reason
of any matter, fact or circumstance occurring or arising at any time on or
prior to the Closing Date in any way relating to the Company; _provided_ ,
_that_ , the foregoing shall not affect any rights that any Releasor may have
pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or any rights to
indemnification or reimbursement under the Companys Organizational Documents
as in effect as of the date hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) By executing a Stockholder Transmittal Letter, each Stockholder, on behalf
of itself and the other Releasors, irrevocably covenants to refrain from,
directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing,
instituting or causing to be commenced, any proceeding of any kind against any
Releasee based upon any matter released pursuant to this _Section 6.8_.

 



 

6.9 _Exclusivity_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through Affiliates or
otherwise: (i) enter into any agreement for the sale, lease, pledge or other
disposition of all or any significant part of the assets, or for the sale of

consolidation or other acquisition proposal involving the Company with any
other party, or enter into any transaction similar to the foregoing in format
or purpose, with any party other than Parent; (ii) issue, sell, pledge, or
otherwise transfer or dispose of any shares, notes or other securities of the
Company to any party other than to Parent; (iii) enter into any transaction
outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices in
contemplation of any transaction described above with any party other than
Parent or (iv) encourage, initiate, solicit, discuss, consider, pursue,
provide information to or negotiate with any party, other than Parent, to do
any of the foregoing.

 



 

6.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the Second Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present officers and directors of the Company (the " _Covered Parties_ ")
to the same extent and in the same manner and subject to the same limits as
such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to the DGCL, the Organizational Documents of the Company and any
indemnification agreements set forth on _Section 6.10_ of the Disclosure
Schedules, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company may purchase tail insurance
coverage for the Companys directors and officers in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent, which provides such directors and
officers with coverage for six years following the Closing Date with respect
to claims arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing Date (the " _D andO Tail Policy_"). For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company shall bear the cost of obtaining the DandO Tail Policy and such cost
shall be included in Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(c) The covenants contained in this _Section 6.10_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Covered Parties and their
respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which a Covered Party is entitled, whether pursuant to
law, contract or otherwise.

 



 

(d) In the event that the Second Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of the Second
Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns, as the
case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.10_.

 



 

6.11 _Further Assurances_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained herein, the parties agree, both before and after the Closing, (a) to
use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (b) to execute any documents,
instruments or conveyances of any kind which may be

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably necessary or advisable to carry out any of the transactions
contemplated hereunder or thereunder and (c) to cooperate with each other in
connection with the foregoing.

 



 

6.12 _Legal Representation_. All communications involving attorney-client
confidences among the Company Entities and Snell and Wilmer L.L.P. in the course
of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the Stockholders (and not the First
Surviving Corporation, Second Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries or
Affiliates, including Parent) and may be controlled by the Stockholder
Representative. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and
after the Closing, (a) the Stockholders and their Affiliates (and not the
First Surviving Corporation, Second Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries
or Affiliates, including Parent) will be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the " _Pre-Merger Communications_ "), and none of the First Surviving
Corporation, Second Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including Parent) will be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of
Snell and Wilmer L.L.P. with respect to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute
property of the client, only the Stockholders and their Affiliates will hold
such property rights and (c) Snell and Wilmer L.L.P. will not have any duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose the Pre-Merger Communications or files
pertaining to the Pre-Merger Communications to the First Surviving
Corporation, Second Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or
Affiliates (including Parent) by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between any of Snell and Wilmer L.L.P. and the Company or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the
First Surviving Corporation, Second Surviving Corporation or their
subsidiaries or Affiliates, including Parent, on the one hand, and a third
party other than the Stockholders, on the other hand, Parent may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Pre-Merger
Communications to such third party or waive such privilege if desired in
connection with resolving such dispute. In the event that Parent is legally
required or requested by governmental order or otherwise (any such request or
order, a " _Legal Request_ ") to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion
of the Pre-Merger Communications, Parent shall be entitled to access or obtain
a copy of and disclose the Pre-Merger Communications to the extent necessary
to comply with any such Legal Request. In the event of any Legal Request,
Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder Representative in writing (prior
to the disclosure by Parent of any Pre-Merger Communications to the extent
practicable) so that the Stockholder Representative can seek a protective
order and Parent agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts (at the
sole cost and expense of the Stockholder Representative) to assist therewith.

 



 

6.13 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing, the
Parent shall or shall cause the Company to provide each employee who remains
employed immediately after the Closing (" _Company Continuing Employee_ "),
while such Company Continuing Employee remains employed, with: (i) subject to
the terms of any employment agreements to be entered into in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, base salary or hourly wages
which are no less than the base salary or hourly wages provided by the Company
as of April 29, 2016; and (ii) other cash compensation and employee benefits
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by Parent
to employees generally.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan retained or maintained by Parent

Fundamental Representations or in the case of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct.

 



 

(b) (i) No amount shall be payable to the Stockholder Indemnitees in
satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_
unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses of the Stockholder

which time the Stockholder Indemnitees shall have the right to recover all

this _Article VIII_ for any Losses in excess, in the aggregate, of the total
value of the consideration payable to such Stockholder hereunder (including

(and in the event of fraud, only with respect to the Stockholder who committed

pursuant to this _Article VIII_ for any Losses in excess, in the aggregate,

Parent Stock Value), except in the case of fraud.

 



 

8.4 _Direct Claims Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) If a Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder (an " _Indemnified
Party_ "), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a written demand (a " _Claim
Certificate_ ") to Parent (in the case of an

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification claim from a Stockholder Indemnitee) or the Stockholder
Representative (in the case of an indemnification claim from a Parent
Indemnitee), as applicable (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), which Claim
Certificate shall contain a description of, and if reasonably determinable at
the time such demand is delivered, the amount of any Losses incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred by such Indemnified Party and a reasonable
explanation of the basis therefor. The failure to provide such notice to the
Indemnifying Party shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations under
this _Article VIII_ except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
is materially prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not, within thirty (30) days
of the receipt thereof, object to any claim or claims made in any Claim
Certificate pursuant to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver
or cause to be distributed by the Escrow Agent, as applicable, to the
Indemnified Party an amount equal to the Losses set forth in the Claim
Certificate arising out of any claim or claims that are not objected to by the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(c) In case the Indemnifying Party shall object in writing to any claim or
claims made in any Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified
Party shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by the applicable Parties, and the Indemnifying
Party shall deliver or cause to be distributed by the Escrow Agent, as
applicable, to the Indemnified Party the amount set forth in such memorandum
in accordance with the terms thereof. In the event that the Parties are not
able to reach an agreement, or the memorandum contains an agreement as to only
a portion of the Losses in question, the parties may resolve such dispute in
the manner provided in _Section 10.5_.

 



 

8.5 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) A party seeking indemnification hereunder in connection with a claim by
any Person other than the Indemnified Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") shall
provide prompt notice of such Third-Party Claim to Parent (in the case of an
indemnification claim from a Stockholder Indemnitee) or the Stockholder
Representative (in the case of an indemnification claim from a Parent
Indemnitee), as applicable, which notice describes in reasonable detail such
Third-Party Claim and copies of all material evidence and correspondence in
connection therewith (a " _Third-Party Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _that_ ,
the failure to provide such Third-Party Claim Notice shall not affect an
Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Article VIII_ except and only to
the extent that an Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure. Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 8.5(a)_, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, in its discretion and at its expense,
to participate in and control the defense or settlement of such Third-Party
Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; _provided_
, _that_ , the Indemnifying Party may control the defense or settlement of
such Third-Party Claim only if (i) the claim does not seek an injunction or
other equitable relief; (ii) the claim does not involve criminal allegations,
a Governmental Authority, or any material supplier, customer, or other partner
to the business conducted by the Company; (iii) the Indemnifying Party admits
that such Third-Party Claim is indemnifiable pursuant to this _Article VIII_
and that the Indemnifying Party will pay any Losses arising therefrom (subject
to the limitations in this _Article VIII_); (iv) such Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim within thirty (30) days of
receipt by the Indemnifying Party of notice of such Third-Party Claim and a
reasonable description of such Third-Party Claim; (v) such Indemnifying Party
conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim diligently and (vi) the
Indemnifying Party is not a party to the Third-Party Claim and counsel for the
Indemnifying Party has determined in good faith that there would be no
conflict of interest or other inappropriate matter associated with joint
representation. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third-
Party Claim, (A) the Indemnified Party shall, at its own cost and expense, be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and to employ
separate counsel of its choice for such purpose and (B) the Indemnifying Party
shall keep the Indemnified Party

 



      
 

 



 

apprised of all developments, including settlement offers, with respect to the
Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim related to the matters set
forth on _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_ of the Disclosure Schedules shall be determined
as set forth on _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_ of the Disclosure Schedules.

 



 

(b) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, neither party shall not admit to any Liability with respect
to, consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge,
any Third-Party Claim for which indemnity is sought without the prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of the other
party; _provided_ , _that_ , an Indemnified Party shall have no obligation of
any kind to consent to the entrance of any judgment or into any settlement
unless such judgment or settlement (i) is for only money damages, the full
amount of which shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party, and (ii) includes, as
a condition thereof, an express, unconditional release of the Indemnified
Party from any liability or obligation with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not control the defense of the Third-Party
Claim (or at any time ceases to become eligible to control the defense
pursuant to _Section 8.5(a)_), (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against,
and consent to the entry of any judgment or, subject to _Section 8.5(b)_,
enter into any settlement with respect to, the Third-Party Claim in any manner
it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or
obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), (ii)
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is liable for such Losses under this
_Article VIII_, the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party
promptly and periodically (but no less often than monthly) for the costs of
defending against the Third-Party Claim, including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel engaged by the Indemnified Party and (iii) to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is liable for such Losses under this _Article VIII_,
the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified
Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as result of, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with the Third-Party Claim to the fullest extent
provided in this _Article VIII_.

 



 

8.6 _Effect of Knowledge or Waiver of Condition_. The right to
indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy based on any
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements will not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment
of Losses, or other remedies based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements.

 



 

8.7 _Escrow Amount_.

 



 

(a) If a Parent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder pursuant
to _Section 8.2(a)_, such Parent Indemnitee shall first recover any Losses
from the Escrow Account, and to the extent the Losses recoverable exceed the
then-remaining Escrow Amount, such Parent Indemnitee may, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_, recover any remaining Losses
directly from the Stockholders severally but not jointly in accordance with
_Section 8.2(a)_. With respect to Losses recovered from the Escrow Account,
Parent shall (i) recover 36% of the Losses from the Cash Escrow Amount and
(ii) recover 64% of the Losses from the Stock Escrow Amount; _provided_ ,
_that_ , to the extent that either the Cash Escrow Amount or the Stock Escrow
Amount has been exhausted, or Losses recoverable in accordance with the
foregoing sentence exceed the then-remaining available amount of either the
Cash Escrow Amount or the Stock Escrow Amount, the foregoing sentence shall
not apply, and Parent shall be

 



      
 

 



 

permitted to recover Losses from any amount of cash or Parent Stock remaining
from either the Cash Escrow Amount or the Stock Escrow Amount; and _provided_
, _further_ , that Losses recoverable in respect of the matters set forth on
_Section 4.21(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedules shall be recoverable solely
from the Cash Escrow Amount.

 



 

(b) Within five Business Days after the resolution of any claim for
indemnification for which a Parent Indemnitee is entitled to recover Losses
from the Escrow Account, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver from the Escrow Account to such
Parent Indemnitee the amount of such Losses. Within five Business Day after
the resolution of any claim for indemnification for which a Parent Indemnitee
is entitled to recover Losses directly from a Stockholder, such Stockholder
shall deliver to such Parent Indemnitee the amount for which it is directly
responsible.

 



 

8.8 _No Contribution_. No Equityholder shall have, and no Equityholder shall
exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of
contribution or reimbursement from, subrogation to, or right of indemnity
against the First Surviving Corporation or the Second Surviving Corporation,
in connection with any indemnification obligation to a Parent Indemnitee to
which such Equityholder may become subject under or in connection with this
Agreement. No Equityholder shall assert any claims against any directors and
officers insurance policy maintained or to be maintained by or for the benefit
of the Company, the First Surviving Corporation or the Second Surviving
Corporation in respect of amounts due by the Stockholder to any Parent
Indemnitee under this _Article VIII_ or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement. From and after the First Effective Time, the Equityholders, hereby
irrevocably waive and release the First Surviving Corporation and the Second
Surviving Corporation from any such right of contribution or right of
indemnity from or against the First Surviving Corporation and the Second
Surviving Corporation with respect to indemnification payments to Parent
Indemnitees pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

8.9 _Indemnification Sole Remedy_. Except (a) for the ability of the parties
to obtain equitable remedies in connection with any breach or threatened
breach of any of the covenants and agreements of the parties set forth herein;
(b) in the case of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct
by any party and (c) with respect to _Section 6.7_ or _Section 6.8_, (i) the
indemnification rights provided pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent Indemnitees and the Stockholder
Indemnitees and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
Affiliates, agents, representatives, successors and assigns for any breach of
any representations and warranties and covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement and the matters set forth on _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_ and
_Section 4.21(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedules; and (ii) each of the foregoing
hereby irrevocably waives any right to any remedy relating to any such breach
or Losses from the matters set forth on _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_ and _Section
4.21(f) _of the Disclosure Schedules other than the indemnification rights
provided pursuant to this _Article VIII_ (whether by contract, common law,
statute, regulation or otherwise).

 



 

8.10 _Tax Consequences of Payments_. Any payments made to an Indemnified
Party pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this _Article VIII_
(or pursuant to _Section 6.4_) will be treated as adjustments to the purchase
price for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties
shall file their respective Tax Returns accordingly and such agreed treatment
will govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by law.

 



 

8.11 _Losses Net of Insurance_. Any Losses otherwise indemnifiable under this
_Article VIII_ shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payments actually recovered by a
Parent Indemnitee or a Stockholder Indemnitee, as applicable, in respect of
such Losses (but net of costs of collection, deductibles and premium increases
resulting from such recovery). Prior to seeking indemnification under this
Agreement, a Parent Indemnitee or 


      
 

 



 

Stockholder Indemnitee, as applicable, shall consider in good faith seeking
recovery under applicable insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or
other similar agreements for any Losses to the same extent it would if such
Loss were its own and not subject to indemnification under this Agreement;
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, a Parent Indemnitee or
Stockholder Indemnitee shall not be subject to any liability for failing to
seek recovery under any insurance policy prior to seeking indemnification
under this Agreement.

and provisions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement or any provision hereof; _provided_ , _however_
, that any Person that is not a party to this Agreement but, by the terms of
_Article VIII_, is entitled to indemnification, shall be considered a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement, with full rights of enforcement as though
such Person was a signatory to this Agreement.

 



 

10.18 _Appointment of the Stockholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) By executing this Agreement, the Company (and, upon execution of a
Stockholder Transmittal Letter, each Stockholder) shall be deemed to have
constituted and appointed, effective from and after the date of this
Agreement, Frontier Fund IV, L.P., as the agent and attorney-in-fact, with
full power and authority to act, including power of substitution, for and on
behalf of each Stockholder to act as the Stockholder Representative under this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall take any and all actions required,
permitted, necessary or appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf of
Stockholders as if the Stockholders were acting on their own behalf,
including:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) taking any and all actions (including, without limitation, executing and
delivering any documents and incurring any costs and expenses on behalf of the
Stockholders) and making any and all determinations which may be required or
permitted in connection with the post-Closing implementation of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby;

 



 

(ii) giving and receiving notices and communications under this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements;

 



 

(iii) negotiating, defending, settling, compromising and otherwise handling
and resolving any and all claims and disputes with Parent and any other Parent
Indemnitees arising out of or in respect of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, including, without limitation, claims and disputes pursuant to
_Article VIII_;

 



 

(iv) retaining legal counsel, accountants, consultants and other experts in
connection with all matters and things set forth or necessary with respect to
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby; and

 



 

(v) making any other decision or election or exercising such rights, power and
authority as are incidental to the foregoing.

 



 

(c) Upon execution of a Stockholder Transmittal Letter, each Stockholder
acknowledges and agrees that upon any delivery by the Stockholder
Representative of any waiver, amendment, agreement, opinion, certificate or
other document executed by the Stockholder Representative, such Stockholder
shall be bound by such documents as fully as if such Stockholder had executed
and delivered such documents.

 



 

(d) Upon the resignation, death, disability or incapacity of the initial
Stockholder Representative, then such Person as is appointed by the
Stockholders who held a majority of the voting power of the Company Capital
Stock immediately prior to the Closing shall become the Stockholder
Representative; _provided_ , _that_ , no change in the Stockholder
Representative shall be effective prior to the delivery to Parent of written
notice thereof from such Stockholders. The Stockholder Representative shall
not receive compensation for service in such capacity.

 



 

(e) Any and all actions taken or not taken, exercises of rights, power or
authority and any decision or determination made by the Stockholder
Representative in connection herewith shall be absolutely and irrevocably
binding upon the Stockholders as if such Stockholder had taken such action,
exercised such rights, power or authority or made such decision or
determination in its individual capacity, and Parent may rely upon such
action, exercise of right, power, or authority or such decision or
determination of the Stockholder Representative as the action, exercise,
right, power, or authority, or decision or determination of such Stockholders,
and no Stockholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to
any Person for any acts done by the Stockholder Representative and any acts
done by Parent in accordance with any decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(f) This appointment of agency and this power of attorney is coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any
Stockholder or by operation of law. Neither the Stockholder Representative nor
any agent employed by it shall incur any liability to any Stockholder by
virtue of the failure or refusal of the Stockholder Representative for any
reason to consummate the transactions related to this Agreement or relating to
the performance of its other duties hereunder or any of its omissions or
actions with respect thereto. The Stockholders, jointly and severally, agree
to

 



      
 

 



 

indemnify the Stockholder Representative, its successors, assigns, agents,
attorneys and affiliates (the " _Stockholder Representative Parties_ ") and to
hold the Stockholder Representative Parties harmless against any and all
losses, liabilities or expenses incurred without bad faith on the part of the
Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with its duties
as Stockholder Representative, including the reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Stockholder Representative in defending against any claim or
liability in connection herewith or any Ancillary Agreement.
