information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l
promulgated thereunder which, unless Parent otherwise elects, shall be so
mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the Company,

the Exchange Act and NYSE rules and, at least one of whom shall be an "audit

and the instructions thereto (the Continuing Directors); _provided, however_ ,
that if the number of Continuing Directors is reduced below three for any
reason, the remaining Continuing Directors shall be entitled to elect or
designate a person meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancy who
shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement or,
if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate
three persons meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancies, and such
persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. The Company and the Company Board shall promptly take all action as
may be necessary to comply with their obligations under this Section 1.3(c).

Director, any amendment or termination of this Agreement requiring action by
the Company Board, any extension of time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or the Purchaser under this Agreement, any

Company in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.6(a). The
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand,
agree to promptly correct any information provided by such party for use in
the Proxy Statement, if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the Proxy Statement, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and, if any such correction is made
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, mailed to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall
provide Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Proxy Statement promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent, the Purchaser and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any
such written responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, the
Purchaser and their counsel. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in
accordance with applicable Law: (i) duly set a record date for, and within
three Business Days after receipt of SEC clearance of the Proxy Statement (or
ten days after the preliminary Proxy Statement has been filed with the SEC and
no comments thereon have been received from the SEC), call and give notice of
a special meeting of its stockholders (the Special Meeting) for the purpose
of considering and taking action upon this Agreement (with the record date and
meeting date to be set for a date after the Acceptance Time and in
consultation with Parent); (ii) as promptly as practicable after clearance of
the Proxy Statement from the SEC (or ten days after the preliminary Proxy
Statement has been filed with the SEC and no comments thereon have been
received from the SEC), print and mail the Proxy Statement to
the stockholders of the Company; and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger, and secure any approval of the
stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law to effect the
Merger; _provided_ , that, in each case, (A) the Company shall not change the
date of, postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting without Parents prior
written consent and (B) Parent may cause the Company to postpone or adjourn
the Special Meeting to a date that is not later than five Business Days prior
to the Outside Date by prior written notice to the Company, if required by
applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment
thereof, Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned
of record by Parent or the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the
Purchaser otherwise has, directly or indirectly, voting power in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to deliver or provide (or cause to be delivered or provided), in its capacity
as a stockholder of the Company, any other stockholder approvals that are
required by applicable Law to effect the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
 



   1.7 | Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding the terms of Section 1.6, if after the Acceptance Time and, if
applicable, the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by the
Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement and, if applicable, the exercise
of the Top-Up Option, Parent and the Purchaser shall then hold of record, in
the aggregate, at least 90% of the outstanding Shares (the Short Form
Threshold), the parties hereto agree to take all reasonably necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as

 



9  promptly as practicable without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 



   1.8 | Top-Up Option. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Company hereby grants to the Purchaser an irrevocable
option (the Top-Up Option), exercisable only after the Acceptance Time and
only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to
purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price an aggregate number of
Shares (the Top-Up Option Shares) equal to the lowest number of Shares that,
when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent or Purchaser or any of
Parents wholly-owned Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares
immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares;  _provided,
however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not exceed the number of Shares then
authorized and unissued and not reserved for issuance under the Company
Benefits Plans as of the date hereof (including as authorized and unissued
Shares, for purposes of this Section 1.8, any Shares held in the treasury of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, Available Shares)) and
shall not be exercisable if immediately after exercise and issuance of all
Available Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option, the Short Form Threshold
would not be reached; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Top-Up Option may not
be exercisable on more than one occasion. Upon Parents request, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify
in writing to Parent the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Purchaser may
pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option
Shares either entirely in cash or, at the Purchasers election, by paying (x)
in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-
Up Option Shares and (y) at the sole election of Guarantor, either Parent and
Purchaser or Guarantor executing and delivering to the Company a promissory
note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase
price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash (the
Promissory Note). The Promissory Note shall be unsecured, full recourse to, at
the sole election of Guarantor, either Parent and Purchaser or Guarantor,
non-negotiable and non-transferable, bear simple interest at 2% per annum,
shall provide that principal and interest is due one year after the purchase
of the Top-Up Option Shares, shall be prepayable in whole or in part
without premium or penalty and shall have no other material terms. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Provided that no applicable Law (other than the rules and
regulations of the NYSE, the NYSE Euronext and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,
which shall not apply for purposes of this Section 1.8) shall prohibit the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares
pursuant thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, the
Purchaser may exercise the Top-Up Option after the Top-Up Option has become
exercisable and prior to the Effective Time. The Top-Up Option shall expire
upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

To exercise the Top-Up Option, the Purchaser shall send to the Company a
written notice (a Top-Up Exercise Notice) specifying (i) the number of Top-Up
Option Shares Purchaser wishes to receive, (ii) whether the exercise price
will be paid in the form of a Promissory Note or cash or a combination of the
foregoing, and (iii) the place, time and date for the closing of the purchase
and sale of the Top-Up Option Shares (the Top-Up Closing). The Company shall,
promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice
to the Purchaser confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and
the aggregate purchase price therefor (the Top-Up Notice Receipt). At the
Top-Up Closing, the Purchaser shall pay the Company the 

---|---|--- 
 



10 Shares, including, at the Purchasers option, by delivery of a Promissory Note
in an aggregate principal amount equal to that specified in the Top-Up Notice
Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to the
Purchaser a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares
or, at the Purchasers request or otherwise if the Company does not then have
certificated Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. Such
certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that are required by
applicable Law. 
---|--- 
 



     | (d) | Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge that the Shares which
the Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be
registered under the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an
exemption for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and the
Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that the Purchaser is, and
shall be upon any purchase of Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor",
as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.
The Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Option Shares to
be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall
be acquired by the Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the
meaning of the Securities Act). 
---|---|--- 
 



   2. | CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER 
---|--- 



   2.1 | Conversion of Securities 
---|--- 
 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or the holders of any of the
following securities:



     | (a) | Conversion of Company Common Stock 
---|---|--- 

Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other
than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the
Offer Price (the Merger Consideration), payable net to the holder in cash,
without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable
Law in accordance with Section 2.2(e) and subject, in the case of shares of
Equity Plan Stock, to Section 2.4(b), upon surrender of the Certificate
formerly representing such Shares (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
surrender of such Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with Section 2.2. 



     | (b) | Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock 
---|---|--- 

All Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by
any Company Subsidiary that is directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the
Company, and all Shares owned of record by Parent, the Purchaser or any of
their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect
thereto.

 



     | (c) | The Purchaser Common Stock 
---|---|--- 
 

Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Purchaser issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



11 ---|--- 



     | (a) | Paying Agent 
---|---|--- 

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying agent
for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in
connection with the Merger (the Paying Agent). At or promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent or the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that such
funds on deposit with the Paying Agent are insufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent such additional funds as are necessary to
ensure that the Paying Agent has funds sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration. Such funds shall be invested or otherwise held by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent or Purchaser, in their sole discretion,
pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares.
Earnings from such investments, if any, shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent or Purchaser, and no part of any such earnings shall accrue
to the benefit of holders of Shares.



     | (b) | Procedures for Surrender 
---|---|--- 
 

As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the Certificates) or non-
certificated Shares represented by book-entry (Book-Entry Shares), in each
case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement:



     | (i) | a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or transfer
of the Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the
Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-
Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a
letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates or an "agents message in the case of a book entry transfer of
Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares  

---|---|--- 
 



12 each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest
thereon. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares 
---|---|--- 

All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares
on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement. 



     | (d) | Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability 
---|---|--- 

At any time following the nine month anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b), without interest
and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with Section 2.2(e). If, immediately prior to such time on which
any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied
with the procedures in Section 2.2(b) to receive payment of the Merger
Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment
in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.



     | (e) | Withholding Rights 
---|---|--- 
 

Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the relevant Offer
Price, Merger Consideration or other payment otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options or shares of Equity
Plan Stock, as applicable, such amounts that Parent, the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Law,
including with respect to any stock transfer Taxes payable by a seller. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, Parent shall pay (unless the Paying
Agent is the entity withholding such amounts, in which case, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Paying Agent to pay) such amounts to the
appropriate taxing

 



13  authority and such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options or
shares of Equity Plan Stock, as applicable, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.



     | (f) | Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates 
---|---|--- 

In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) hereof; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



   2.3 | Dissenting Shares 
---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled
to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance
with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such
Shares, the Dissenting Shares) shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as
of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with Section
2.2(e). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and to control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment (unless required by Law) with respect to, or settle or compromise
or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal
of any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. The parties agree
that in any appraisal proceeding with respect to the Dissenting Shares and to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the fair value of the
Dissenting Shares shall be determined in accordance with Section 262(h) of
the DGCL without regard to the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares or any
consideration paid or delivered by the Purchaser to the Company in payment for
the Top-Up Shares, including any Promissory Note. 



   2.4 | Treatment of Options; RSUs; Restricted Stock; Stock Plans 
---|--- 

No later than immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall have
taken all requisite action such that:



     | (a) | Treatment of Company Options 
---|---|--- 

Each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time, shall not be assumed or
substituted for by Parent and, 

 



14  instead, shall be, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and
without any action on the part of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, the
holder of such Company Option or any other Person, cancelled and converted
into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, within 30 days
following the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x)
the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Company Option, and (y) the
excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the per share exercise price under
such Company Option (the Option Payout Amount). If the per share exercise
price under any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the
Offer Price, such Company Option shall be canceled pursuant to this Section
2.4(a) without payment of consideration.



     | (b) | Treatment of Company RSUs, Company Performance RSUs, Company
Restricted Stock 
---|---|--- 
 

The payout of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange
for each Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time remains subject
to the Companys outstanding right to claim the return of such share under the
terms of any Company RSU, Company Performance RSU (each Company RSU and
Company Performance RSU, a share of Equity Plan Stock) and share of Company
Restricted Stock shall remain subject to the vesting terms that applied with
respect to the applicable share of Equity Plan Stock or share of Company
Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Acceptance Time under the equity
plan award agreement pertaining to the applicable share of Equity Plan Stock
or the terms governing the applicable share of Company Restricted Stock. The
Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange
for each share of Equity Plan Stock and each share of Company Restricted
Stock that is unvested at the Effective Time (Unvested Cash) shall not be
payable by the Purchaser at the Effective Time (other than as specifically
provided by the terms of a Contract (other than the Company Stock Option Plan
applicable to each Equity Plan Stock award) to the contrary between the holder
of the applicable share of Equity Plan Stock or the applicable share of
Company Restricted Stock and the Company or a Company Subsidiary that is in
effect on the date of this Agreement) and shall instead be paid by Parent in a
cash lump-sum on the date upon which the applicable share of Equity Plan Stock
or applicable share of Company Restricted Stock would have vested under the
terms and conditions set forth in the award agreement governing the applicable
share of Equity Plan Stock or the terms and conditions governing the
applicable share of Company Restricted Stock (and provided that if such terms
and conditions are not satisfied and vesting ceases to continue at any point
after the Effective Time, no cash payment shall be made with respect to the
applicable share of Equity Plan Stock or applicable share of Company
Restricted Stock). All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) shall
be paid without interest. Following the Effective Time, no Unvested Cash, or
right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred
(including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than
Parent, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any debt or other liability of such Person, prior to the
payment to such Person of such Unvested Cash in accordance with this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, each share
of Equity Plan Stock and each share of Company Restricted Stock held by a non-
employee director of the Company that is outstanding as of the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall not be assumed or substituted for by Parent
and shall instead be cancelled in exchange for a payment by the Surviving
Corporation in respect of each share of Equity Plan Stock or share of Company
Restricted Stock in an amount equal to the Offer Price, to be paid in a cash
lump-sum as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 30 days) following
the Effective Time.



     | (c) | Termination of Company Stock Option Plans 
---|---|--- 
 



15 Following the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, all Company
Stock Option Plans shall be terminated and no further equity awards
(including, but not limited to, any Company Options, Company RSUs or Company
Performance RSUs) or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted
thereunder.

 



   2.5 | Waivers; Board or Committee Resolutions 
---|--- 



     | (a) | To the extent necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated in Section 2.4, the Company shall, prior to the Acceptance Time,
use its reasonable best efforts to provide notice, in a form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, to all holders of outstanding Company Options
and shares of Equity Plan Stock and shares of Company Restricted Stock that
are subject to Section 2.4.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board or any
committee thereof that administers the Company Stock Option Plans shall adopt
resolutions, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, approving the
transactions contemplated in Section 2.4 as valid under the terms of the
Company Stock Option Plans and the award agreements issued thereunder and
further documenting that: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | the transactions contemplated in Section 2.4 are consistent
with the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the award agreements
issued thereunder,  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Parents assumption of the obligation to pay the Merger
Consideration with respect to any Unvested Cash that vests pursuant to the
terms set forth in Section 2.4(b) will result in Parent substituting an
equivalent award for each share of Equity Plan Stock that becomes subject to
the terms set forth in Section 2.4(b), and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | neither consummation of the Offer nor the consummation of
the Merger shall accelerate the vesting of any shares of Equity Plan Stock or
share of Company Restricted Stock that are exchanged for Unvested Cash,
except as specifically provided by (A) Section 2.4(b) with respect to any such
shares held by non-employee directors of the Company or (B) the terms of a
Contract (other than the Company Stock Option Plan applicable to each award
of Equity Plan Stock) to the contrary between the holder of any such shares
and the Company or a Company Subsidiary that is in effect on the date of this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



   2.6 | Company Action; Amendment of Plans 
---|--- 

As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
and Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any
Company Stock Option Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as are required or reasonably requested by Parent to give effect to
the transactions contemplated by Section 2.4 of this Agreement.

 



   3. | REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 
---|--- 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and the Purchaser prior to the execution of this Agreement (the Company
Disclosure Schedule), which identifies items of disclosure by reference to a
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement, as applicable, or any
other part of the Company Disclosure Schedule where it is reasonably apparent
based on the substance of such disclosure (without reference to documents
referred to therein) or the context in which such disclosure is made that such
disclosure shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section

 



16  or subsection of this Agreement, the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and the Purchaser as follows:

 



   3.1 | Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Company and each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or
other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to
the extent a concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, and has all requisite corporate or
organizational, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted in all material respects. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (to the
extent a concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States) in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had a
Company Material Adverse Effect. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | The Company has delivered or caused to be delivered to
Parent and the Purchaser true and complete copies of the Company Certificate
and the Company Bylaws, and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational or governing documents, of each Company Subsidiary.
The Company is not in violation of the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws,
and the Company Subsidiaries are not in violation in any material respect of
their respective organizational or governing documents. None of the Company or
Company Subsidiaries is an "investment company" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a true and complete list of: (A) each Company Subsidiary, together with the
jurisdiction of organization or incorporation, as the case may be, of each
Company Subsidiary and (B) the directors and officers of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary, as of the date of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



   3.2 | Capitalization 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (A)
200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and (B) 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Company Preferred Stock). As
of the close of business on December 1, 2011, there were 84,801,782 shares of

Company shall, during such four-Business Day period, negotiate with Parent in
good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that a Change of Board Recommendation is no longer necessary;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall not have, during such four-Business
Day period, made a written offer that would, upon the Companys acceptance
thereof, be binding on Parent and that, after due consideration of such offer
by the Company Board in good faith and After Consultation, results in the
Company Board determining that it would continue to be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to effect the
Change of Board Recommendation; _provided, further_ , that the Company Board
should not be permitted to effect a Change in Board Recommendation pursuant to
this Section 5.4 with respect to or in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal (which shall be covered by and solely subject, in all respects, to

violation or breach of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4 by any
employee of the Company (other than an officer or a senior executive of the

commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably
requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the

this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking
early termination of any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR
Act. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Purchaser,
directly or indirectly, the right to control, direct or interfere with the
operations of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective

by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable national
securities exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is
subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement

With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (collectively, Parent
Benefit Plans) in which any director, officer or employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary (the Company Employees) will participate effective as
of or after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the 

---|---|--- 
 



54 Company Employees with the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may
be, for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for accrual purposes,
except for vacation and severance, if applicable) in any Parent Benefit Plan

     | (b) | No later than two Business Days prior to its distribution,

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
actions as Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving
Corporation to effect such actions relating to the 401(k) Plan of the Company
(the 401(k) Plan) as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate, including
amending and/or terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Time,
subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and applicable Law and provided that
such action does not preclude the immediate participation of the Company
Employees in any successor plan. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board or the
compensation committee of the Company Board shall take all action necessary to
set the level of the performance payout in connection with the Company
Performance RSUs that were granted in 2011 such that Company Performance RSUs
granted after January 1, 2011 will not vest at a percentage greater than the
percentage or percentages set forth on Section 5.8 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, which shares shall, in all events, continue to be subject to the
time-based vesting restrictions currently applicable to such Company
Performance RSUs under the applicable Equity Plan Stock Awards. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | This Section 5.8 shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
Section 5.8, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Section 5.8. 
---|---|--- 



   5.9 | Indemnification of Directors and Officers. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors,
officers and employees of the Company to the same extent such Persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement
with any directors, officers and employees of the Company arising out of acts
or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the
Company occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in
the defense of any claims, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with
respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section
5.9(a) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company Certificate,
the Company Bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on
the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the director, officer
or employee of the Company to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the
extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advanced expenses to the Surviving
Corporation if it is ultimately determined that such director, officer or
employee is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



55 Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent
organizational or governing documents of each Company Subsidiary, shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers
and employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for periods at or
prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws and the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents of each Company
Subsidiary, as the case may be. The indemnification agreements, if any, in
existence on the date of this Agreement to which the Company or a Company
Subsidiary is a party shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms following the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | For six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain for the benefit of the persons that are insured under the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective
Time (the DandO Insurance) that is substantially equivalent to and in any event
not less favorable in the aggregate than the Companys existing policy (true
and complete copies which have been previously provided to Parent) or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (it being
understood and agreed that in the event such DandO Insurance cannot be obtained
for 300% of such last annual premium or less, in the aggregate, the
Surviving Corporation shall remain obligated to provide the greatest DandO
Insurance coverage as may be obtained for such amount). The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, which
policies provide such persons with coverage for an aggregate period of six
years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder or if such policies are terminated or cancelled,
obtain alternative DandO Insurance on the terms set forth above. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | In the event the Surviving Corporation, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.9, without relieving Parent of its
obligations under this Section 5.9. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | The obligations under this Section 5.9 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material
respect any indemnitee to whom this Section 5.9 applies without the consent
of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to
whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 5.9).  
---|---|--- 
 



56 ---|--- 

If any "control share acquisition", "fair price", "business combination" or
other anti-takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company,
Parent, the Purchaser, the Offer, the Merger or the Top-Up Option, including,
by reason of the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto or any other
transaction contemplated to be consummated by the parties pursuant to this
Agreement, then the Company Board shall take all action necessary to render
such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.



   5.11 | Section 16 Matters 
---|--- 
 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate committee of
non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the

Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
(Section 16) of Shares (including shares of Company Restricted Stock), Company

the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) will take all such steps as
may be required to cause each plan, program, agreement or arrangement entered
into by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof
with any of its officers, directors or employees pursuant to which
consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee to be approved as
an Employment Compensation Arrangement and to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | In the event that, during the period beginning on the date
of this Agreement and ending not less than five Business Days prior to the
Expiration Date, Parent requests that the Compensation Committee of the
Company Board consider whether any plan, program, agreement or arrangement
that Parent would like to enter into, establish, amend or modify pursuant to
which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are
provided, in each case to any Company Employees (each such plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, a Post-Signing Arrangement), would constitute an
Employment Compensation Arrangement and timely provides the Company with such
information with respect to such Post-Signing Arrangement as the Company may
reasonably request, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board will
promptly, and in any event prior to the Expiration Date, consider such Post-
Signing Arrangement at a meeting duly called and held. In the event that,
following such consideration, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board
determines in good faith that such Post-Signing Arrangement constitutes an
Employment Compensation Arrangement, at such meeting the Company Compensation
Committee shall take all such steps as may be necessary to (i) approve as an
Employment Compensation Arrangement such plan, program, agreement or
arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such
Post-Signing Arrangement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The Company agrees that, between the date of this Agreement
and the Acceptance Time, the Company shall cause the Compensation Committee of
the Company Board to be composed solely of Independent Directors. 
---|---|--- 
 



57 ---|--- 

In case at any time at or following the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of the Company and the Purchaser, the
proper officers and directors of the Company and the Purchaser shall take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

interpretation of this Agreement.



   8.7 | Severability 
---|--- 

Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in
any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or
in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making

delete specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

 



   8.8 | Entire Agreement 
---|--- 

This Agreement (together with the Parent Disclosure Schedule and Company
Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES
THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND THE PURCHASER, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY,
ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND
EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION,
MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE BY) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH
RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE
DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING.



   8.9 | Assignment 
---|--- 

The Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by operation of Law or
otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void,
_provided_ that Parent or the Purchaser may assign any of their respective
rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, but no
such assignment shall relieve Parent or the Purchaser, as the case may be, of
its obligations hereunder.

 



76 ---|--- 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, other than pursuant to Section 5.9, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, following the Effective Time, the provisions
of Article 2 relating to the payment of the Merger Consideration shall be
enforceable by holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares.



   8.11 | Mutual Drafting; Interpretation 
---|--- 

Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which
each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the
parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement,
whenever the context requires: the singular number shall include the plural,
and vice versa; the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter
genders; the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders;
and the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. As used
in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and variations
thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Except as otherwise
indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections," "Annexes" and
"Schedules" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Annexes
and Schedules to this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All terms defined in this Agreement have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto, unless
otherwise defined therein. References to a Person are also to its successors
and permitted assigns. All references in this Agreement to "$"refer to U.S.
dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or"
shall not be deemed to be exclusive.

 



   8.12 | Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury 
---|--- 



     | (a) | This Agreement (and any claims or disputes arising out of or
related hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby or to the inducement
of any party to enter herein, whether for breach of contract, tortious
conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or
otherwise) shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, including all matters of
construction, validity and performance, in each case without reference to any
conflict of law rules that might lead to the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court
of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto
(whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether
predicated on common law, statute or otherwise), and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such
action or proceeding (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) except
in Delaware Court of Chancery (and if 

---|---|--- 
 



77 unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action
or proceeding (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise
and whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) may be heard and
determined in Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court
from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding (whether for breach of
contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law,
statute or otherwise) in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction
in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of
the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and
whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) in Delaware Court of
Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding (whether for breach of contract, tortious
conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or
otherwise) shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
within and outside the United States of America by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process anywhere in the world in the manner provided
for notices in Section 8.3. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right
of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH
WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
8.12(c). 
---|---|--- 



   8.13 | Counterparts 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or portable document format (PDF)
and in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

 



78 ---|--- 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages
or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damage.
It is accordingly agreed that prior to any valid termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 7.1, (a) each party shall be entitled at its
election to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity, and this right shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent
and the Purchaser to cause the Offer and the Merger to be consummated and (b)
the parties shall waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense
of adequacy of a remedy at Law. A partys pursuit of specific performance at
any time shall not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to
pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled,
including the right to pursue remedies for Liabilities or damages incurred or
suffered by such party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving
fraud or willful or intentional misconduct.



   8.15 | Guaranty 
---|--- 



     | (a) | To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, SAP AG,
an Aktiengesellschaft organized under the laws of Germany (Guarantor),
intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees to the Company the due and punctual payment and
performance of (i) Parents and the Purchasers obligations under this
Agreement, including with respect to the Offer, and all fees and expenses
associated therewith and (ii) Parents and the Purchasers liability and
obligations (including for breach) under this Agreement (collectively, the
Guaranteed Obligations), in each case, as and when due pursuant to the terms
hereof. This guarantee may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in
full force and effect without interruption and shall be binding on Guarantor
and its successors and assigns until the Guaranteed Obligations have
been satisfied in full. Guarantor further covenants and agrees that, if
requested by the Company, it will promptly appoint in accordance with
applicable Law a registered agent for service of process in the State of
Delaware, and Guarantor shall maintain such registered agent as its agent for
service of process in the State of Delaware without interruption until the
Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | All payments pursuant to this Section 8.15 shall be made in
lawful money of the United States, in immediately available funds. Guarantor
promises and undertakes to make all payments hereunder free and clear of any
deduction, offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of Guarantor of any kind. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The guarantee set forth in Section 8.15(a) (the Guarantee)
is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guarantee of the full and
punctual payment and performance by Parent and the Purchaser of the
Guaranteed Obligations and not of collection. Should Parent or the Purchaser
default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,
Guarantors obligations hereunder shall become immediately due and payable to
the Company or, to the extent that such obligations become due and payable
after the Effective Time, to the stockholders of the Company. Claims hereunder
may be made on one or more occasions. If any payment in respect of any
Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any
reason whatsoever, Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to
such Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been made.  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations shall not be released or
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or
delay on the part of the Company to assert 

---|---|--- 
 



79 Parent or the Purchaser; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or rescission, waiver, compromise,
consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement made in accordance with the terms hereof or any
agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any
of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) the addition, substitution or release of
any Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv)
any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent or
the Purchaser; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other
similar proceeding affecting Parent or the Purchaser or their assets; (vi) the
adequacy of any means the Company may have of obtaining payment related to the
Guaranteed Obligations; or (vii) the existence of any claim, set-off or other
right which Parent or the Purchaser may have at any time against the Company
(other than rights of the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement), whether in
connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Guarantor waives
promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of the Guarantee and of the
Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-
performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of the Guaranteed
Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may
be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar
Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of
assets of Parent or the Purchaser or any other Person interested in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all suretyship defenses
generally (other than, in each case, fraud, willful misconduct and
intentional misrepresentation by the Company or any of its affiliates),
defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that are available to
Parent or the Purchaser under this Agreement and defenses available to
Guarantor under the Guarantee. Guarantor acknowledges that it has received
and will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set forth in
this Section 8.15 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. 
---|--- 



     | (e) | No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power pursuant to this Section 8.15
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
by the Company of any right, remedy or power pursuant to this Section 8.15
preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power pursuant
to this Section 8.15. Each and every right, remedy and power granted to the
Company pursuant to this Section 8.15 or allowed it by Law or agreement with
respect to this Section 8.15 shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
other, and may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time.
The Company shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or in any
manner against, exhaust any or all of the Companys rights against Parent, the
Purchaser or any other Person liable for any Guaranteed Obligations prior to
proceeding against Guarantor hereunder or resort to any security or other
means of collecting payment. The Guarantee may only be amended by a writing
signed and delivered by Guarantor and the Company (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall following the Director Appointment Date require the approval
of a majority of the Continuing Directors). Guarantor hereby covenants and
agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its respective affiliates
not to institute, any proceeding asserting that the Guarantee is illegal,
invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects
of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium
or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally, and general equitable
principles (whether considered a proceeding in equity or at law). 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Company and covenants that:
(i) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of
Guarantors organizational documents or any Law or contractual restriction
binding on Guarantor or its assets; (ii) this Agreement constitutes a legal,  

---|---|--- 
 



80 Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all Laws
relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and subject to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law
or in equity), (iii) nothing in this Agreement will terminate Guarantors
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement and (iv) Guarantor will not
issue any press release or other communication in contravention of Section
5.7. 
---|--- 



     | (g) | Nothing in this Section 8.15 shall waive any defenses,
counterclaims or rights of setoff that Parent or the Purchaser may have under
this Agreement or applicable Law.

Specified Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction against Parent, the

to prohibit or impose limitations on the ability of Parent or the Purchaser,
or otherwise to render Parent or the Purchaser unable, to accept for payment,
pay for or purchase any or all of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, or the

purchased pursuant to the Offer, the Top-Up Option or in the Merger, (C)
seeking to prohibit or impose any limitations on the ownership or

---|---|--- 
 



1 enforced, promulgated or which is deemed applicable pursuant to an
authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a Government Entity to the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, or any other action shall be taken by any Governmental Entity,
other than the application to the Offer or the Merger of applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act or similar waiting periods with respect to
any other Antitrust Laws that (x) has resulted, or is reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to result, directly or indirectly, in any of
the consequences referred to in clauses (A) through (D) of paragraph (i)
above, or (y) has the effect of making the Offer, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement illegal or which has the
effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Offer,
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | (A) any representation or warranty of the Company
contained in Section 3.2 of the Merger Agreement shall fail to be true and
correct in all material respects, as of the Expiration Date with the same
force and effect as if made on and as of such date, except for representations
and warranties that relate to a specific date or time (which need only be true
and correct in all material respects as of such date or time), or (B) any
other representation or warranty of the Company contained in the Merger
Agreement (without giving effect to any references to any Company Material
Adverse Effect or materiality qualifications) shall fail to be true
and correct in any respect as of the Expiration Date with the same force and
effect as if made on and as of such date, except for representations and
warranties that relate to a specific date or time (which need only be true and
correct as of such date or time), except as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate with all
other failures to be true or correct, a Company Material Adverse Effect;
_provided, however_ , if either the total number of Shares as of December 1,
2011 set forth in the first sentence of Section 3.2(a) of the Merger
Agreement, or the total number of Shares subject to outstanding Company
Options as of December 2, 2011 set forth in the first sentence of Section
3.2(b), exceeds such actual numbers as of such date such that if such
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties would cause the aggregate
amount required to be paid by Parent and/or the Purchaser to purchase Shares
pursuant to the Offer to increase by $5 million or more, such representations
and warranties in Sections 3.2(a) and 3.2(b) of the Merger Agreement shall be
deemed to fail to be true and correct in all material respects. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | the Company shall have breached or failed, in any material
respect, to perform or to comply with any agreement or covenant to be
performed or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement and such breach
or failure shall not have been cured; 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | Since the date of the Merger Agreement, a Company Material
Adverse Effect has occurred and is continuing; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) | the Purchaser shall have not received a certificate of the
Company, executed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company, dated as of the Expiration Date, to the effect that
the conditions set forth in paragraphs (d)(iii), (d)(iv) and (d)(v) of this
Annex 1 have not occurred. 
---|---|--- 

The foregoing conditions (including those set forth in clauses (a), (b) and
(c) of the initial paragraph) are for the sole benefit of Parent and the
Purchaser and may be asserted by Parent or the Purchaser regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent
or the Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
their sole discretion (except that the Minimum Condition may not be waived),
in each case subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Any reference in
this Annex 1 or the Merger Agreement to a condition or requirement being
satisfied

 



2  shall be deemed to be satisfied if such condition or requirement is so
waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation
of, the rights of Parent and the Purchaser to extend, terminate, amend and/or
modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
The failure by Parent or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time. In addition, each of the foregoing conditions is
independent of any of the other foregoing conditions; the exclusion of any
event from a particular condition does not mean that such event may not be
included in another condition.

The capitalized terms used in this Annex 1 and not defined in this Annex 1
shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
Merger Agreement), dated as of December 3, 2011, by and among SAP America,
Inc., Saturn Expansion Corporation, SuccessFactors, Inc.
