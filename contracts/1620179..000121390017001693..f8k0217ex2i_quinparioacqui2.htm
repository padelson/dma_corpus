Article II 
  
 PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE; EFFECT OF MERGERS ON CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

(a)  At the SourceHOV Effective Time, by virtue of the
SourceHOV Merger and without any action on the part of SourceHOV, Parent or
any Subsidiary, SourceHOV Merger Sub or the holders of any SourceHOV Common
Stock (as defined herein) or SourceHOV Merger Sub Common Stock (as defined

(i)   _Conversion of SourceHOV Merger Sub Common Stock_. The
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in SourceHOV Merger Sub
(the " _SourceHOV Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the SourceHOV Effective Time shall be converted into
100% of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share of the SourceHOV Surviving Company with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the SourceHOV Surviving Company. From
and after the SourceHOV Effective Time, any and all certificates representing
shares of SourceHOV Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the SourceHOV Surviving
Company into which such number of shares were converted into ratably in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii)   _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_.
All shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, in SourceHOV (the "
_SourceHOV Common Stock_ ") that are owned by SourceHOV as treasury stock and
each share of SourceHOV Common Stock that is owned by Parent or SourceHOV
Merger Sub immediately prior to the SourceHOV Effective Time shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(iii)   _Conversion of SourceHOV Common Stock_. Each share of
SourceHOV Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
SourceHOV Effective Time (excluding SourceHOV Dissenting Shares and shares to
be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ ) shall be converted into
the right to receive the SourceHOV Merger Consideration. The SourceHOV Common
Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
SourceHOV Common Stock immediately prior to the SourceHOV Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the SourceHOV Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon
the delivery of a Letter of Transmittal (including all certificates
representing shares of SourceHOV Common Stock), without interest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and the
SourceHOV Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or
SourceHOV Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any equity dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation or
exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number
or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock or SourceHOV Common Stock, as the case may be, will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of SourceHOV
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior

(b)  At the Novitex Effective Time, by virtue of the Novitex
Merger and without any action on the part of Novitex, Parent or any
Subsidiary, Novitex Merger Sub or the holders of any Novitex Common Stock (as
defined herein) or Novitex Merger Sub Common Stock (as defined herein):

  



  

(i)   _Conversion of Novitex Merger Sub Common Stock_. The
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in Novitex Merger Sub (the
" _Novitex Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Novitex Effective Time shall be converted into 100% of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share
of the Novitex Surviving Company with the same rights, powers and privileges
as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Novitex Surviving Company. From and after the Novitex
Effective Time, any and all certificates representing shares of Novitex
Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of shares of common stock of the Novitex Surviving Company into which
such number of shares were converted into ratably in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(ii)   _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_.
All shares of Novitex Common Stock that are owned by Novitex as treasury
stock and each share of Novitex Common Stock that is owned by Parent or
Novitex Merger Sub immediately prior to the Novitex Effective Time shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(iii)   _Conversion of Novitex Common Stock_. Each share of
Novitex Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Novitex
Effective Time (excluding shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section
2.1(b)(ii)_ ) shall be converted into the right to receive the Novitex Merger
Consideration. The Novitex Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Novitex Common Stock immediately prior to the Novitex
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Novitex Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor (including all certificates representing shares of Novitex Common
Stock), without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the
date of this Agreement and the Novitex Effective Time, the outstanding shares
of Parent Common Stock or Novitex Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any equity
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall
have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or Novitex Common Stock, as the
case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the
holders of Novitex Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
sentence shall not be construed to permit Parent or Novitex to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

in favor of the SourceHOV Merger or consented thereto in writing and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _SourceHOV Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive consideration set forth in _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_ above, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect,
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder\'s right to
appraisal under the DGCL. The holders of SourceHOV Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such SourceHOV Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. If any
such holder fails to perfect such appraisal right in accordance with the DGCL
or withdraws or otherwise loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share
of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only
for the right to receive from the SourceHOV Surviving Company, as of the
later of the SourceHOV Effective Time and the time that such right to
appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the SourceHOV
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. At the
SourceHOV Effective Time, any holder of SourceHOV Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisals or compromise, offer to settle or
settle, or otherwise make any binding agreement regarding, any such demands.

entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to this _Section
2.2(b)_ (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_

representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash

Persons may have against any Former Stockholder Indemnitors and (iii) to the
extent permitted by Law, it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the
Former Stockholder Indemnitors from any and all claims for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Each of

Indemnified Persons have sought indemnification pursuant hereto shall affect
the foregoing and such Former Stockholder Indemnitors shall have a right of
contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or
payment to all of the rights of recovery of the DandO Indemnified Persons
against the SourceHOV Surviving Company, the Novitex Surviving Company and
Parent.

be obligated to pay annual premiums greater than 300% of such premiums paid

such coverage and amount of insurance would exceed 300% of such current

SourceHOV Surviving Company and the Novitex Surviving Company to, and the

to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent, SourceHOV Surviving Company or
the Novitex Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations of Parent, SourceHOV Surviving Company or the Novitex Surviving
Company, as applicable, set forth in this _Section 7.10_.

shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain waivers from each
Person who has a right to any payments and/or benefits as a result of or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would

of Section 280G of the Code and as to which such Person waives his or her
rights to some or all of such payments and/or benefits (the " _Waived

applicable, solicit the approval of the stockholders of Novitex to the extent
required under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code of any Waived 280G Benefits

of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Prior to the Closing Date, Novitex

provisions of this _Section 7.12_ and that either (A) the requisite number
of votes were obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the " _280G
Approval_ ") and, as a consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits shall be made or
provided, or (B) that the 280G Approval was not obtained and, as a
consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided.
Novitex shall provide Parent, SourceHOV and each of their respective
representatives, with a copy of such waiver and disclosure statement at least

hereof and no later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing,

documentation required to determine whether the vote described in this
_Section 7.12_ is necessary in order to avoid the imposition of Taxes under
Section 4999 of the Code.

shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by Law, in

solicit the Parent Stockholder Approvals. Parent shall, through the board of
directors of Parent, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Parent
Stockholder Approvals and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy

7.16(e)_, if on a date for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled,
Parent has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approvals, whether
or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have the right to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Parent Stockholders Meeting,
provided that (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by

   | 10.3| Severability 
---|---|--- 
  

It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this
Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and
public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement shall be
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall
be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more
narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such
jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn,
without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting
the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New

with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts,
(c) agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered

laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such action in any such court and (e) agrees that a final
judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in

2(c)_.

  



  

" _Well-Known Seasoned Issuer_ " means a " _well-known seasoned issuer_ " as
defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act and which (i) is a "
_well-known seasoned issuer_ " under paragraph (1)(i)(A) of such
definition or (ii) is a " _well-known seasoned issuer_ " under paragraph
(1)(i)(B) of such definition and is also eligible to register a primary
offering of its securities relying on General Instruction I.B.1 of Form S-3 or
Form F-3 under the Securities Act.

  



  

2. Shelf Registrations.

  



  

(a) _Filing_. The Company shall file as promptly as practicable, and
in no event later than 45 days after the Effective Date, a
Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration on Form S-3 (the " _Form S-3
Shelf_ ") or, if the Company is ineligible to use a Form S-3 Shelf, a
Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration on Form S-1 (the " _Form S-1
Shelf,_ " and together with the Form S-3 Shelf (and any Subsequent Shelf
Registration), the " _Shelf_ ") covering the resale of the Registrable
Securities on a delayed or continuous basis. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Shelf to become effective as soon as practicable
after such filing. The Shelf shall provide for the resale of
Registrable Securities from time to time, and pursuant to any method or
combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, the Holders.
The Company shall maintain the Shelf in accordance with the terms hereof, and
shall prepare and file with the Commission such amendments, including post-
effective amendments, and supplements as may be necessary to keep such Shelf
effective and in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act until
such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities. In the event the
Company files a Form S-1 Shelf, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to convert the Form S-1 Shelf (and any Subsequent Shelf Registration)
to a Form S-3 Shelf as soon as practicable after the Company is eligible to
use Form S-3.

  



  

(b) _Subsequent Shelf Registration_. If any Shelf ceases to be
effective under the Securities Act for any reason at any time while
Registrable Securities are still outstanding, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as is reasonably
practicable cause such Shelf to again become effective under the Securities
Act (including obtaining the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness of such Shelf), and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to as promptly as is reasonably practicable amend such Shelf in a
manner reasonably expected to result in the withdrawal of any order suspending
the effectiveness of such Shelf or file an additional registration statement
as a Shelf Registration (a " _ _Subsequent Shelf Registration__
") registering the resale from time to time by the Holders thereof of all
securities that are Registrable Securities as of the time of such filing. If
a Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause such Subsequent Shelf
Registration to become effective under the Securities Act as promptly as is
reasonably practicable after the filing thereof (it being agreed that the
Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement if the Company is a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer) and (ii) keep such
Subsequent Shelf Registration continuously effective and usable until there
are no longer any Registrable Securities. Any such Subsequent Shelf
Registration shall be on Form S-3 to the extent that the Company is eligible
to use such form. Otherwise, such Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be on
another appropriate form and shall provide for the registration of such
Registrable Securities for resale by the Holders in accordance with any
reasonable method of distribution elected by the Demand Holders and the QPAC
Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to
file a Subsequent Shelf Registration if (i) the aggregate amount of
Registrable Securities represents less than 5% of the then outstanding Common
Stock and (ii) the Company is ineligible to use a Form S-3 Shelf; _provided
that the Company shall be required to file_ a Subsequent Shelf Registration
if it thereafter becomes eligible to use a Form S-3 Shelf.

(c) _Requests for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns_. At any time and from
time to time after the Shelf has been declared effective by the
Commission, any Apollo Demand Holder or HGM Demand Holder may request to sell
all or any portion of their Registrable Securities in an
underwritten offering that is registered pursuant to the Shelf (each, an "
_Underwritten Shelf Takedown_ ").

  



  

(d) _Demand Notices_. All requests for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns
shall be made by giving written notice to the Company (the " _Demand Shelf
Takedown Notice_ "). Each Demand Shelf Takedown Notice shall specify the
approximate number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in the
Underwritten Shelf Takedown and the expected price range (net of underwriting
discounts and commissions) of such Underwritten Shelf Takedown. Within three
days after receipt of any Demand Shelf Takedown Notice, the Company shall
give written notice of such requested Underwritten Shelf Takedown to all
other Holders of Registrable Securities (the " _Company Shelf Takedown
Notice_ ") and, subject to the provisions of _Section_ 5 below, shall include
in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown all Registrable Securities with respect
to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion
therein within ten days after sending the Company Shelf Takedown Notice.

  



  

(e) _Selection of Underwriters_. Apollo and the HGM Group, acting
together, shall have the right to select the investment banker(s) and
manager(s) to administer the offering (which shall consist of one or more
reputable nationally recognized investment banks), subject to the Company's
prior approval which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  



  

(f) _Other Registration Rights_. The Company represents and warrants
that it is not a party to, or otherwise subject to, any other agreement
granting registration rights to any other Person with respect to any
securities of the Company, including securities convertible, exercisable or
exchangeable into or for shares of any equity securities of the Company,
except for (i) the provisions of Section 7.16(h) of the Business Combination
Agreement, (ii) that certain Warrant Agreement, dated January 15, 2015,
between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, providing
for the registration of the resale of an aggregate of 17,500,000 shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of an aggregate of 35,000,000
warrants to purchase Common Stock, each warrant entitling the holder thereof
to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock and (iii) that certain
Registration Rights Agreement, dated [ ], 2017, by and between the
Company and [ ]. Without the prior written consent of Apollo and the HGM
Group, the Company will not grant to any holder or prospective holder of any
securities of the Company registration rights with respect to such securities
which are senior to or otherwise conflict in any material respect with the
rights granted pursuant to this Agreement.

3. Demand Registrations.

  



  

(a) _Requests for Registration_. At any time after the Effective Date,
any Demand Holder (in such capacity, the " _Requesting Holder_ ") may request
(i) registration under the Securities Act of all or any portion of the
Registrable Securities held by such Requesting Holder on Form S-3 or any
similar short-form registration (a " _Short-Form Registration_ "), if
available, and (ii) registration under the Securities Act of all or any
portion of the Registrable Securities held by such Requesting Holder on Form
S-1 or similar long-form registration (a " _Long-Form Registration_ ") if
Short-Form Registration is not available (any registration under this
_Section 3(a)_ , a " _Demand Registration_ "); _provided _ that, in the case
of a Demand Registration, such Demand Holder will be entitled to make such
demand only if the total offering price of the Registrable Securities to be
sold in such offering (including piggyback shares and before deduction of
underwriting discounts) is reasonably expected to exceed, in the aggregate,
$25,000,000. Any Requesting Holder may request that any offering conducted
under a Long-Form Registration or a Short-Form Registration be underwritten.

  



  

(b) _Demand Registration Notices_. All requests for Demand
Registrations shall be made by giving written notice to the Company (the "
_Demand Registration Notice_ "). Each Demand Registration Notice shall
specify (i) whether such Demand Registration shall be an underwritten
offering, (ii) the approximate number of Registrable Securities proposed to be
sold in the Demand Registration and (iii) the expected price range (net of
underwriting discounts and commissions) of such Demand Registration. Within
five days after receipt of any Demand Registration Notice, the Company shall
give written notice of such requested Demand Registration to all other
Holders of Registrable Securities (the " _Company Demand Registration Notice_
") and, subject to the provisions of _Section_ 5 below, shall include in such
Demand Registration all Registrable Securities with respect to which the
Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within 10 days
after sending the Company Demand Registration Notice.

  



  

(c) _Demand Registration Effectiveness_. A registration shall not
count as one of the permitted Demand Registrations until both (i) it has
become effective (unless such Demand Registration has not become effective due
solely to the fault of the Demand Holder requesting such registration) and
(ii) the Demand Holder initially requesting such registration is able to
register and sell pursuant to such registration at least 80% of the
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration either at
the time of the registration or within 90 days thereafter; _provided_ that a
Demand Registration which is withdrawn at the sole request of the Demand
Holder who demanded such Demand Registration will count as a Demand
Registration unless the Company is reimbursed by such Demand Holder for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company in connection with
such registration, including reasonable attorney and accounting fees.

  



  

   

 | Ex B-8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Short-Form Registrations_. Demand Registrations shall be Short-
Form Registrations whenever the Company is permitted to use an
applicable short form. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make Short-Form Registrations on Form S-3 (or any successor form) available
for the sale of Registrable Securities.

  



  

(e) _Restrictions on Demand Registrations_.

  



  

(i) The Company shall not be obligated to effect (a) any Long-Form
Registration within 90 days or (b) any Short-Form Registration within 45
days, in each case, after the effective date of a previous Demand Registration
or a previous registration in which the Holders of Registrable Securities
were given piggyback rights pursuant to _Section_ 4 of this Agreement and in
which such Holders were able to register and sell at least 80% of the number
of Registrable Securities requested to be included therein. In addition, the
Company shall not be obligated to effect any Demand Registration during the
period starting with the date that is 60 days prior to the Board's good faith
estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on the date that is 120 days
(unless the underwriting agreement requires a longer period of time) after
the effective date of, a Company initiated registration statement,
_provided _ that the Company is actively employing in good faith all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration to
become effective, and _provided further_ that the aggregate number of days
that any one or more Demand Registrations are suspended or delayed by
operation of this _Section 3(e)(i)_ shall not exceed 120 days in any 12-month
period. In the event of any such suspension or delay, the Holder of
Registrable Securities initially requesting a Demand Registration that is
suspended by operation of this _Section 3(e)(i)_ shall be entitled to
withdraw such request and, if such request is withdrawn, such Demand
Registration shall not count as one of the permitted Demand Registrations
hereunder, and, notwithstanding the proviso in _Section 3(c)_ , the Company
shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with such registration.

  



  

(ii) The Apollo Demand Holders and the HGM Demand Holders shall each be
entitled to request up to five Demand Registrations.

  



  

(f) _Selection of Underwriters_. The Holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities requested to be included in a Demand
Registration which is an underwritten offering shall have the right to select
the investment banker(s) and manager(s) to administer the offering (which
shall consist of one or more reputable nationally recognized investment
banks), subject to the approval of the Company, the Apollo Demand Holders and
the HGM Demand Holders, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

  



  

(g) _Transfer of Demand Rights_. The rights of a Holder under this
_Section 3_ may be transferred, assigned or otherwise conveyed in whole or in
part, to any transferee or assignee (other than a transfer pursuant to a
registration statement or under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities
Act) who, following such transfer, assignment or conveyance, holds at least
[20]% of the outstanding Common Stock held by such Holder as of the Effective
Date, _provided_ that the requirements of _Section 14_ are satisfied. For the
avoidance of doubt, any transferee of an Apollo Demand Holder or HGM Demand
Holder shall be deemed to be an Apollo Demand Holder or HGM Demand Holder, as
applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement. In the case of any such
assignment, the applicable Demand Holder shall inform the Company how many
remaining Demand Registrations the transferee shall have, which shall not
exceed the maximum number set forth in _Section 3(e)(ii)_.

4. Piggyback Takedowns.

  



  

(a) _Right to Piggyback_. Whenever the Company proposes to register
any of its securities (whether or not following a request by a
Demand Holder), including a registration pursuant to any registration rights
agreement not prohibited by this agreement (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "),
or proposes to offer any Common Stock pursuant to a registration statement in
an underwritten offering of Common Stock under the Securities Act (whether or
not following a request by a Demand Holder) (together with a Piggyback
Registration, a " _Piggyback Takedown_ "), the Company shall give prompt
written notice to all Holders of Registrable Securities of its intention to
effect such Piggyback Takedown. In the case of a Piggyback Takedown that is an
underwritten offering under a shelf registration statement, such notice shall
be given not less than ten Business Days prior to the expected date
of commencement of marketing efforts for such Piggyback Takedown. In the case
of a Piggyback Takedown that is an underwritten offering under a registration
statement that is not a shelf registration statement, such notice shall be
given not less than ten Business Days prior to the expected date of filing of
such registration statement. The Company shall, subject to the provisions of
_Section _ 5 below, include in such Piggyback Takedown, as applicable, all
Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received written
requests for inclusion therein within five Business Days after sending the
Company's notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
(i) the Company may determine not to proceed with any Piggyback Takedown upon
written notice to the Holders of Registrable Securities requesting to include
their Registrable Securities in such Piggyback Takedown;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this clause (i) shall impair the right of any
Demand Holder to request that such registration be effected pursuant to
_Section 2_ or _Section 3_; and (ii) any Holder of Registrable
Securities may withdraw its request for inclusion by giving written notice to
the Company of its intention to withdraw that registration;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the withdrawal shall be irrevocable and after making the
withdrawal, a Holder shall no longer have any right to include its
Registrable Securities in that Piggyback Takedown.

  



  

(b) _Selection of Underwriters_. If any Piggyback Takedown is an
underwritten offering, the Company will have the sole right to select
the investment banker(s) and manager(s), acceptable to the Apollo Demand
Holder and the HGM Demand Holders, for the offering.

  



  

5. Priority.

  



  

(a) _Priority on Primary Offerings and Offerings Initiated by Holders
of Other Registration Rights_. If the Company determines, after
consultation with the Apollo Demand Holders, the HGM Demand Holders and the
managing underwriter in any underwritten Piggyback Takedown that was not
initiated by a Demand Holder pursuant to this Agreement, that less than all of
the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such underwritten
offering can be sold in an orderly manner within a price range acceptable to
the Company or the holders of the Company's securities demanding such
Piggyback Takedown pursuant to a registration rights agreement not
prohibited by this agreement, as applicable, after consultation with the
Apollo Demand Holders and the HGM Demand Holders, then the Company shall
include in such underwritten Piggyback Registration the number which can be so
sold in the following order of priority:

  



  

(i) _first_ , the securities the Company proposes to sell;

  



  

   

 | Ex B-10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) _second_ , the Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such Piggyback Registration by the Apollo Demand Holders, the HGM
Demand Holders, the QPAC Holders, the Third Party Holders and the holders
entitled to participate in such Piggyback Takedown pursuant to a registration
rights agreement not prohibited by this agreement, _pro rata_ on the basis of
the number of shares of Common Stock owned by such Holders; and

  



  

(iii) _third_ , other securities requested to be included in such
underwritten Piggyback Takedown.

  



  

(b) _Priority on Offerings Initiated by Demand Holders_. If the
Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities requested to be
included in any underwritten offering initiated by a Demand Holder pursuant
to this Agreement determine, after consultation with the Company and the
managing underwriter in such offering, that less than all of the Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such underwritten offering can be sold
in an orderly manner within a price range acceptable to such Holders, then the
Company shall include in such underwritten offering the number which can be
so sold in the following order of priority:

  



  

(i) _first_ , the Registrable Securities requested to be included in
accordance with this Agreement by the Apollo Demand Holders, the HGM
Demand Holders, the QPAC Holders, the Third Party Holders and the holders
entitled to participate in such Piggyback Takedown pursuant to a registration
rights agreement not prohibited by this agreement, _pro rata_ on the basis of
the number of shares of Common Stock owned by such Holders;

  



  

(ii) _second_ , the securities the Company proposes to sell; and

  



  

(iii) _third_ , other securities requested to be included in such
underwritten offering.

  



  

6. Suspension Period.

  



  

(a) _Suspension Period_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if the Board determines in good faith that the
registration and distribution of Registrable Securities (i) would reasonably
be expected to materially impede, delay or interfere with, or require
premature disclosure of, any material financing, offering, acquisition,
merger, corporate reorganization, segment reclassification or discontinuance
of operations that is required to be reflected in pro forma or restated
financial statements that amends historical financial statement of the
Company, or other significant transaction or any negotiations, discussions or
pending proposals with respect thereto, involving the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or (ii) would require disclosure of non-public material
information, the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the Company, the Company shall be entitled to
suspend, for not more than 60 days (a " _Suspension Period_ "), the use of any
Registration Statement or Prospectus and shall not be required to amend or
supplement the Registration Statement, any related Prospectus or any
document incorporated therein by reference. The Company promptly will give
written notice of any such Suspension Period to each Person that has
securities registered on a Registration Statement filed hereunder.

  



  

   

 | Ex B-11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Limitations on Suspension Periods._ Notwithstanding anything
contained in this _Section 6_ to the contrary, the Company shall not be
entitled to more than two Suspension Periods in any 12-month period.

  



  

7. Holdback Agreements.

  



  

(a) During the period commencing on the Effective Date and continuing
until the calendar date that is six months following the Effective Date (or
until the calendar date that is twelve months following the Effective Date, in
the case of any shares of Common Stock held by the QPAC Holders, the QPAC
Founders and Game Boy, other than those shares subject to the last
sentence of this _Section 7(a)_ , except in the event that the underwriters
that managed the Company's initial public offering agree to a shorter period
by written consent; provided that no such shorter period shall expire before
the period that applies to other Holders pursuant to this sentence), no
Holder shall offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to
purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of or distribute ("
_Transfer_ ") any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into,
exercisable for, exchangeable for Common Stock, whether now owned or
hereinafter acquired, owned directly by the Holder (including securities held
as a custodian) or with respect to which the Holder has beneficial ownership
within the rules and regulations of the Commission (collectively, the "
_Restricted Shares_ "), except in the event the underwriters managing any
Shelf Takedown or other underwritten public equity offering by the Company
otherwise agree by written consent or pursuant to a Transfer permitted by
_Section 7(c)_. The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude
each Holder from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which
is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in
a sale or disposition of the Restricted Shares even if such Restricted Shares
would be disposed of by someone other than such Holder. Such prohibited
hedging or other transactions include any short sale or any purchase, sale or
grant of any right (including any put or call option) with respect to any of
the Restricted Shares of the applicable Holder or with respect to any security
that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from
such Restricted Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary,
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7(a)_ shall not apply to (i) an
aggregate of 20% of the number of Retained Shares, as defined in the
Forfeiture Agreement, held by the QPAC Holders, the QPAC Founders and Game
Boy, as designated by the QPAC Holders pursuant to the Forfeiture Agreement,
which may be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise disposed of as of the
Effective Date (the " _Founder Shares_ ") or (ii) any person who ceases to be
employed by Novitex after the date of the Business Combination Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Holders of Registrable Securities_. In connection with any Shelf
Takedown or other underwritten public offering of equity securities by the
Company, subject to _Section 7(c)_, no Holder of more than 5% of the equity
securities of the Company, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for such securities, shall Transfer any Registrable Securities
(other than those Registrable Securities included in such registration
pursuant to this Agreement), without the prior written consent of the
Company, during the seven days prior to and the 90-day period beginning on the
date of pricing of such Shelf Takedown or other underwritten public offering
(the " _Lock-Up Period_ "), except in the event the underwriters managing the
Shelf Takedown or other underwritten public equity offering by the Company
otherwise agree by written consent or pursuant to a Transfer permitted by
_Section 7(c)_. Each such Holder agrees to execute a lock-up agreement in
favor of the Company's underwriters to such effect (in each case on
substantially the same terms and conditions as all such Holders) and, in any
event, that the Company's underwriters in any relevant Shelf Takedown or
other underwritten public offering shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 7(b)_ ; _provided_ that each such Holder shall only be required to
execute such lock-up if the directors and executive officers of the Company
have executed a lock-up on terms at least as restrictive with respect to the
relevant Shelf Takedown or other underwritten public offering. The provisions
of this _Section 7(b)_ will no longer apply to a Holder once such Holder
ceases to hold Registrable Securities or 5% or less of the equity securities
of the Company.

  



  

   

 | Ex B-12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Permitted Transfers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Section 7, a Holder may Transfer Restricted Shares (i) as a
_bona fide_ gift; (ii) to any trust or entity wholly owned by one or more
trusts for the direct or indirect benefit of (A) the Holder or its
stockholders, partners, members or beneficiaries or (B) of any individual
related to such Holder or to the stockholders, partners, members or
beneficiaries of such Holder, by blood, marriage or adoption and not more
remote than first cousin; (iii) if a Holder is a corporation, limited
liability company, partnership or trust, such Holder may Transfer
Restricted Shares to any wholly-owned subsidiary thereof, or to the
Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members or beneficiaries of such Holder;
(iv) pursuant to any take-over bid, acquisition, sale or merger involving the
Company; or (v) with the prior written consent of the Company and each other
Holder; provided that in each case such distributees or transferees agree to
be bound by the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7._

  



  

(d) _The Company_. In connection with any Shelf Takedown, the Company
shall not effect any public sale or distribution of its equity securities, or
any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such
securities (except pursuant to registrations on Form S-8 or Form S-4 under
the Securities Act), during the seven days prior to and the 90-day period
beginning on the date of pricing of such Shelf Takedown or such other period
provided in the underwriting, placement or similar agreement executed
in connection with such Shelf Takedown.

  



  

8. Company Undertakings.

(b) notify each Holder of Registrable Securities of the effectiveness
of each Registration Statement and prepare and file with the Commission such
amendments and supplements to such Registration Statement and the Prospectus
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement effective for a period ending on the date on which all Registrable
Securities have been sold under such Registration Statement or have otherwise
ceased to be Registrable Securities, and comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered
by such Registration Statement during such period in accordance with the
intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such
Registration Statement;

  



  

(c) furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities, and the managing
underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of the
applicable Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the
Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including each
preliminary Prospectus, final Prospectus, and any other Prospectus (including
any Prospectus filed under Rule 424, Rule 430A or Rule 430B promulgated under
the Securities Act and any " _issuer free writing prospectus_ " as such term
is defined under Rule 433 promulgated under the Securities Act)), all
exhibits and other documents filed therewith and such other documents as such
seller or such managing underwriters may reasonably request including in order

Statement remains in effect, and (iii) to do any and all other acts and things
which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such seller to
consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable
Securities owned by such seller ( _provided_ that the Company shall not be
required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it
would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this subsection, (B)
subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (C) consent to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction);

  



  

(e) notify each seller of such Registrable Securities, Counsel to the
Holders and the managing underwriters: (i) at any time when a
Prospectus relating to the applicable Registration Statement is required to
be delivered under the Securities Act, (A) upon discovery that, or upon the
happening of any event as a result of which, such Registration Statement, or
the Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus relating to such Registration
Statement, or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein
by reference contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any
fact necessary to make the statements in the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus relating thereto not misleading or
otherwise requires the making of any changes in such Registration Statement,
Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or document, and, at the request of any
such seller and subject to  _Section 6(a)_ hereof, the Company shall
promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus or Free
Writing Prospectus, furnish a reasonable number of copies of such supplement
or amendment to each seller of such Registrable Securities, Counsel to the
Holders and the managing underwriters and file such supplement or amendment

fact or omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, (B) as soon as the Company becomes aware of any comments or
inquiries by the Commission or any requests by the Commission or any Federal
or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a
Registration Statement or related Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus
covering Registrable Securities or for additional information relating
thereto, (C) as soon as the Company becomes aware of the issuance or
threatened issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending or
threatening to suspend the effectiveness of a Registration Statement covering
the Registrable Securities or (D) of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption
from qualification of any Registrable Security for sale in any jurisdiction,
or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; (ii) when
each Registration Statement or any amendment thereto has been filed with the
Commission and when each Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or any post effective
amendment thereto has become effective; and (iii) if at any time the Company
has reason to believe that the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in any agreement contemplated by _Section 8(h)_ below relating to
any applicable offering cease to be true and correct.

Holders of such Registrable Securities _pro rata on the basis of the number

10. Indemnification; Contribution.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless each Holder of Registrable Securities, the Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, members, managers and agents of each such
Holder and each Person who controls any such Holder within the meaning of
either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, from and against any losses, claims, expenses, damages and
liabilities or whatever kind (including legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending same and
the cost of enforcing any right to indemnification hereunder) (collectively,
" _Losses_ ") to which they or any of them may become subject insofar as such
Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
a Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or
the Disclosure Package, or any preliminary, final or summary Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus included in any such Registration Statement, or in any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
or (ii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any other federal law, any state or foreign securities
law, or any rule or regulation promulgated under of the foregoing laws,
relating to the offer or sale of the Registrable Securities, and in any such
case, the Company agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as
incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such Loss, claim,
damage, liability, action or investigation (whether or not the indemnified
party is a party to any proceeding); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company will not be liable in any case to the extent that any such Loss arises
out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information relating to such Holder furnished to the
Company by or on behalf of any such Holder specifically for inclusion
therein, including any notice and questionnaire. This indemnity agreement
will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

  



  

   

 | Ex B-19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Indemnification by the Holders_. Each Holder severally (and not
jointly) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of
its Affiliates, directors, employees, members, managers and agents and each
Person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
from and against any and all Losses to which they or any of them may become
subject insofar as such Losses arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a
Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in
the Disclosure Package or any Holder Free Writing Prospectus, preliminary,
final or summary Prospectus included in any such Registration Statement, or
in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based
upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is
contained in any written information relating to such Holder furnished to the
Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the total amount to be indemnified by such
Holder pursuant to this  _Section 10(b)_ shall be limited to the net
proceeds (after deducting underwriters' discounts and commissions) received
by such Holder in the offering to which such Registration Statement or
Prospectus relates; _provided_ , _further_ , that a Holder shall not be
liable in any case to the extent that prior to the filing of any such
Registration Statement or Disclosure Package, or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, such Holder has furnished in writing to the Company,
information expressly for use in, and within a reasonable period of time
prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or Disclosure
Package, or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto which corrected or
made not misleading information previously provided to the Company. This
indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any such Holder
may otherwise have.

  



  

(c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Promptly after receipt
by an indemnified party under this _Section 10_ of notice of the
commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this _Section
10_, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but
the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve the
indemnifying party from liability under _Section 10(a)_ or _Section 10(b)_
above unless and to the extent such action and such failure results in
material prejudice to the indemnifying party and forfeiture by the
indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in
any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any
indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in
_Section 10(a)_ or _Section 10(b)_ above. The indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish,
jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who
shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to
the indemnifying party), and, except as provided in the next sentence, after
notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election
to so assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable
to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection
with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's rights in the prior sentence, the
indemnified party shall have the right to employ one firm of separate counsel
(and one local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the
reasonable, documented fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if:

  



  

(i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent
the indemnified party would present such counsel with an actual or potential
conflict of interest;

  



  

   

 | Ex B-20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such
action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party;

  



  

(iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel
satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party
within 10 days after notice of the institution of such action or such earlier
time as may be necessary to pursue appropriate defenses, rights, and
remedies; or

  



  

(iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to
employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.

  



  

No indemnifying party shall, in connection with any one action or separate
but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising
out of the same general circumstances or allegations, be liable for the fees
and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any
local counsel) for all indemnified parties. An indemnifying party shall not
be liable under this _Section 10_ to any indemnified party regarding any
settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of
which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not
the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or
action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by such
indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No
indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall,
except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise that (x) does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff therein, to such indemnified party, of a full and final release
from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation or (y) includes a
statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act
by or on behalf of such indemnified party.

  



  

(d) _Contribution_.

  



  

(i) In the event that the indemnity provided in _Section 10(a)_ or
_Section 10(b)_ above is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party
agrees to contribute to the aggregate Losses to which such indemnifying party
may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and by the
indemnified party on the other from the offering of the Common Stock.
If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is
not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but
also the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the
indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
which resulted in such Losses (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying
party on the one hand or the indemnified party on the other and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission.

  



  

   

 | Ex B-21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section 10(d)_ were determined by _pro rata_
allocation (even if the Holders of Registrable Securities or any agents or
underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or
by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this _Section 10(d)_. The amount paid or
payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses (or actions in
respect thereof) referred to above in this _Section 10(d)_ shall be deemed to
include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such
action or claim.

  



  

(iii) For purposes of this _Section 10_, each Person who controls any
Holder of Registrable Securities, agent or underwriter within the meaning of
either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer,
employee and agent of any such Holder, agent or underwriter shall have the
same rights to contribution as such Holder, agent or underwriter, and each
Person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Company
shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each
case to the applicable terms and conditions of this _Section 10(d)_.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 10_ will remain in full force and
effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder of
Registrable Securities or the Company or any of the officers, directors or
controlling Persons referred to in this _Section 10_ hereof, and will
survive the transfer of Registrable Securities.

  



  

(f) To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is
prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the
maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise
be liable under _Section 10_ to the fullest extent permitted by law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) no Person involved in the sale of
Registrable Securities which Person is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) in
connection with such sale shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
involved in such sale of Registrable Securities who was not guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation; and (ii) contribution by any seller of
Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of
proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Shelf Registration.

  



  

11. Participation in Underwritten Offering/Sale of Registrable Securities.

  



  

(a) No Person may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder
unless such Person (i) agrees to enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form and provide the representations and warranties, and indemnities
to the underwriters and the Company and to sell such Person's securities on
the basis provided in any such underwriting agreement and (ii) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements; _provided_ that no Holder of Registrable
Securities included in any underwritten offering shall be required to make
any representations or warranties to the Company or the underwriters (other
than representations and warranties regarding (A) such Holder's ownership of
its Registrable Securities to be sold or transferred free and clear of liens,
(B) such Holder's power and authority to effect, and lack of conflicts in
effecting, such transfer and (C) such matters pertaining to compliance with
securities laws as may be reasonably requested) or to undertake any
indemnification obligations to the Company, except as otherwise provided in
_Section 10(b)_ hereof, or to the underwriters, except to the extent of the
indemnification being given to the Company and its controlling persons in
_Section 10(b)_ hereof.

  



  

   

 | Ex B-22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice contemplated in
_Section 6(a)_, such Holder will promptly discontinue the disposition of its
Registrable Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement.

  



  

12. Rule 144.

  



  

With a view to making available to the Holders of Registrable Securities the
benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, the Company
covenants that it will (a) make available information necessary to comply with
Rule 144, if available with respect to resales of the Registrable Securities
under the Securities Act, at all times, and (b) take such further action as
such Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to
time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities
without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the
exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (if
available with respect to resales of the Registrable Securities), as such rule
may be amended from time to time. Upon the reasonable request of any Holder
of Registrable Securities, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written
statement as to whether it has complied with such information requirements,
and, if not, the specific reasons for non-compliance.

  



  

13. Private Placement

  



  

Except for _Section 7(a)_ and _Section 7(b)_ , the Company agrees that
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Holders, at any time and from
time to time, from selling or otherwise transferring Registrable Securities
pursuant to a private placement or other transaction which is not registered
pursuant to the Securities Act. To the extent requested by a Holder, the
Company shall take all reasonable steps to assist and cooperate with such
Holder to facilitate such sale or transfer, including providing reasonable
due diligence access to potential purchasers.

  



  

14. Transfer of Registration Rights.

  



  

The rights of a Holder hereunder may be transferred, assigned, or otherwise
conveyed on a _pro rata_ basis in connection with any transfer, assignment,
or other conveyance of Registrable Securities to any transferee or assignee
(other than a transfer pursuant to a registration statement or under Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act, and except with respect to transfers of
Demand Registration rights which may be transferred in whole and not in part
as provided in _Section 3(g)_ ); _provided_ that all of the following
additional conditions are satisfied with respect to any transfer, assignment
or conveyance of rights hereunder: (a) such transfer or assignment is
effected in accordance with applicable securities laws; (b) such transferee or
assignee agrees in writing to become subject to the terms of this Agreement
by executing a joinder or similar document; and (c) the Company is given
written notice by such Holder of such transfer or assignment, stating the name
and address of the transferee or assignee, identifying the Registrable
Securities with respect to which such rights are being transferred or assigned
and specifying whether or not the Demand Registration rights pursuant to
_Section 3_ have been assigned. Any transfer, assignment or other conveyance
of the rights of a Holder in breach of this Agreement shall be void and of no
effect.

15. Amendment, Modification and Waivers; Further Assurances.

  



  

(a) _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended with the consent of the
Company and the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit
to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the Company
shall have obtained the written consent of each of the Apollo Demand Holders,
the HGM Demand Holders and the QPAC Holders to such amendment, action or
omission to act; _provided _ that no such amendment, action or omission that
adversely affects, alters or changes the rights of any Holder in a
manner disproportionate to other similarly situated Holders shall be
effective against such Holder without the prior written consent of such
Holder.

  



  

(b) _Consents and Actions of Demand Holders_. Subject to _Section
3(g)_ , if any action or consent is requested of the Apollo Demand Holders or
the HGM Demand Holders, such action may be taken and any such consent shall be
deemed granted if and only if holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities held by the Apollo Demand Holders and holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities held by the HGM Demand Holders s take such action or
grant such consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Apollo Demand
Holder or HGM Demand Holder may request a Demand Registration, in accordance
with the terms of _Section 3(a)_.

  



  

(c) _Effect of Waiver_. No waiver of any terms or conditions of this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other breach of such terms and
conditions or any other term or condition, nor shall any failure to enforce
any provision hereof operate as a waiver of such provision or of any other
provision hereof. No written waiver hereunder, unless it by its own terms
explicitly provides to the contrary, shall be construed to effect a
continuing waiver of the provisions being waived and no such waiver in any
instance shall constitute a waiver in any other instance or for any other
purpose or impair the right of the party against whom such waiver is claimed
in all other instances or for all other purposes to require full compliance
with such provision. The failure of any party to enforce any provision of
this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of such provision and shall
not affect the right of such party thereafter to enforce each provision of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(d) _Further Assurances_. Each of the parties hereto shall execute all
such further instruments and documents and take all such further action as
any other party hereto may reasonably require in order to effectuate the terms

hereto (including any trustee in bankruptcy) whether so expressed or not. In
addition, whether or not any express assignment has been made, the provisions
of this Agreement which are for the benefit of purchasers or Holders of
Registrable Securities are also for the benefit of, and enforceable by, any

obligations hereunder, shall be effective against any Holder without the prior
written consent of such Holder.

any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to enforce such
rights specifically, to recover damages caused by reason of any breach of any
provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights existing in
their favor. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that money damages would
not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement
and that any party may in its sole discretion apply to any court of law or
equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive
relief (without posting any bond or other security) in order to enforce or
prevent violation of the provisions of this Agreement and shall not be
required to prove irreparable injury to such party or that such party does
not have an adequate remedy at law with respect to any breach of this
Agreement (each of which elements the parties admit). The parties hereto
further agree and acknowledge that each and every obligation applicable to it
contained in this Agreement shall be specifically enforceable against it and
hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for
specific performance of their respective obligations hereunder. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies available under this Agreement or otherwise.

  



  

(d) _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered

courier service), and shall be given to such party at the address or facsimile

for giving notice or taking action hereunder expires on a day which is a
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the State of New York or the jurisdiction
in which the Company's principal office is located, the time period shall
automatically be extended to the Business Day immediately following such

EXHIBIT C

  



  

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED

  



  

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

  



  

OF

  



  

[COMBINED COMPANY]

  



  

  



  



  

Pursuant to Section 245 of the

  

Delaware General Corporation Law

  



  

  



  



  

[COMBINED COMPANY], a corporation existing under the laws of the State of
Delaware (the "Corporation"), by its Chief Executive Officer, hereby
certifies as follows:

  



  

1. The name of the Corporation is "[COMBINED COMPANY]"

  



  

2. The Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation was filed in the office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 15, 2014 and the
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was filed in the office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 15, 2015, as
amended on January 19, 2017 (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ").

  



  

3. This Second Amended Restated Certificate of Incorporation restates,
integrates and amends the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation.

  



  

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was duly
adopted by joint written consent of the directors and stockholders of the
Corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections 141(f),
228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("
_GCL_ ").

  



  

5. The text of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is hereby
amended and restated to read in full as follows:

  



  

FIRST: The name of the corporation is [COMBINED COMPANY] (hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the " _Corporation_ ").

  



  

SECOND: The registered office of the Corporation is to be located at 615 S.
DuPont Hwy., Kent County, Dover, Delaware. The name of its registered agent
at that address is National Corporate Research, Ltd.

  



  

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation shall be to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the GCL.

  



  

FOURTH: The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is [350,000,000] of which
[340,000,000] shares shall be Common Stock of the par value of $.0001 per
share and [10,000,000] shares shall be Preferred Stock of the par value of
$.0001 per share.

  



  

A.  _Preferred Stock_. The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "
_Board_ ") is expressly granted authority to issue shares of the Preferred
Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for each such series such voting
powers, full or limited, and such designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights and such
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated and
expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for
the issue of such series and included in a certificate of designation (a "
_Preferred Stock Designation_ ") and as may be permitted by the GCL. The
number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased
(but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of
the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any
series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to any
Preferred Stock Designation.

  



  

   

 | Ex C-1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

B.  _Common Stock_. Except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise
provided in any Preferred Stock Designation, the holders of the Common Stock
shall exclusively possess all voting power and each share of Common Stock
shall have one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to
the stockholders on which the holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote.

  



  

FIFTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for
further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation
and of its directors and stockholders:

  



  

A. Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws of the
Corporation so provide.

  



  

B. The Board shall be divided into three classes: Class A, Class B and Class
C. The number of directors in each class shall be as nearly equal as
possible. At the first election of directors by the incorporator, the
incorporator shall elect a Class C director for a term expiring at the
Corporation's third Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Class C director shall
then appoint additional Class A, Class B and Class C directors, as necessary.
The directors in Class A shall be elected for a term expiring at the
first Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the directors in Class B shall be
elected for a term expiring at the second Annual Meeting of Stockholders and
the directors in Class C shall be elected for a term expiring at the third
Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Commencing at the first Annual Meeting of
Stockholders, and at each annual meeting thereafter, directors elected to
succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of
office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders
after their election. Except as the GCL may otherwise require, in the interim
between annual meetings of stockholders or special meetings of stockholders
called for the election of directors and/or the removal of one or more
directors and the filling of any vacancy in that connection, newly created
directorships and any vacancies in the Board, including unfilled vacancies
resulting from the removal of directors for cause, may be filled by the vote
of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, although less than a
quorum (as defined in the Corporation's by-laws), or by the sole remaining
director. All directors shall hold office until the expiration of their
respective terms of office and until their successors shall have been elected
and qualified. A director elected to fill a vacancy resulting from the death,
resignation or removal of a director shall serve for the remainder of
the full term of the director whose death, resignation or removal shall have
created such vacancy and until his successor shall have been elected and
qualified.

  



  

C. The Board shall have the power, without the assent or vote of the
stockholders, to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of
the Corporation as provided in the by-laws of the Corporation.

  



  

D. The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for
approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any
meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act
or contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by
the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which is
represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote
thereat (provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there
represented in person or by proxy) shall be as valid and binding upon the
Corporation and upon all the stockholders as though it had been approved or
ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation, whether or not the contract
or act would otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors'
interests, or for any other reason.

  



  

E. In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of
Delaware, of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
and to any by-laws from time to time made by the stockholders; provided,
however, that no by-law so made shall invalidate any prior act of the
directors which would have been valid if such by-law had not been made.

  



  

SIXTH: A. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or
limitation thereof is not permitted under the GCL as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended. If the GCL is amended to authorize corporate action
further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to
the fullest extent permitted by the GCL, as so amended. Any repeal or
modification of this paragraph A by the stockholders of the Corporation shall
not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation
with respect to events occurring prior to the time of such repeal or
modification.

  



  

   

 | Ex C-2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

B. The Corporation, to the full extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended from time to time, shall indemnify and
hold harmless each person whom it may indemnify pursuant thereto. Expenses
(including attorneys' fees) incurred by any such indemnified person in
defending any civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative action, suit
or proceeding for which such person may be entitled to indemnification
hereunder shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation as authorized hereby. The rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses conferred by this paragraph B shall be contract rights
and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation and shall inure to the
benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.

  



  

C. The Corporation hereby acknowledges that an indemnitee may have certain
rights to other indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance
(collectively, the " _Other Indemnitors_ "). The Corporation hereby agrees
that with respect to any and all losses arising by reason of the fact that
such indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
(i) that the Corporation is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its
obligations to an indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Other
Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred by such indemnitee are secondary), (ii) that
the Corporation shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses
incurred by an indemnitee in accordance with this paragraph C and shall be
liable for the full amount of all losses to the extent legally permitted and
as required by the terms of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (or any other agreement between the Corporation and an
indemnitee), without regard to any rights an indemnitee may have against the
Other Indemnitors, and, (iii) that the Corporation irrevocably waives,
relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from any and all claims
against the Other Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other
recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Corporation further agrees that
no advancement or payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an indemnitee
with respect to any claim for which such indemnitee has sought indemnification
from the Corporation shall affect the foregoing and the Other Indemnitors
shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such
advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such indemnitee
against the Corporation. The Corporation and each indemnitee agree that the
Other Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this
paragraph C.

  



  

D. Any repeal or amendment of this Article SIXTH by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Article
SIXTH, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except
to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted
prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any
right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or
adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding
(regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or
completed) arising out of or related to any act or omission occurring prior
to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

  



  

SEVENTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this
Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a
summary way of this Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or
on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this
Corporation under Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the
application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers
appointed for this Corporation under Section 279 of Title 8 of the
Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or
of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case
may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority
in number representing three fourths in value of the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and
to any reorganization of this Corporation as a consequence of such
compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said
reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said
application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of this
Corporation, as the case may be, and also on this Corporation.

  



  

   

 | Ex C-3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

EIGHTH: A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be
the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial
owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of
the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary
duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to
the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting
a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising
pursuant to any provision of the GCL or this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or the Corporation's by-laws, or (iv) any
action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or
employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each
of (i) through (iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery
determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not
consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days
following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction
of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court
of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction.

  



  

B. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of paragraph
A immediately above is filed in a court other than a court located within the
State of Delaware (a " _Foreign Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder,
such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of
Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce
paragraph A immediately above (an " _FSC Enforcement Action_ ") and (ii)
having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such FSC
Enforcement Action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign
Action as agent for such stockholder.

  



  

C. If any provision or provisions of this Article EIGHTH shall be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or
circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any
other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article EIGHTH
(including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this Article
EIGHTH containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable)
and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and
circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. Any person
or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital
stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to
the provisions of this Article EIGHTH.

  



  

NINTH: The Corporation elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the GCL.

  



  

TENTH: A. The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous
doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its
officers or directors in circumstances where the application of any such
doctrine to a corporate opportunity would conflict with any fiduciary duties
or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate or in the future. In addition to the foregoing, the
doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other corporate
opportunity with respect to any of the directors or officers of the
Corporation unless such corporate opportunity is offered to such person
solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and
such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually
permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation
to pursue.

  



  

   

 | Ex C-4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

B. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
each of the stockholders and directors of the Corporation, their respective
affiliates and all of their respective partners, principals, directors,
officers, members, managers, equity holders and/or employees, including any
of the foregoing who serve as officers or directors of the Corporation (other
than the Corporation and its subsidiaries and other than directors that are
employees of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries) (each, an "
_Exempted Person_ ") shall not have any fiduciary duty to refrain from
engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or
lines of business as the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, except as
otherwise expressly provided in any agreement entered into between the
Corporation and such Exempted Person. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Corporation, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries,
renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation and its subsidiaries
in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business
opportunities that are from time to time available to the Exempted Persons,
even if the opportunity is one that the Corporation or its subsidiaries might
reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue
if granted the opportunity to do so, and each such Exempted Person shall
have no duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity to the
Corporation (and there shall be no restriction on the Exempted Persons using
the general knowledge and understanding of the industry in which the
Corporation operates which it has gained as an Exempted Person in considering
and pursuing such opportunities or in making investment, voting, monitoring,
governance or other decisions relating to other entities or securities) and,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall not be liable to the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or stockholders for breach of any
fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of
the fact that such Exempted Person pursues or acquires such business

present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the
meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the

shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock
represented and entitled to vote thereat. At all meetings of stockholders for

to elect. Each stockholder represented at a meeting of stockholders shall be
entitled to cast one vote for each share of the capital stock entitled to vote
thereat held by such stockholder, unless otherwise provided by the
Certificate of Incorporation. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting
of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting may authorize any person or persons to act for him
by proxy. All proxies shall be executed in writing and shall be filed with

period of at least ten (10) days prior to the election, either at a place
within the city, town or village where the election is to be held, which
place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not specified,

kept at the time and place of election during the whole time thereof, and may

electronic network, the Corporation will take reasonable steps to ensure that
such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation.

principles or practices of accounting may be approved, ratified and confirmed
before or after judgment by the Board of Directors or by the holders of
Common Stock and, if so approved, ratified or confirmed, shall have the same
force and effect as if the questioned transaction had been originally duly
authorized, and said approval, ratification or confirmation shall be binding
upon the Corporation and all of its stockholders and shall constitute a bar
to any claim or execution of any judgment in respect of such questioned
transaction.

Directors, except as may be otherwise provided by law or in the Certificate of
Incorporation. Subject to the terms and conditions in the Nomination
Agreements, the number of directors which shall constitute the Board of
Directors shall be not less than one (1) nor more than eight (8). Subject to
the terms and conditions in the Nomination Agreements, the exact number
of directors shall be fixed from time to time, within the limits specified in
this Article III Section 1 or in the Certificate of Incorporation, by the

Board may be divided into Classes as more fully described in the Certificate
of Incorporation.

  



  

3.2   _Election; Term of Office; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies_.
Subject to the terms and conditions in the Nomination Agreements, each
director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders at
which his Class stands for election or until such director's earlier
resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Nomination Agreements,
vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
authorized number of directors or from any other cause may be filled by a
majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by
a sole remaining director and each director so chosen shall hold office until
the next election of the class for which such director shall have been
chosen, and until his successor shall be elected and qualified, or until such
director's earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity.

  



  

3.3   _Nominations_. Nominations of persons for election to the Board
of Directors of the Corporation at a meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation may be made at such meeting by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors, by any committee or persons appointed by the Board of Directors or
by any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of
directors at the meeting who is a stockholder of record on the date of the
giving of the notice and on the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and who complies with
the notice procedures set forth in this Article III, Section 3.
Such nominations by any stockholder shall be made pursuant to timely notice
in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's
notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive
offices of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety
(90) days prior to the meeting; provided however, that in the event that
less than seventy (70) days notice or prior public disclosure of the date of
the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder, to
be timely, must be received no later than the close of business on the tenth
(10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting

person, (b) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (c) the

other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to
determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of
the Corporation. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of
the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth
herein. The officer of the Corporation presiding at an annual meeting shall,
if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a
nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he
should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective
nomination shall be disregarded.

held immediately after and at the same place as the meeting of the

necessary to the newly elected directors in order to legally constitute the
meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. Regular meetings of the Board of
Directors may be held without notice at such time and place as shall from
time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. Special meetings of the
Board of Directors may be called by the President (including upon the written
request of at least two directors then in office) or a majority of the entire
Board of Directors. Notice thereof stating the place, date and hour of the
meeting shall be given to each director either by mail not less than seventy-

the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, a majority of the entire
Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, and at least one
director nominated by each of the HGM Group (or its affiliate or assignee) (so
long as it has the right to nominate a director in accordance with the
applicable Nomination Agreement) and Apollo (so long as it has the right to
nominate a director in accordance with the applicable Nomination Agreement)
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a
majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum
shall be the act of the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
either a director nominated by Apollo (or its affiliate or assignee) or a
director nominated by the HGM Group (or its affiliate or assignee) has
informed the Corporation in writing that it will not attend a specific meeting
and that it consents to a quorum without its presence, the presence of such
person shall not be required to constitute a quorum at such meeting;
provided, however, if a quorum shall not be present at the adjourned meeting
because either no director nominated by Apollo (or its affiliate or assignee)
or a member of the HGM Group (or its affiliate or assignee) is present, in
person or by proxy and the directors nominated by Apollo (or its affiliate or
assignee) and the HGM Group (or its affiliate or assignee) have received
written notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting in accordance
with Section 3.4, such person's presence shall not be required at the
adjourned meeting to constitute a quorum at such adjourned meeting. If a
quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of
any committee thereof, a majority of the directors present thereat may adjourn
the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or
of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of
the Board of Directors or of such committee, as the case may be, consent
thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings
or electronic transmission or transmissions are filled with the minutes
of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee.

  



  

3.8   _Removal of Directors by Stockholders_. The entire Board of
Directors or any individual Director may be removed from office with or
without cause by a majority vote of the holders of the outstanding shares then
entitled to vote at an election of directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Corporation's board is classified stockholders may effect such removal
only for cause. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Nomination
Agreements, in case the Board of Directors or any one or more Directors be so
removed, new Directors may be elected at the same time for the unexpired
portion of the full term of the Director or Directors so removed.

  



  

3.9   _Resignations_. Any Director may resign at any time by submitting
his written resignation to the Board of Directors or Secretary of the
Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time of its receipt by

resignation shall not be required to make it effective.

  



  

3.10   _Committees_. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Nomination Agreements, the Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Nomination
Agreements, in the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the
member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from
voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint
another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place
of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent
provided by law and in the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing
such committee, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of
the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to
all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the
power or authority in reference to amending the Certificate of Incorporation,
adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the
stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the
Corporation's property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a
dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution or amending

documented out-of-pocket expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of
the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed amount (in cash or other form

a stated salary as director and any other meetings or events attended on
behalf of the Corporation at the Corporation's request. No such payment shall
preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and
receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may
be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

  



  

3.12   _Interested Directors_. No contract or transaction between the
Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the
Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other
organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors
or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely
for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or
participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee
thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his
or their votes are counted for such purpose, if (i) the material facts as to
his or their relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction
are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and
the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or
transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested
directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or
(ii) the material facts as to his or their relationship or interest and as to
the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically
approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (iii) the contract or
transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized,
approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the
stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining
the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a
committee which authorizes the contract or transaction.

of Directors or any committee designed by the Board of Directors may

ARTICLE V 
  _CAPITAL STOCK_

  



  

5.1   _Form of Certificates_. The shares of stock in the Corporation
shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors
may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all
classes or series of the Corporation's stock shall be in uncertificated form.
Stock certificates shall be in such forms as the Board of Directors may
prescribe and signed by the Chairman of the Board, President or a Vice
President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary
or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation.

  



  

5.2   _Signatures_. Any or all of the signatures on a stock certificate
may be a facsimile, including, but not limited to, signatures of officers of
the Corporation and countersignatures of a transfer agent or registrar. In
case an officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be
such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued,
it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person
were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

  



  

5.3   _Lost Certificates_. The Board of Directors may direct a new
stock certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any stock
certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or
destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new stock certificate, the Board
of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such
manner as the Board of Directors shall require and/or to give the Corporation
a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

5.4   _Transfers_. Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in
the manner prescribed by law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of certificated
stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the person named
in the certificate or by such person's attorney lawfully constituted in
writing and upon the surrender of the certificate therefor, which shall be
canceled before a new certificate shall be issued. Transfers of
uncertificated stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the
person then registered on the books of the Corporation as the owner of such
shares or by such person\'s attorney lawfully constituted in writing and
written instruction to the Corporation containing such information as the
Corporation or its agents may prescribe. No transfer of uncertificated stock
shall be valid as against the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have
been entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing from
and to whom transferred. The Corporation shall have no duty to inquire into
adverse claims with respect to any stock transfer unless (a) the Corporation
has received a written notification of an adverse claim at a time and in a
manner which affords the Corporation a reasonable opportunity to act on it
prior to the issuance of a new, reissued or re-registered share certificate,
in the case of certificated stock, or entry in the stock record books of the
Corporation, in the case of uncertificated stock, and the notification
identifies the claimant, the registered owner and the issue of which the
share or shares is a part and provides an address for communications directed
to the claimant; or (b) the Corporation has required and obtained, with
respect to a fiduciary, a copy of a will, trust, indenture, articles of co-
partnership, Bylaws or other controlling instruments, for a purpose other
than to obtain appropriate evidence of the appointment or incumbency of
the fiduciary, and such documents indicate, upon reasonable inspection, the
existence of an adverse claim. The Corporation may discharge any duty of
inquiry by any reasonable means, including notifying an adverse claimant by
registered or certified mail at the address furnished by him or, if there be
no such address, at his residence or regular place of business that the
security has been presented for registration of transfer by a named person,
and that the transfer will be registered unless within thirty days from the
date of mailing the notification, either (a) an appropriate restraining
order, injunction or other process issues from a court of
competent jurisdiction; or (b) an indemnity bond, sufficient in the
Corporation's judgment to protect the Corporation and any transfer agent,
registrar or other agent of the Corporation involved from any loss which it or
they may suffer by complying with the adverse claim, is filed with the
Corporation.

5.5   _Fixing Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may determine
the stockholders entitled to notice or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any
rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date
shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date
of such meeting, nor more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date of action with a meeting is adopted by the
Board of Directors, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.
If no record date is fixed:

  



  

(a)  The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of
or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on
the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held.

  



  

(b)  The record date for determining stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior
action by the Board of Directors is necessary, shall be the first date on
which a signed written consent is delivered to the Corporation.

  



  

(c)  The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose
shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting.

  



  

5.6   _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to due presentment for transfer
of any share or shares, the Corporation shall treat the registered owner
thereof as the person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notifications
and to all other benefits of ownership with respect to such share or shares,
and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or
interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or
not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise
provided by the laws of the State Delaware.

  



  

ARTICLE VI 
  _NOTICES_

  



  

6.1   _Form of Notice_. Notices to directors and stockholders other
than notices to directors of special meetings of the board of Directors which
may be given by any means stated in Article III, Section 4, shall be in
writing and delivered personally or mailed to the directors or stockholders
at their addresses appearing on the books of the corporation. Notice by mail
shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be mailed.
Subject to the rules of any applicable stock exchange, notice to
stockholders and directors may also be given by telegram or email. If
delivered by email, such notice shall be deemed to be given when the email is
sent by the originator. The time stamp on the sent email shall act as proof of
service.

  



  

6.2   _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be given
under the provisions of law or the Certificate of Incorporation or by these
Bylaws of the Corporation, a written waiver, signed by the person or persons
entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be
deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends
a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of
the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor
the purpose of, any regular, or special meeting of the stockholders,
Directors, or members of a committee of Directors need be specified in any
written waiver of notice unless so required by the Certificate of
Incorporation.

  



  

ARTICLE VII 
  _INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS_

  



  

7.1  The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party
or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by
reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding. The termination of any
action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon
a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which
he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

  



  

   

 | Ex D-10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.2  To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 1 of this Article, or in
defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified
against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by him or her in connection therewith.

  



  

7.3 The Corporation hereby acknowledges that an indemnitee may have
certain rights to other indemnification, advancement of expenses
and/or insurance (collectively, the "Other Indemnitors"). The Corporation
hereby agrees that with respect to any and all losses arising by reason of
the fact that such indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
(i) that the Corporation is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its
obligations to an indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Other
Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred by such indemnitee are secondary), (ii) that
the Corporation shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses
incurred by an indemnitee in accordance with this Article VII and shall be
liable for the full amount of all losses to the extent legally permitted and
as required by the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws
(or any other agreement between the Corporation and an indemnitee), without
regard to any rights an indemnitee may have against the Other Indemnitors,
and, (iii) that the Corporation irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases
the Other Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Other Indemnitors
for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. The Corporation further agrees that no advancement or payment by the
Other Indemnitors on behalf of an indemnitee with respect to any claim for
which such indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Corporation shall
affect the foregoing and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of
contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment
to all of the rights of recovery of such indemnitee against the Corporation.
The Corporation and each indemnitee agree that the Other Indemnitors are
express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Article VII.

  



  

7.4  Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or
director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the
final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount
if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section. Such
expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other employees and agents
may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of
Directors deems appropriate.

  



  

7.5 Any repeal or amendment of this Article VII by the stockholders of
the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision
of the Amended and Restated Certificate and the Bylaws inconsistent with this
Article VII, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only
(except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than
permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely
affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any
proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced
or completed) arising out of or related to any act or omission occurring
prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision. 

  



  

7.6  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to the other sections of this Article shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.

  



  

7.7  The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability
asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out
of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article.

  



  

   

 | Ex D-11|

7.8  For purposes of this Article, references to "the Corporation"
shall include, in addition to the resulting Corporation, any constituent
Corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would
have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and
employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer
employee or agent of such constituent Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of such constituent Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article with respect
to the resulting or surviving Corporation as he would have with respect to
such constituent Corporation of its separate existence had continued.

  



  

7.9  For purposes of this Article, references to "other enterprises"
shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any
excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan;
and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include
any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation
which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer,
employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants
or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a
manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to
in this Article.

  



  

7.10  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Article shall, unless otherwise provided when
authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

  



  

7.11  No director or officer of the Corporation shall be personally
liable to the Corporation or to any stockholder of the Corporation for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII 
  _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

  



  

8.1   _Reliance on Books and Records_. Each Director, each member of
any committee designated by the Board of Directors, and each officer of the
Corporation, shall, in the performance of his duties, be fully protected in
relying in good faith upon the books of account or other records of the
Corporation, including reports made to the Corporation by any of its officers,
by an independent certified public accountant, or by an appraiser selected
with reasonable care.

  



  

8.2   _Maintenance and Inspection of Records_. The Corporation shall,
either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as
designated by the Board of Directors, keep a record of its stockholders
listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by
each stockholder, a copy of these by-laws, as may be amended to date, minute
books, accounting books and other records.

  



  

Any such records maintained by the Corporation may be kept on, or by means
of, or be in the form of, any information storage device or method, provided
that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible paper form
within a reasonable time. The Corporation shall so convert any records so
kept upon the request of any person entitled to inspect such records pursuant
to the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. When records are
kept in such manner, a clearly legible paper form produced from or by means of
the information storage device or method shall be admissible in evidence, and
accepted for all other purposes, to the same extent as an original paper form
accurately portrays the record.

  



  

Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall,
upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right
during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the
Corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books
and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall
mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder.
In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the
right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of
attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to
so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed
to the Corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal
executive office.

  



  

   

 | Ex D-12|

8.3   _Inspection by Directors_. Any director shall have the right to
examine the Corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its
other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her
position as a director.

  



  

8.4   _Dividends_. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation, if any, dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation
may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting,
pursuant to law. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of
the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of
any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the
Directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a
reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or
for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for such
other purpose as the Directors shall think conducive to the interest of the
Corporation, and the Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the
manner in which it was created.

Corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other persons
as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.

8.8   _Amendments_. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Nomination Agreements, the original or other Bylaws may be adopted, amended
or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon at any regular or
special meeting or, if the Certificate of Incorporation so provides, by the
Board of Directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the
Board of Directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power nor limit
their power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws.

  



  

8.9   _Interpretation of Bylaws_. All words, terms and provisions of
these Bylaws shall be interpreted and defined by and in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended, and as amended
from time to time hereafter. In the event that the provisions of these Bylaws
and the Nomination Agreements conflict, the provisions of the Nomination
Agreements shall take precedence over these Bylaws.
