privileges intended to be conveyed to Purchaser or retained by or transferred
to the Seller Entities under this Agreement and the Seller Documents and to

which asset or Liability was transferred to Purchaser or its Designated
Affiliate(s) at the Closing or retained by BPP and (ii) transferring to

Retained Asset, Assumed Liability or BPP Agreed Liability, as applicable,
which was not transferred to Purchaser or its Designated Affiliate(s) at

(b) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign
any Transferred Asset, including any Contract, Permit or other right, which
by its terms or by Law is nonassignable without the consent of a Third Person
or is cancelable by a Third Person in the event of an assignment (" _Non-
Assignable Assets_ ") unless and until such consent shall have been obtained.
With respect to Contracts and Permits that constitute Non-Assignable Assets,
the Seller Entities shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser
at its request for up to 90 days



 

32 following the Closing Date to obtain such consents promptly; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such cooperation shall not require Seller or any of its
Affiliates to incur any Expenses or provide any financial accommodation or to
remain secondarily or contingently liable on any Contract or Permit to obtain
any such consent with respect to any such Non-Assignable Asset, except to the
extent that Purchaser has agreed in writing to reimburse Seller for such
Expenses or indemnify Seller for remaining secondarily liable or contingently
liable; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Seller Entities shall
be obligated to continue to spend any unused balance of the $250,000

(c) To the extent permitted by Law, in the event consents to the assignment
of any Non-Assignable Asset cannot or will not be obtained and the Closing
nevertheless occurs, at Purchasers request, such Non-Assignable Assets shall
be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by the applicable Seller Entity or
the applicable Affiliate of such Seller Entity in trust for Purchaser and the
covenants and obligations thereunder and Liabilities incurred in connection
therewith (to the extent such Liabilities are Assumed Liabilities) shall
be performed by Purchaser in such Seller Entitys or such Affiliates name
and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall be for Purchasers
account. The Seller Entities shall take or cause to be taken at
Purchasers expense such lawful actions in its name or otherwise as Purchaser
may reasonably request so as to provide Purchaser with the benefits of the
Non-Assignable Assets and to effect collection of money or other consideration
that becomes due and payable under the Non-Assignable Assets, and the
applicable Seller Entity or the applicable Affiliate of such Seller Entity
shall promptly pay over to Purchaser all money or other consideration received
by it in respect of all Non-Assignable Assets;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
such obligations of any Seller Entity shall not extend beyond the remaining
term of such Contract or Permit as of the Closing Date. As of and from the
Closing Date, each Seller Entity on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
authorizes Purchaser, to the extent permitted by Law and the terms of the Non-
Assignable Assets, at Purchasers expense, to perform all the obligations and
receive all the benefits of the Seller Entities or their Affiliates
under each of the Non-Assignable Assets that constitutes a Contract and shall
appoint Purchaser its attorney-in-fact to act in its name on its behalf or in
the name of the applicable Affiliate of such Seller Entity and on such
Affiliates behalf with respect thereto pursuant to the Powers of Attorney to
be delivered by the Seller Entities at Closing.



(d) The Seller Entities and Purchaser agree that after the Closing they will
hold and will promptly transfer and deliver, from time to time as and
when received by them, any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements (using
their commercially reasonable efforts not to convert such checks into cash),
or other property that they may receive after the Closing Date which properly
belongs to the other party (including any insurance proceeds), and will
account to the other parties for all such receipts. From and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall have the right and authority to endorse without
recourse the name of any Seller Entity on any check or any other evidences of
indebtedness received by Purchaser with respect to any account receivable or
other monies owing on account of the Business to the extent included in the
Transferred Assets, and, at the Closing, the Seller Entities shall execute
and deliver Powers of Attorney to evidence the same.



2.6 _Purchase Price Allocation_. _Schedule 2.6_ sets forth a statement (the "
_Asset Acquisition Statement_ ") allocating the Total Consideration among the
BPP Stock and the



 

33 Transferred Assets. The Total Consideration paid by Purchaser for the BPP
Stock and the Transferred Assets shall be allocated in accordance with the
Asset Acquisition Statement and all income Tax Returns and reports filed by
Purchaser and Seller shall be prepared consistently with such allocation.
Seller and Purchaser agree to complete Form 8594 consistently with such
allocation and to furnish each other with a copy of such Form prepared in
draft form, at least 45 days prior to the due date of such form.



2.7 _Bulk Sales Compliance_. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by the Seller
Entities with the requirements and provisions of any "bulk transfer" Laws of
any jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to any sale of
any or all of the Transferred Assets to Purchaser.



2.8 _Insurance Proceeds_. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, (i) any loss or damage to the improvements or other
tangible personal property included in the Transferred Assets and the BPP
Retained Assets shall occur from fire, casualty or any other occurrence, (ii)
the Seller Entities or BPP do not at their discretion replace or restore such
property prior to the Closing Date and (iii) the Closing occurs, then all
insurance proceeds received by the Seller Entities or BPP (whether before or
after Closing) as a result of the occurrence of the event resulting such loss
or damage will be delivered by the Seller Entities to Purchaser or retained
by BPP, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller Entities shall
not otherwise have any obligation to replace or restore any such property if
such insurance proceeds are assigned to Purchaser. Seller shall have the sole
right and authority to provide notices and claims to the applicable insurance
carrier and otherwise to communicate and negotiate with such carrier, but
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such
proceeds payable to the Seller Entities or BPP. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the benefit of any insurance proceeds in relation to "business
interruption" damages based upon lost profits or business opportunities in
respect of the period prior to the Closing Date, and insurance proceeds in
relation to such loss or damage to the extent attributable to any such
property replaced or restored before the Closing Date or otherwise used for
such purposes, will inure to the benefit of and be payable to the Seller
Entities or BPP, as applicable, and Purchaser will not be entitled to receive
or retain such proceeds.

Working Capital after giving effect to the adjustments required in the Agreed
Principles (" _Reference Statement_ "). Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, provide the Purchaser with
copies of and reasonable access to such books, records, work papers and

Unadjusted Purchase Price reduced by the amount of such deficiency, subject to
further adjustment as provided below. In the event that the Prior Month
Working Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital, the Purchase Price
shall be the Unadjusted Purchase Price increased by the amount of such
excess, subject to further adjustment as provided below.



(c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but no later than ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared
and delivered to Seller the Closing Statement (as defined below) and a
certificate based on such Closing Statement setting forth Purchasers
calculation of Closing Working Capital and certifying that the Closing
Statement was prepared in accordance with GAAP in all material respects,
consistent with past practice, the Reference Statement and the Agreed
Principles. The closing statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") shall present
the Net Working Capital as of the Applicable Time (the " _Closing Working
Capital_ ").



(d) If Seller disagrees with Purchasers calculation of Closing Working
Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ , Seller may, within thirty
(30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to
Purchaser setting forth Sellers objection thereto and Sellers calculation
of such amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or
amounts as to which Seller disagrees, and Seller and the other Seller Entities
shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in
the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_. If Seller does not deliver a notice of objection
within such thirty (30) day period, Seller and the other Seller Entities
shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in the
Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_.



(e) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to  _Section
3.3(d)_ , Purchaser and Seller shall, during the thirty (30) days following
such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on
the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required,
the amount of Closing Working Capital, which amount shall not be less than
the amount thereof shown in Purchasers calculation delivered pursuant to
_Section 3.3(c)_



 

35 nor more than the amount thereof shown in Sellers calculation delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_. If during such period, Purchaser and Seller are
unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause certified
public accountants resident in an office of KPMG LLP that have not performed
services for Purchaser or Seller (" _KPMG_ ") (or if unable or unwilling to
accept its mandate, an independent accountant to be mutually agreed upon by
Purchaser and Seller) (KPMG or such other independent accountant, as the case
may be, the " _Accounting Referee_ ") to review this Agreement and the
disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Working
Capital (it being understood that in making such calculation, the Accounting
Referee shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). In
making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those
items or amounts in the Closing Statement and Purchasers calculation of
Closing Working Capital as to which Seller has disagreed. The Accounting
Referee shall deliver to Purchaser and Seller, as promptly as practicable (but
in any case no later than thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the
Accounting Referee), a report setting forth such calculation. Such report
shall be final and binding upon Purchaser, Seller and the other Seller
Entities. The cost of such review and report shall be borne proportionately by
Purchaser and Seller. Purchaser shall be responsible for the proportion of
such cost equal to the quotient of (A) the difference of (w) Purchasers
calculation of Closing Working Capital minus (x) the Accounting Referees
calculation of Closing Working Capital divided by (B) the difference of (y)
Purchasers calculation of Closing Working Capital minus (z) Sellers
calculation of Closing Working Capital. Seller shall be responsible for the
proportion of such cost equal to the quotient of (A) the difference of (w)
Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital minus (x) the Accounting
Referees calculation of Closing Working Capital divided by (B) the difference
of (y) Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital minus (z) Purchasers
calculation of Closing Working Capital.



(f) Purchaser and the Seller Entities shall, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the
Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital and in the
conduct of the review referred to in this _Section 3.3_ , including the making
available, to the extent necessary, of books, records, work papers and
personnel and affording Seller the opportunity to observe and participate in
any physical inventory.



(g) In the event that Final Working Capital (as defined below) is less than
the Prior Month Working Capital, Seller shall pay to Purchaser, in the
manner and with interest as provided in _Section 3.3(i)_ , the amount of such
difference as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, and, if Final Working
Capital exceeds Prior Month Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, in
the manner and with interest as provided in _Section 3.3(i)_ , the amount of
such excess as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. " _Final Working Capital_
" means Closing Working Capital: (i) as shown in Purchasers calculation
delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ if no notice of disagreement with
respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ ; or (ii) if
such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed by Purchaser and
Seller pursuant to _Section 3.3(e)_ or (B) in the absence of such agreement,
as shown in the Accounting Referees calculation delivered pursuant to
_Section 3.3(e)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Final
Working Capital be more than Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital
delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ or less than Purchasers calculation of
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_. Attached
hereto as _Schedule 3.3(g)_ is an example of a calculation pursuant to this
_Section 3.3(g)_.



 

36 (h) (i) An additional adjustment to the Purchase Price will be made by
increasing the Purchase Price by the amount (the " _Shutdown Adjustment
Amount_ ") by which the Shutdown Accrual/Asset Balance, determined in
accordance with _Schedule 3.3(h)_ , at the Applicable Time is greater than
$8,396,000 (the " _Target Shutdown Accrual Amount_ "). At least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser its reasonable estimate of the Shutdown Accrual/Asset Balance as of
the Applicable Time (the " _Shutdown Estimate_ "). Such estimate shall set
forth in reasonable detail the Sellers estimate of such Shutdown
Accrual/Asset Balance in accordance with _Schedule 3.3(h)_. Prior to the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, provide the
Purchaser with copies of and reasonable access to such books, records, work
papers and personnel as are reasonably necessary for purposes of verifying the
amounts set forth in the Shutdown Estimate. In the event that the Shutdown
Estimate is less than the Target Shutdown Accrual Amount, no adjustment shall
be made to the Purchase Price. In the event that the Shutdown Estimate is
greater than the Target Shutdown Accrual Amount, the Purchase Price shall be
the Unadjusted Purchase Price increased by the amount of such excess, subject
to further adjustment as provided above and below.



(ii) The procedures (including time periods) provided above with respect to
Purchasers calculation and certification of Closing Working Capital,
delivery of the Closing Statement, Sellers right to dispute the same,
resolution of any such dispute by the Accounting Referee, and determination of
Final Working Capital shall also apply to the determination of the
final Shutdown Adjustment Amount.



(i) Any payment pursuant to  _Section 3.3(g)_ shall be made at a mutually
convenient time and place within three Business Days after Final Working
Capital has been determined by wire transfer by Seller or Purchaser, as the
case may be, of immediately available funds to the account of such other
party as may be designated in writing by such other party. Any payment
pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)(ii)_ shall be made at a mutually convenient time
and place within three Business Days after the Shutdown Adjustment Amount has
been determined by wire transfer by Purchaser of immediately available funds
to the account of Seller. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to
_Section 3.3(g)_ or _(h)(ii)_ shall bear interest from (and including) the
Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of payment at a rate per annum equal
to the "prime rate" as published by the Wall Street Journal from time to time
during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest
shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and
shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty five
(365) days and the actual number of days elapsed.

69 ARTICLE VII



COVENANTS



7.1 _Access to Information_. (a) Seller agrees that, prior to the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall be entitled, through its Representatives
(including, its legal advisors, accountants, financiers, and financiers
counsel), to make such reasonable investigation of the Business, the
Transferred Assets, the BPP Retained Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the BPP
Agreed Liabilities, the BPP Excluded Assets and BPP Indemnified Liabilities
and such examination of the books, records and financial condition of BPP and
the Business as it reasonably requests and to make extracts and copies of such
books and records, in each case pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (as modified by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Seller Entity is under any
obligation to disclose to Purchaser or its Representatives (or to cause BPP
to disclose to Purchaser or its Representatives) (i) any information the
disclosure of which is restricted by Law, (ii) any information that would
materially jeopardize, in the reasonable opinion of Seller, any privilege
available to the Seller Entities or BPP, (iii) any information that would
cause the Seller Entities or BPP to breach in any material respect a
confidentiality obligation to which it is bound, or (iv) any confidential
personnel records or data; _provided_ ,  _further_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall be entitled to require reasonable additional protections, including
through redaction of documents or additional agreements from or restrictions
on personnel with access, where it believes in good faith that that the same
are necessary to protect confidential information from potential use by a
competitor; and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Seller Entities
shall, and Seller shall cause BPP to, use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the restrictions addressed in
clauses (ii) and (iii) above and shall take all such reasonable measures

consult with Purchasers counsel, entering into one or more joint defense or
common interest agreements with Purchaser and seeking waivers of the
applicable confidentiality agreement) to permit the greatest possible
disclosure of information to Purchaser and/or its counsel consistent with the
preservation of privilege or the applicable confidentiality obligation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any provision of this Agreement (including
_Section 7.10_ ) specifies the scope and nature of Purchasers investigation
with respect to a particular matter, Purchasers investigation shall be
governed by such provision and not this _Section 7.1_. For the avoidance of
doubt, prior to the Closing, Seller agrees to make available to Purchasers
finance department access to Sellers credit managers, historical payment
information and credit lines information with respect to the Business, in lieu
of access to credit review and analysis with respect to the Business. Any
investigation and examination hereunder shall be conducted during regular
business hours and under reasonable circumstances, and the Seller Entities
shall, and Seller shall cause BPP to, cooperate reasonably therein. No
investigation by Purchaser prior to or after the date of this Agreement shall
diminish or obviate any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Seller Entities contained in this Agreement or the Seller
Documents. In order that Purchaser may have the opportunity to make such
physical, business, accounting and legal review, examination or investigation
as it may reasonably request of the affairs of the Seller Entities or BPP, the
Seller Entities shall, and Seller shall cause BPP to, cause their respective
Representatives to provide reasonable cooperation with such Representatives in
connection with such review and examination.

to pay the Purchase Price, including facilitating customary due diligence by
Purchasers financing sources and their Representatives, participation in
meetings and providing access to documents and financial reports as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser and its Affiliates, all subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and the terms and conditions of this Agreement
applicable to Purchasers investigation. The Seller Entities shall, and Seller
shall cause BPP to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and
assist, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the independent
accountants for the Seller Entities and BPP to, cooperate and assist
Purchaser, its Affiliates and their Representatives in preparing such
information packages and offering materials as the Purchasers lenders,
underwriters or other financing sources may reasonably request (collectively,
the " _Offering Materials_ ") for use in connection with the offering and/or
syndications of debt securities, loan participations and other matters in
connection with the financing transactions (the " _Offerings_ "), including
using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make senior management and other
Representatives of the Business and BPP available (at mutually agreeable
times) to participate in meetings with prospective investors, participate in
"road shows" in connection with any such Offerings and participate in meetings
with rating agencies and causing the present independent accountants for the
Business and BPP to participate in drafting sessions related to the
preparation of the Offering Materials and make work papers available to the
Purchaser and its Affiliates, the underwriters and their respective
Representatives; (ii) engage Ernst and Young LLP for and cooperate in the
preparation of an audited (A) balance sheet for the fiscal years ended January
3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, and (B) statements of cash flows and income for
the fiscal year ended January 3, 2004, in each case, of the Business, (iii)
assisting in real estate title and related security documentation in
connection with any secured financing; and (iv) provide such other information
and assistance as the Purchasers lenders and/or underwriters and their
respective Representatives may reasonably request in connection therewith.
Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller Entities and BPP for all reasonable and
documented out of pocket Expenses (including the Expenses incurred in
connection with the audit described above) incurred by the Seller Entities or
BPP in connection with their compliance with the provisions of this clause
(b). The provisions of this clause (b) shall not expand the Seller Entities
Liabilities under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or require any
Seller Entity or Affiliate or Representative thereof to incur any Liability or
Loss not otherwise agreed to hereunder, disclose any information except as
provided in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or make any
representations, warranties or indemnities or deliver any agreements with or
certificates or similar documents to any of Purchasers financing sources or
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.



(c) Prior to the Applicable Time, Seller shall cause to be delivered to
Purchaser financial statements for the Business for each fiscal month in the
form kept by Seller in the Ordinary Course of Business, commencing with the
month that includes the date hereof, within five (5) Business Days after the
last day of such fiscal month. In addition, prior to the Applicable Time,
Seller shall cause to be delivered to Purchaser financial statements for the
Business including consolidated balance sheets, statements of income,
stockholders equity and cash flows for the quarter ended April 3, 2004 and
each quarter thereafter in a format not materially different than the format
presented in the January 3, 2004 audited financial statements. However, the
quarterly financial statements will not provide footnote disclosures. Prior

71 Applicable Time, such quarterly financial statements will be provided within
(i) forty-five (45) days after the last day of the fiscal quarter end with

equity and (ii) fifty (50) days after the last day of the fiscal quarter end

foregoing, Seller and/or LRFP shall have the right to grant such
ministerial consents or waivers as may be necessary or desirable to effect
the consummation of the transactions being effected by and/or contemplated

closing of such transactions and do not adversely affect the interests, rights
or obligations of the Purchaser in any way.

reasonable efforts to assist Seller in obtaining, for the benefit of
Purchaser, either (x) consents to the assignment of partial licenses or the
grant of sublicenses, or (y) separate license agreements, to use the Included
Third Party Licensed Software on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser after the Closing.



(ii) With respect to any Included Third Party Licensed Software for which
either (A) a consent to the assignment of a partial license or the grant of a
sublicense thereof to Purchaser, or (B) a separate license agreement for the
benefit of Purchaser has not been obtained prior to Closing, Seller shall,
after the Closing, use its commercially reasonable efforts, and Purchaser
shall reasonably cooperate with Seller, to obtain at the earliest
practicable date, consent to the temporary use of such Included Third Party
Licensed Software until the Seller obtains (x) either (I) a consent to the
assignment of a partial license or the grant of a sublicense or (II) a
separate license agreement for the benefit of Purchaser to use such Included
Third Party Licensed Software or (y) an alternative or substitute arrangement
that is operationally equivalent and reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.



(iii) Purchaser shall have the right to participate in any negotiations to
obtain such consents, license or sublicense agreements or alternative or
substitute arrangements. Seller shall be solely responsible for the payment of
all license fees, any fees associated with obtaining consents to use or
assign such license agreements or grant sublicenses, and similar fees in
connection with obtaining the rights for Purchaser as set forth in this
_Section 7.3(b)_ (other than (A) any costs or fees incurred or paid by
Purchaser in connection with its cooperation, participation, and review of
documents arising from Sellers fulfillment of its obligations under this
_Section 7.3(b)_ ) or (B) in connection with obtaining any upgrades or any new
or additional maintenance or support obligations from a Third Person for any
Included Third Party Licensed Software).



(iv) Purchaser and Seller agree to reasonably cooperate in good faith to
determine whether any maintenance agreements with Third Persons for any
Included Third Party Licensed Software (" _Maintenance Agreements_ "), to the
extent pre-paid by any of the Seller Subs in connection with the operation of
the Mills, can be apportioned such that the Purchaser can, after the Closing,
continue to receive third party maintenance for the Included Third Party
Licensed Software as it was provided to the Business prior to the Closing, or
in as substantially similar a manner as is possible given the size of the
Business, amounts pre-paid or attributable to payments made by the Seller
Entities in respect of the operation of the Mills, and any new third party
maintenance obtained and paid for, or to be paid by Purchaser, and in such
case, to reasonably cooperate in good faith to obtain, for the benefit of
Purchaser, such rights to such third party maintenance



 

76 for the Included Third Party Licensed Software during a commercially
reasonable period after the Closing,  _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the payment of any and all fees for
any new third party maintenance (including the extension of current
maintenance services or maintenance agreements, and the negotiation of new
maintenance agreements, if any,) for the Included Third Party Licensed
Software and (B) Seller shall not be required to apportion any Maintenance
Agreement if such apportionment (x) is conditional on Sellers renegotiation
of such Maintenance Agreement or (y) will materially adversely affect the
rights of Seller or materially diminish the obligations of the applicable
third party maintenance provider Seller had, in any applicable Maintenance
Agreement, prior to the Closing.



(v) Purchaser hereby (A) acknowledges that all of the consents of, or
licenses or sublicenses from, Third Persons required to permit the Purchasers
use of the Included Third Party Licensed Software after the Closing shall not
constitute Required Consents and (B) acknowledges that the failure to obtain,
for the benefit of Purchaser, any consent of, or license or sublicense from,
any Third Person required to permit the Purchasers use of the Included Third
Party Licensed Software shall not constitute a breach of any covenant of the
Seller Entities in this Agreement to the extent the Seller Entities have
complied with their respective obligations under this _Section 7.3(b)_.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that
the Multi-Mill Contracts shall not be deemed to be Transferred Assets
hereunder.



7.4 _Antitrust Approvals_. Each of Purchaser and the Seller Entities shall,
and Seller shall cause BPP to, (i) make or cause to be made all filings
required of each of them or any of their respective Affiliates under the HSR
Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Law, Orders, or administrative
or judicial doctrines that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or any foreign investment Laws (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ ") with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement or such
other period as may be commercially reasonable for the filing in question in
the case of all filings required under Antitrust Laws, (ii) comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents, or other materials
received by each of them or any of their respective Affiliates from the FTC,
the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Body in respect of such
filings or such transactions, and (iii) cooperate with each other in
connection with any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by Law,
providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to
filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or
other Governmental Body under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such
filing or any such transaction. Each such party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Law in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such party shall
promptly inform the other parties hereto of any substantive oral communication
with, and provide copies of substantive written communications with, any
Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No
party hereto shall



 

77 independently participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental Body in
respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving
the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate. Subject to Law, the parties hereto will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under
the Antitrust Laws. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided herein, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be required
(i) to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of its
businesses, product lines or assets, or any of the Transferred Assets or the
BPP Retained Assets, (ii) to agree to any limitation on the operation or
conduct of the Business, or (iii) to waive any of the conditions to this
Agreement set forth in _Section 9.1_. Purchaser and Seller shall each pay one-
half of the filing fees and any associated translation costs payable in
connection with the filings to the extent required under Antitrust Laws with
respect to jurisdictions identified on _Schedule 7.4_.



7.5 _Satisfaction of Conditions; Offshore Purchase Agreements_. (a) Subject
to _Section 7.4_ , each of the Seller Entities and Purchaser shall, and Seller
shall cause BPP to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause the fulfillment at
the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) The transfer of the Transferred Assets and assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities of GPGmbH and GPHK will be effected pursuant to separate
purchase agreements or instruments (the " _Offshore Purchase Agreements_ ") in
form and substance reasonable acceptable to each party, and (i) consistent
with the underlying principles of this Agreement, (ii) consistent with the
requirements of local Law and (iii) with such terms as may be reasonably
agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller regarding employees and employee benefits
matters in order to adapt such agreement to the particular circumstances of
GPGmbH and GPHK and the Laws governing the employees of such entities,
provided that any such terms shall be consistent with the principles
underlying the corresponding provisions of this Agreement. The parties shall
finalize and, if necessary, enter into the Offshore Purchase Agreements as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, none of the Designated
Affiliates of Seller or Purchaser or any Seller Entity that is organized
under the Laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or a State or
territory thereof shall be jointly and severally liable on any Liabilities
hereunder or under any Seller Document or Purchaser Document if and to the
extent such joint and several liability is not permitted under the Law of the
jurisdiction of organization of such Seller Entity or Designated Affiliate.



(c) To the extent any Designated Affiliate executing an Ancillary
Agreement or any Assignment and Assumption Agreement is not also the entity
to which the Mills are transferred at the Closing, Purchaser shall provide and
cause its Designated Affiliates to provide at Closing documents or instruments
reasonably satisfactory to Seller pursuant to which Purchaser and any
Designated Affiliate to which the Mills are transferred at the Closing shall
be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the Designated
Affiliate under such Ancillary Agreement or Assignment and Assumption
Agreement.



 

78 7.6 _Exclusive Dealings_.



(a) From the date hereof until the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Article IV_ or the Closing Date, whichever shall first occur, Seller will
not, and will not permit any of its Representatives or the other Seller
Entities or BPP or their respective Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, discuss, negotiate, undertake, authorize, recommend, propose or
enter into, either as the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired
corporation, any transaction involving a merger, consolidation, business
combination, purchase or disposition of any amount of the Transferred Assets,
the BPP Retained Assets, the Business or any capital stock of any of the
other Seller Entities or BPP other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(b) From the date hereof until the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Article IV_ or the Closing Date, whichever shall first occur, Seller
agrees not to release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill

Entities or BPP is a party.



7.7 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Confidentiality_.



(a) (i) For a period from the Closing Date until the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), Seller shall not and shall cause
its Affiliates not to directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control or
participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of
any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or
otherwise, engaged in the manufacture, production, distribution or sale of
fluff pulp (a " _Restricted Business_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the restrictions contained in this _Section 7.7(a)_ shall not restrict (A)
the acquisition, in one or more transactions, by Seller or its Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, of less than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of
any publicly traded company engaged in a Restricted Business or (B) the
acquisition, by merger, stock or asset purchase or otherwise, by Seller or its
Affiliates, directly or indirectly, of a business or businesses, in the
aggregate, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or
otherwise, engaged in the Restricted Business if such business (1) derives no
more than 7% of its consolidated revenues or net income from such Restricted
Business on an annual basis and (2) has a market share (as determined by
Resource Information Systems, Inc.) of no more than 10% of the fluff pulp
market. The parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy
at law for any breach of the foregoing will be inadequate and that
Purchaser, in addition to any other relief available to it, shall be entitled
to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever.



(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
acquires an interest, by merger, stock or asset purchase or otherwise, in one
or more transactions, in a Restricted Business that would, individually or in
the aggregate, violate clause (i)(B) above, Seller shall (x) promptly notify
Purchaser of such fact in writing and (y) have a period of twelve (12) months
to come into compliance with this provision through the sale or other
disposition of all of such interest(s) to a Third Person. If Seller



 

79 complies with the requirements set forth in the prior sentence, Seller and its
Affiliates shall not be deemed to be in violation hereof by virtue of the
activities of such company or business. In connection with any divestiture
contemplated by this clause (ii), Seller shall first offer the opportunity to
purchase any such Restricted Business to Purchaser.



(iii) Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller acquires an interest, by merger, stock or asset purchase or otherwise,
in a Restricted Business that does not violate clause (i)(B) above at the time
of such acquisition, Seller shall be prohibited from expanding such
Restricted Business above the lesser of (A) 10% of the production capacity of
such Restricted Business on the date of its acquisition or (B) the percentage
of production capacity of such Restricted Business on the date of
its acquisition, when aggregated with the production capacity of any other
Restricted Businesses owned by Seller or its Affiliates, that would not cause
all of such Restricted Businesses to violate clause (i)(B) above.



(b) Subject to _Section 7.7(c)_ below, for a period of eighteen months after
the Closing Date, Seller shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to: (i)
cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employees who are or become employees
of Purchaser or BPP with respect to the Business to leave such employment; 
_provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit general
solicitations of employment not specifically directed toward employees of
Purchaser or its Affiliates or the hiring of such employees in response
thereto, nor the hiring, employment or engagement of any employee of
Purchaser or its Affiliates who presents himself for employment without direct
or indirect solicitation by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller; or (ii) cause,
induce or encourage any material actual or prospective client, customer,
supplier, or licensor of the Business (including any existing or former
customer of the Seller Entities or BPP) or any other Person who has a material
business relationship with the Business as of the Closing Date, to terminate
or modify any such actual or prospective relationship (the " _Non-Solicitation
Obligation_ ").



(c) If Seller or an Affiliate of Seller acquires an interest in a Restricted
Business (other than an acquisition permitted under _Section 7.7(a)(i)(A)_ ),
even one that does not violate _Section 7.7(a)(i)(B)_ above, then, regardless
of whether the Non-Solicitation Obligation has expired, the Non-Solicitation
Obligation shall extend from the date of such acquisition until
the expiration of five (5) years after the Closing Date.



(d) For a period of eighteen months after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
not and shall cause its Affiliates not to cause, solicit, induce or encourage
any employees who (i) are or, after the Closing Date, become employees of
Seller or its Affiliates related to the Excluded Assets or the BPP Excluded
Assets or (ii) any former employees of the Business who remain employed with
the Seller or its Affiliates after Closing to leave such employment;
_provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit general
solicitations of employment not specifically directed toward employees of
Seller or its Affiliates or the hiring of such employees in response thereto,
nor the hiring, employment or engagement of any employee of Seller or
its Affiliates who presents himself for employment without direct or indirect
solicitation by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser.



 

80 (e) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, Seller shall not
and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective officers, and directors
not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to
any Person other than authorized Representatives of Purchaser or its
Affiliates or use or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit
of anyone other than Purchaser or its Affiliates, any Purchaser Confidential
Information (as defined below). Seller and its Representatives and Affiliates
shall not have any obligation to keep confidential any Purchaser Confidential
Information if and to the extent disclosure thereof is required by Law or
legal process, is reasonably necessary to the defense of any Excluded
Liability or BPP Indemnified Liability or the pursuit of any claim with
respect to the Excluded Assets or the BPP Excluded Assets, or is necessary
for purposes of performing under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
enforcing any rights under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event disclosure is required by Law or
legal process, Seller shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide
Purchaser with prompt notice of such requirement prior to making any
disclosure so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective Order. For
purposes of this _Section 7.7(e)_ , " _Purchaser Confidential Information_ "
shall mean any confidential information primarily relating to BPP (other than
the BPP Excluded Assets or the BPP Indemnified Liabilities), the Transferred
Assets, the BPP Retained Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the BPP Agreed
Liabilities or the Business, including Transferred Business Intellectual
Property. " _Purchaser Confidential Information_ " does not include, and
there shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i)
is Seller Confidential Information, (ii) is generally available to the public
or is otherwise in the public domain on the Closing Date, (iii) becomes
either generally available to the public or is otherwise in the public domain
or is known by the recipient, in any such case other than as a result of a
disclosure by a Person not otherwise permissible under any confidentiality
agreement with Purchaser or its Affiliates, (iv) is independently developed
by or for Seller after the Closing Date without the use of or reliance on
(directly or indirectly) any Purchaser Confidential Information or (v) is an
Excluded Asset. In connection with its obligations under this _Section
7.7(e)_ , Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce, at Purchasers request and
expense, the terms of any confidentiality agreement to which Seller or any
of its Affiliates are a party that protects any Purchaser Confidential
Information.



(f) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not
and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective officers, and directors
not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to
any Person other than authorized Representatives of Seller or its Affiliates
or use or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone
other than Seller or its Affiliates, any Seller Confidential Information
(as defined below). Purchaser and its Representatives and Affiliates shall
not have any obligation to keep confidential any Seller Confidential
Information if and to the extent disclosure thereof is required by Law or
legal process, is reasonably necessary to the defense of any Assumed
Liability or BPP Agreed Liability or the pursuit of any claim with respect to
the Transferred Assets or the BPP Retained Assets, or is necessary for
purposes of performing under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
enforcing any rights under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event disclosure is required by Law or
legal process, Purchaser shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide
Seller with prompt notice of such requirement prior to making any disclosure
so that Seller may seek an appropriate protective Order. For purposes of this
_Section 7.7(f)_ , " _Seller Confidential Information_ " shall mean any
confidential information relating to the BPP Excluded Assets, the Excluded
Assets, the



 

81 Excluded Liabilities, and any business or operation of Seller or its
Affiliates other than the Business, including methods of operation,
customers, customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs, inventions, Trade
Secrets, know-how, Software, marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers,
competitors, markets or other specialized information or proprietary matters.
" _Seller Confidential Information_ " does not include, and there shall be no
obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is Purchaser
Confidential Information, (ii) is generally available to the public or
is otherwise in the public domain on the Closing Date, (iii) becomes either
generally available to the public or is otherwise in the public domain or is
known by the recipient, in any such case other than as a result of a
disclosure by a Person not otherwise permissible under any confidentiality
agreement with Seller or its Affiliates or (iv) is independently developed by
or for Purchaser after the Closing Date without the use of or reliance on
(directly or indirectly) any Seller Confidential Information.



(g) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in
a final nonappealable judgment determines that a specified time period, a
specified geographical area, a specified business limitation or any other
relevant feature of this _Section 7.7_ is unreasonable, arbitrary or against
public policy, then a lesser time period, geographical area, business
limitation or other relevant feature which is determined to be reasonable, not
arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced against the applicable
party. 



7.8 _Preservation of Records; Post-Closing Cooperation_. Except in the
Ordinary Course of Business of such party regarding its own general records or
in compliance with such partys records retention policies (but in any event
as long as may be required by Law), Seller and Purchaser agree that each of
them shall preserve and keep the records relating to the Business that are
held by it or their Affiliates immediately after the Closing for a period of
seven (7) years from the Closing Date, or, if longer, as required by Law.
Seller and Purchaser agree that each of them shall make (or cause its
respective Affiliates to make) such records (other than information or records
which are the subject of attorney-client privilege or the disclosure of which
is prohibited by Law), including the personnel records of BPP Employees and
personnel available to the other and their respective accountants, counsel and
other representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, as may be reasonably necessary by such party in connection with,
among other things, financial reporting and accounting matters, any insurance
claims by, Legal Proceedings against or governmental investigations of Seller
or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, the preparation and filing of any
returns, reports or forms or the defense of, or response required under, or
pursuant to the defense of any Indemnification Claim in accordance with
_Article X_ , the defense of any Excluded Liability or BPP Indemnified
Liability or the pursuit of any claim with respect to the Excluded Assets or
the BPP Excluded Assets, or in order to enable the Seller Entities or
Purchaser to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement and
each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby.
In the event Seller or Purchaser wishes to destroy (or permit to be destroyed)
such records (unless such destruction is to occur in the Ordinary Course of
Business of the party destroying such books and records, or in compliance
with such partys general record retention policies, in either case not in
violation of Law), such party shall first give ninety (90) days prior written
notice to the other and such other party shall have the right at its option
and expense, upon prior written notice given to such party within that ninety
(90) day period, to take possession of the records within one hundred and
eighty (180) days after the date of such notice. After the Closing, each of
Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and



 

82 Purchaser, on the other, agrees to deliver promptly to each other all mail and
other documents (other than any mail or document which is the subject of
attorney-client privilege or the disclosure of which is prohibited by Law)
received by such party which relate to the business conducted by such other
party or its Affiliates after the Closing. Cooperation with respect to Tax
matters shall be governed by _Section 11.11_.



7.9 _Publicity_.



(a) Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall, and Seller and Purchaser shall each
cause their respective Affiliates not to, issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party hereto (which
for this purpose shall be Seller or Purchaser, as applicable), which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of
Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, disclosure is otherwise required by Law
or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Purchaser or Seller
lists securities, _provided_ that, even in such circumstances, the party
intending to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
consistent with such Law to consult with the other party with respect to the
text thereof. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller intends to issue a press
release and make other public announcements upon the execution of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the content of any such press
release and public announcement is subject to and in compliance with this
clause (a).



(b) Each of Purchaser and the Seller Entities agrees that the terms of this
Agreement shall not be disclosed or otherwise made available to the public
and that copies of this Agreement shall not be publicly filed or otherwise
made available to the public, except where such disclosure, availability or
filing is required by Law (including as an Exhibit to Sellers Form 10-K) and
only to the extent required by such Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties hereto acknowledge and understand that this Agreement will be filed by
Seller with the Securities and Exchange Commission and made publicly
available and the parties agree that such filing will be not be deemed to
violate this _Section 7.9(b)_.



7.10 _Environmental Matters_.



(a) The Seller Entities shall, and Seller shall cause BPP to, permit Purchaser
and Purchasers environmental consultant(s) to conduct an investigation (the
" _Phase II Assessment_ ") of the environmental conditions of any Properties
(subject to any relevant limitations contained in valid, previously executed
leases and subject to the limitations set forth in this  _Section 7.10_ with
respect to Purchasers Phase II Assessment) as set forth in the scope of work
attached hereto as _Schedule 7.10(a)_ and any follow-on work as described in
subparagraph (b)(iv) below. Purchasers Phase II Assessment shall be
conducted by one or more qualified environmental consulting firms, possessing
reasonable levels of insurance, in compliance with Laws and in a manner that
minimizes the disruption of the operations of the Seller Entities and BPP. 



 

83 (b) Purchasers access and the access by Purchasers environmental consulting
firm(s) to the Properties and BPP Excluded Real Property for purposes of the
Phase II Assessment shall be limited as follows:



(i) The environmental consulting firm(s) selected by the Purchaser for the
Phase II Assessment (the " _Phase II Environmental Consultant_ ") shall be
reasonably acceptable to Seller and shall prepare a report solely to the
Purchaser with respect to the Properties. Seller agrees that RMT Environmental
Consultants, Inc. is acceptable to it to serve as the Phase II Environmental
Consultant, and further agrees that if the Purchaser selects another
environmental consulting firm for the Phase II Assessment, Sellers approval
of such firm shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Seller
Entities shall, and Seller shall cause BPP to, and the Purchaser shall, each
use their reasonable efforts to fulfill their respective obligations under
_Schedule 7.10(a)_. In addition, Purchaser shall cause the Phase II
Environmental Consultant to use its reasonable efforts to fulfill its
obligations under _Schedule 7.10(a)_. By way of amplification of, and not in
limitation of, the foregoing, the Seller Entities shall, and Seller shall
cause BPP to, provide to Purchaser and the Phase II Environmental Consultant
reasonable access to the employees of or consultants to the Business who are
most familiar with the matters which are the subject of the Phase II
Assessment and/or have responsibility for environmental matters.

 



(ii) The Phase II Environmental Consultant may begin drilling and collecting
soil, groundwater, and sediment samples in accordance with _Schedule 7.10(a)_
after providing notice to Seller at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
date on which such activities are scheduled to begin, so as to allow Sellers
representative to be present. The Phase II Environmental Consultant shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the Phase II Assessment in a manner
that does not unreasonably interfere with Sellers operations, does not
damage improvements, and does not have an adverse effect on the health, safety
or welfare of the environment or persons. The access agreement to be entered
into by the parties prior to such Phase II Assessment is attached as
_Schedule 7.10(b)(ii)_.



(iii) Upon receipt of the Phase II Assessment results, Purchaser shall
provide a general oral description of the factual findings to Seller. Further,
during such discussion, Purchaser shall orally provide Seller with its
estimate of the cost or range of costs of any Remedial Actions or other
Environmental Costs and Liabilities necessary to address such factual
findings, if such estimates have been made by Purchaser or its consultants. If
no such estimates have been made, if requested by Seller and
reasonably practicable, Purchaser will or will cause its consultant to do so
in good faith and will orally communicate the same to Seller and Seller shall
provide any information reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection
therewith. Seller acknowledges that the actual costs of any Remedial Action
may exceed such estimate and such estimate shall not affect any of Sellers
obligations under _Section 10.3_. Upon, and only upon, the written request of
Seller, Purchaser shall cause the Phase II Environmental Consultant to
provide to Seller a written copy of the Phase II Environmental Consultants
factual findings resulting from the Phase II Assessment, and shall cause the
Phase II Environmental Consultant to respond to factual inaccuracies, if any,
identified by Seller with respect to such findings. Purchaser shall provide a
copy of the final factual findings contained in the Phase II Assessment to
Seller if Seller so requests.



 

84 (iv) Prior to the Closing or continuing beyond Closing if it is not feasible
to complete prior to Closing, Purchaser shall have the right to conduct Phase
II Assessment activities in addition to those described on _Schedule 7.10(a)_
if and to the extent such additional activities are necessary to further
define or characterize the results of the Phase II Assessment or would be
required by Environmental Law; _provided_ that any such additional activities
will be undertaken only with the prior approval of Seller, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



(v) After Closing, neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall conduct or
permit the conduct by any Third Person of any sampling of soil or groundwater
at the Mills except such sampling that is for a Legitimate Business Purpose.



(c) The costs and expenses incurred to conduct the Phase II Assessment
shall be the responsibility of Purchaser. Any and all Environmental Costs and
Liabilities incurred to conduct a Remedial Action related to matters
identified in the Phase II Assessment shall be the responsibility of the
Seller Entities pursuant to  _Section 10.3_.



(d) (i) As between the Parties, except as set forth below, Seller shall have
full authority to control, direct, manage and implement all Remedial Actions
at the Properties that relate to (1) matters set forth in _Schedule
10.3(a)(i)_ (Existing Environmental Matters), (2) matters identified during
or as a result of the Phase II Assessment, or if discovered after Closing
pursuant to a continuation of the Phase II Assessment permitted pursuant to
_Section 7.10(b)(iv)_ , for which timely written notice is provided
to Seller, (3) matters described in _Section 10.3(a)(v)_ (Continuing
Environmental Issues), but only where Seller is allocated more than fifty
percent (50%) of the Environmental Costs and Liabilities for such Continuing
Environmental Issue, and (4) unknown environmental issues for which notice is
provided to Seller and for which Seller is responsible and which are covered
by _Section 10.3(b)(iii)_ , hereinafter collectively the " _Seller Remedial
Actions_ ,"  _provided_ , that Seller may contract with Purchaser to perform
Seller Remedial Actions on mutually agreeable terms.



(ii) Except as to the matters set forth on _Schedule 10.3(a)(i)_ , Purchaser
shall have the authority to conduct all negotiations, meetings and
settlements with Governmental Bodies that relate to all Remedial Actions. With
respect to Seller Remedial Actions, Seller may participate in such meetings,
negotiations, and settlements to the extent allowed by the Governmental Body
and approved by Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.



(iii) For Seller Remedial Actions, the Purchaser shall have the right to
review and provide Seller comments in advance of (1) the Sellers selection
of consultants and contractors designated to perform the Remedial Action and
(2) the development of the scope of work for, and type of, the Remedial Action
to be implemented. The Seller shall review and in good faith
consider Purchasers comments. To the extent feasible, the Seller shall
provide Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all
drafts of correspondence, including work plans, updates and reports, prior to
submittal to any Governmental Body. Seller shall reasonably consider and, if
reasonable and appropriate, incorporate Purchasers comments. Seller shall
provide Purchaser with copies of written correspondence with Governmental
Bodies that relates to Seller Remedial Actions.



 

85 (iv) Seller Remedial Actions are to be performed in a manner that complies
with Environmental Law and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to conduct the Seller Remedial Actions in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere, after consultation among the parties, with Purchasers or BPPs
operations, as determined by Purchaser in its sole and reasonable discretion.



(v) Any contractors performing Seller Remedial Actions will be subject to
Purchasers security requirements, environmental and safety procedures,
contractor qualification standards, work rules and regulations then in place
relating to persons and property.



(vi) If Seller does not agree to Purchasers recommendations, and such
recommendations have a material impact on the cost or scope of the Remedial
Action or on Purchasers or BPPs operations, the Parties shall have
the opportunity to present the dispute to a committee consisting of one
environmental specialist and one member of senior management from each Party
with authority to bind their respective company (the " _Monitoring Committee_
"), which shall endeavor to use a good faith effort to resolve the dispute on
a fair and equitable basis.



(e) As between the Parties, except with respect to Seller Remedial Actions,
Purchaser shall have full authority to control, direct, manage and
implement all Remedial Actions, and to determine the scope of all such
Remedial Actions, and to conduct all negotiations, meetings and settlements
with Governmental Bodies that relate to the Properties, _provided_ that
Purchaser may contract with Seller to perform Remedial Actions on mutually
agreeable terms. To the extent that Seller has an indemnity obligation under
_Section 10.3_ hereof, the Seller shall have the right to review and provide
Purchaser comments in advance of (1) the Purchasers selection of consultants
and contractors designated to perform the Remedial Action and (2) the
development of the scope of work for, and type of, the Remedial Action to be
implemented. Purchaser shall review and in good faith consider Sellers
comments. To the extent feasible, the Purchaser shall provide Seller with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all drafts of correspondence,
including work plans, updates and reports, prior to submittal to
any Governmental Body. Purchaser shall reasonably consider Sellers comments
and incorporate such comments if reasonable and appropriate. Purchaser shall
provide Seller with copies of written correspondence with Governmental Bodies
that relates to such Remedial Actions. If Seller and Purchaser cannot agree
on the other Partys recommendations, and such recommendations have a material
impact on the cost of the Remedial Action or on Purchasers or BPPs
operations, the Parties shall have the opportunity to present the dispute to
the Monitoring Committee, which shall endeavor to use a good faith effort to
resolve the dispute on a fair and equitable basis.



(f) (i) After the Closing, no Seller Entity shall, and no Seller Entity shall
cause or permit its respective Affiliates or Representatives to, provide any
notification or disclosure to any Governmental Body or other third party of
any matters related to environmental conditions at the Properties, including
but not limited to Hazardous Materials present on or under 



 

86 the Properties, without Purchasers prior written consent, unless any such
notification or disclosure is required by applicable Environmental Law. In
the event any Seller Entity believes that any such notification or disclosure
is required by applicable Environmental Law, such Seller Entity shall notify
Purchaser as soon as possible so that Purchaser may make any such legally
required notification or disclosure. In the event Purchaser fails or refuses
to make any such legally required notification or disclosure, the Seller
Entity may make such notification or disclosure upon the Seller Entitys
receipt of written advice of counsel that such notification or disclosure is
required by applicable Environmental Law to be made by such Seller Entity, and
then the Seller Entity shall disclose only such information as required by
such Environmental Law. The Seller Entity shall notify Purchaser prior to so
notifying or disclosing information to a Governmental Body or other third
party, provide a copy of any such notification or disclosure to Purchaser, and
permit Purchaser to take the lead role in and control any discussions or
negotiations with such Governmental Body or Third Person that result from the
notification or disclosure; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller Entity
shall, upon written request to Purchaser, be entitled to participate in such
discussions and receive relevant correspondence.



(ii) In the event Purchaser, any of its Affiliates, Representatives,
successors or permitted assigns, any Purchaser Indemnified Party, or anyone
subject to Purchasers control, discloses to a Governmental Body information
regarding Hazardous Materials present on or under any of the Properties that
is not required to be disclosed by Law, Order, or Permit and/or is not
disclosed in a legally required response to a request (oral or written) by a
Governmental Body, and Environmental Costs and Liabilities are incurred by
any Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of such voluntary disclosure, any
Environmental Costs and Liabilities resulting from such disclosure shall be
the responsibility of Purchaser, and not of any Seller Entity,
notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary.



(g) Purchaser shall be responsible for applying for all Permits required under
Environmental Law as a result of or in furtherance of the
transactions contemplated hereunder, including all requests for the transfer
or re-issuance of the Environmental Permits required to conduct the Business
after the Closing Date. The Seller Entities shall, and Seller shall cause BPP
to, cooperate in all reasonable respects with Purchaser with respect to any
filings necessary to transfer Environmental Permits required for Purchaser to
conduct the Business after the Closing Date. Within forty-five (45) days after
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have in place appropriate financial
assurance mechanisms required by Environmental Law in substitution of those
maintained by Seller and shall notify Seller when such financial assurance
mechanisms are completed and submitted to the appropriate Governmental Body.
If Purchaser, after utilizing reasonable efforts, is unable to make any such
substitution, Purchaser shall continue to make such efforts, but Sellers
financial assurance mechanisms shall remain in place; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for the cost of such financial
assurance mechanisms and all related reasonable and out-of-pocket Expenses. In
no event shall Seller be required to maintain in place such financial
assurance mechanisms beyond one year after Closing.



(h) In the event any Remedial Action for which Seller has or may have any
responsibility hereunder involves remediation of groundwater at the
Properties, the Remedial Action may be carried out using the wastewater
treatment system on the Properties at no cost to 



 

87 Seller, if such use is allowed by Environmental Law and does not result in an
incremental increase to Purchaser of the cost of operating the wastewater
treatment system, or, if so, such costs shall be reimbursed to Purchaser by
Seller. In the event the use of the wastewater treatment systems under this
Section threatens to cause, or causes, a violation of Environmental Law,
Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, deny use of the wastewater treatment
systems and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller
to attempt to reach a solution that will allow such usage to resume as
soon as practicable and as allowed by Environmental Law.



(i) In the event any Remedial Action involves remediation of contaminated
soil or other media, and subject to Purchasers written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Remedial Action may be carried
out (i) if the Remedial Action takes place at the Brunswick Pulp and Paper
Mill, using the active landfill known as Active Landfill #5, and (ii) if the
Remedial Action takes place at Leaf River, using the Main Landfill, at no cost
to the Seller, if such use is allowed by Environmental Law and does not
result in a material reduction in the useful life of the landfill as
determined by Purchaser in its reasonable judgment. In the event the use of
either landfill under this Section threatens to cause, or causes, a violation
of Environmental Law, Purchaser may, it its sole discretion, deny use of such
landfill and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Seller to attempt to reach a solution that will allow such usage to resume as
soon as practicable and as allowed by Environmental Law.



7.11 _Asset Transfers_. Prior to the Applicable Time, Seller shall, at its
own expense, cause BPP to (i) transfer and divest to Seller or its
Affiliate(s) all BPP Excluded Assets and (ii) be fully released from the
Liabilities of BPP set forth on _Schedule 7.11_. Such transfer documents
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. To the
extent the IDBs are not owned by LRFP immediately prior to the Applicable
Time, Seller shall cause the IDBs to be transferred to LRFP on or immediately
prior to the Applicable Time. Any transfer documents entered into in
connection with such transfer shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser.



7.12 _Assignment and Assumption of the Leaf River Mill Lease; Transfer of the

(a) Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_
and _9.2_ hereof (or the waiver hereof by the party entitled to waive that

rights under the Leaf River Mill Lease and each of the IDB Documents to
Purchaser and (iii) GNN shall be released from its obligations under the IDB
Guaranty, in each case pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of

efforts to obtain, prior to the Applicable Time, the consent and approval of

Modification Agreements, and (ii) LRFP, as the sole owner and holder of the
IDBs, shall consent to the release of GNN from the IDB Guaranty pursuant to
the terms of the Assignment, Assumption and Modification Agreements.



 

88 (c) Unless waived by the party entitled to waive such further action, Seller
shall take, and shall cause each of LRFP, GNN and LRCT to take, all such
further action, as may be necessary to comply with the terms and conditions of
the Leaf River Mill Lease, the IDB Indenture, and the IDB Guaranty in
connection with the consummation of transactions contemplated in this
_Section 7.12_.



7.13 _Assignment and Assumption of the Leaf River Pollution Control
Facilities Lease; Alternate Letter of Credit; Mandatory Tender and Remarketing
of PCRR Bonds_.



(a) Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_
and _9.2_ hereof (or the waiver hereof by the party entitled to waive that
condition), at the Closing, Purchaser shall assume all of the obligations of
LRFP under the Leaf River Pollution Control Facilities Lease and LRFP shall
assign all of its rights under the Leaf River Pollution Control Facilities
Lease and each of the PCRR Bond Documents to Purchaser in each case pursuant
to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Assignment, Assumption, and
Modification Agreements.



(b) In accordance with the terms of the Leaf River Pollution Control
Facilities Lease and the PCRR Bond Indenture, each of the parties hereto
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the
Applicable Time, the consent and approval of Perry County and the PCRR Bond
Trustee to the Assignment, Assumption and Modification Agreements.



(c) Seller shall take, and cause LRFP to take, all such further action,
as provided for and required under the terms of the PCRR Bond Documents, (i)
to obtain the consent of Perry County and the PCRR Bond Trustee to the
transactions described in _Section 7.13(a)_ hereof, (ii) to effectuate the
substitution of an Alternate Letter of Credit for the BOA LOC on the Closing
Date (including delivery of the requisite notices and other materials required
to be delivered in connection with any such substitution, but excluding those
materials required to be delivered by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 7.13(d)_
), and (iii) to cause, on the Closing Date, the existing BOA LOC to be
returned to the issuer thereof for cancellation without having been drawn, or
if drawn, to cause the issuer thereof to be fully reimbursed for such drawing
from the proceeds of a remarketing of the PCRR Bonds on the Closing Date.
Seller and Purchaser shall each be responsible for one-half of any Expenses
incurred by Perry County, the IDB Trustee and the PCRR Trustee in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(d) Purchaser shall, at the sole cost of Purchaser, take all action, including
the delivery of the opinion of counsel required by Section 4.5 of the Leaf

required to be taken by the Seller in accordance with _Section 7.13(c)_
hereof to provide for the issuance, on or prior to the Closing Date, of an
Alternate Letter of Credit which complies with the terms of the Leaf River
Pollution Control Facilities Lease and the PCRR Bond Indenture.

cause (a) the Fixed Rate Bonds to be defeased on or prior to the Closing Date
in accordance with the Fixed Rate Bond Indenture, (b) any related Liens other

the Closing Date and (c) the Fixed Rate Bond Lease to be terminated and fee
simple title to the Project (as such term is defined in the Fixed Rate Bond
Lease) to be transferred to Purchaser in accordance herewith not later than
the Closing Date.



 

89 7.15 _Brunswick Bond Financed BPP Retained Assets_.



(a) Seller intends for the Brunswick Bonds to remain outstanding
following the Closing Date and Purchaser acknowledges that Seller has made
available to Purchaser and its Representatives a complete copy of the
Brunswick Bond Documents. Purchaser is willing to take certain action as
specified in this _Section 7.15_  with respect to the BPP Retained Assets
financed with the proceeds of the Brunswick Bonds.



(b) _Schedule 7.15(b)_ sets forth a detailed list specifying the items of the
BPP Retained Assets (the " _Brunswick Bond Assets_ ") financed with the
proceeds of the Brunswick Bonds, the use of which may affect the continued
qualification of Brunswick Bonds as tax exempt bonds under the Code. Such list
shall identify each specific material asset and its location.



(c) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause BPP to continue to use the Brunswick Bond Assets in a manner
substantially consistent with their current use or otherwise consistent with
such use as would not impair the tax-exempt status of the Brunswick Bonds and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Seller with written
notice at least 60 Business Days prior to terminating such use of such
Brunswick Bond Assets. Purchasers obligation hereunder shall continue with
respect to a Brunswick Bond Asset only so long as the related Brunswick Bonds
are outstanding and otherwise qualify for tax exempt status under the Code,
and Seller shall give Purchaser immediate notice of the redemption of any
Brunswick Bonds and of any other circumstance that would relieve Purchaser of
its obligations hereunder.



(d) Purchasers only obligation under this  _Section 7.15_ is to use and
provide notices with respect to the Brunswick Bond Assets in accordance with
its undertaking in _Section 7.15(c)_. None of the Sellers rights under the
Brunswick Bond Documents shall be assigned to Purchaser nor shall the
Purchaser assume, in any way, any obligations under the Brunswick Bond
Documents, and Purchaser shall have no obligation with respect to the
Brunswick Bonds or the other Brunswick Bond Documents, to any issuer,
Governmental Body, bond counsel or other obligor with respect to any
Brunswick Bond or to any holder of a Brunswick Bond or any of the Brunswick
Bond Documents, and Purchaser shall not be liable to Seller or any other
Person with respect to the tax exempt status of the Brunswick Bonds or any
other obligations relating thereto.



7.16 _Title Commitments and Surveys_.



(a) (i) The Seller Entities have obtained and furnished to Purchaser the
Existing Title Commitments issued by Chicago Title Insurance Company (the "
_Title Insurer_ ") for each Owned Property and the Leaf River Mill Leasehold
Property (each Existing Title Commitment, together with any amendment,
revision or update of same from time to time delivered to Purchaser, a "
_Title Commitment_ ").



 

90 (ii) The Seller Entities have obtained and furnished (or caused to be
furnished) to Purchaser for each of the Owned Properties and the Leaf River
Mill Leasehold Property (on an individual or composite basis) the Existing
Surveys, which, as of the date hereof, do not meet the requirements set forth
on the checklist attached hereto on _Schedule 7.16(a)(ii)_ (the " _Checklist_
"). Seller will instruct the surveyors issuing the Existing Surveys to update
such surveys to meet the requirements of the Checklist and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish or cause to be furnished to
Purchaser updated Existing Surveys that are in substantial compliance with
such Checklist within ten (10) days after the date hereof (each Existing
Survey, as revised or updated from time to time, a " _Survey_ "); _provided_
that the Seller Entities have not furnished, and shall not be obligated to
furnish, a Survey for the Old Augusta Railroad. For informational purposes, at
the request of Purchaser, the Approved Surveyor for the Leaf River Pulp Mill
also has platted or will plat that the real property of the Old Augusta
Railroad is contiguous with the real property of the Canadian National Railway
(or its Affiliate) at the point where the Old Augusta Railroad interchanges
with the Canadian National Railway (or its Affiliate).



(iii) The costs of the Title Commitments (if separate from the Title Insurance
Policies) and the Surveys shall be split equally (one-half each) by Seller and
Purchaser.



(b) Purchaser shall have until the fifteenth (15th) Business Day
after Purchasers receipt of updated Existing Surveys in substantial
compliance with the Checklist and the corresponding Title Commitments issued
after receipt of the updated Existing Surveys in substantial compliance with
the Checklist (the " _Title Review Period_ ") to notify Seller, in writing,
of its objection to any Title Defects shown on such Survey or on the
corresponding Title Commitment. If Purchasers written objection is not
received by Seller within the Title Review Period, Purchaser shall be deemed
to have approved all Title Defects and other matters indicated on such Survey
and corresponding Title Commitment. If Purchaser timely objects in writing to
one or more such Title Defects as provided for above, Seller may, at Sellers
discretion, endeavor to cure such objections by either eliminating such Title
Defects or causing the Title Insurer to insure over such Title Defect(s)
within forty-five (45) days after Purchasers delivery of a notice of
objection. If Seller does not cure each Title Defect to which Purchaser has
timely objected within the time periods specified above, then Purchaser may,
as its sole remedy for the existence of any such Title Defect and such failure
to cure each such Title Defects, terminate this Agreement by delivering
written notice to Seller within five (5) Business Days after the expiration of
the forty-five (45) day time period specified above. For the avoidance of
doubt, but without limiting other objections that Purchaser may raise with
respect to such matters, Purchaser shall not be entitled to require Seller to
obtain a release of mineral rights previously reserved by prior owners of the
Owned Properties and the Leaf River Mill Leasehold Property in connection
with Purchasers objections to the Title Commitments and the Surveys.



(c) Seller and Purchaser shall each pay at Closing one-half of the premium for
Purchasers title insurance policies (the " _Title Insurance Policies_ ")
based on the agreed upon allocated value for the Owned Properties and the Leaf
River Mill Leasehold Property, with extended coverage and including the
following endorsements to the extent available in the relevant
jurisdiction and applicable and obtainable with respect to the Properties
(with any



 

91 applicable limitations given the Surveys (or lack thereof in the case of the
Old Augusta Railroad)): (i) comprehensive, (ii) land same as survey, (iii)
zoning 3.1, (iv) access, (v) separate tax lot, (vi) subdivision, and (vii)
contiguity. In the event that Purchaser elects (or is required by its lender)
to obtain additional endorsements to any such title insurance policy,
Purchaser shall do so at its sole cost and expense. In the event that
Purchaser elects to obtain lenders policies of title insurance at the
Closing, the amounts for which Seller is responsible under the first sentence
of this  _Section 7.16(c)_ shall be determined without reference to the
lenders insurance (as though such lenders insurance were not also being
issued); _provided_ , that Seller shall not be obligated to incur any cost or
expense in connection with the obtaining of such lenders policies (including
the cost of any reinsurance requested or required by such lender).



(d) At Closing, Seller shall promptly deliver any closing affidavits and
documentary evidence reasonably requested by the Title Insurer necessary to
issue the Title Insurance Policies and the endorsements listed in _Section
7.16(c)(i)_ - _(vii),_ consistent with the Seller Entities representations
and warranties given herein; _provided_ that Purchaser shall be responsible
for any deliverables (other than the Survey) necessary for issuing the Zoning
3.1 endorsement and for issuing any other endorsement not expressly set forth
above.



7.17 _Intellectual Property_.



(a) Purchaser agrees that within six (6) months after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall remove, obliterate, cover or replace, as appropriate all
signs, billboards, containers, drums, advertisements, vehicle and equipment

product tags, labels, packaging, forms, business cards and other media
containing the GP Marks located on any of the Properties, including signs,
billboards and advertisements or other media located at Brunswick Pulp and Paper
Mill or the Leaf River Pulp Mill; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser
shall not be obligated to remove GP Marks from any product inventory (or any
product tags, packaging or labels thereon) on hand or in transit as of the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall have no obligation to remove the mark "Golden
Isles Fluff" or any other Mark which is included in the Transferred
Intellectual Property. During any period that Purchaser is using the GP Marks
as provided in this Section, it shall take commercially reasonable steps to
inform customers, suppliers and contractors that it is not part of Seller and
is using the GP Marks with permission solely to facilitate transition of the
Business.



(b) (i) The Seller Entities, to the extent they or any of them own or control
the Copyrights and Trade Secrets described below in this _Section 7.17(b)(i)_
, grant to each of Purchaser and BPP effective as of the Closing Date, a non-
exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable, perpetual and
irrevocable right and license to make, have made, use, market, import,
sell, offer to sell, reproduce, perform, display, prepare derivative works
of, and otherwise disclose or exploit products, services, methods and
processes that use, are made using, require the use of, incorporate, comprise,
or are otherwise based upon any Copyrights and/or Trade Secrets that are (A)
not a part of Transferred Intellectual Property and (B) used in and necessary
for the continued operation of the Business as the Business is conducted as of
the Closing Date. Purchaser and BPP shall have the right to assign or
sublicense, without notice to or consent of any of the Seller Entities, the
foregoing license to (1) any Affiliate of Purchaser or BPP, (2) a purchaser of
all or substantially all of the Business or any business or facility
of Purchaser or BPP, or (3) any entity resulting from a merger, acquisition,
consolidation,



 

92 re-organization, or spin-off of any businesses or facilities of Purchaser or
BPP or resulting from acquisition of all or substantially all of the stock or
assets of Purchaser or BPP. The Seller Entities agree that neither Purchaser
nor BPP is required to share with any of the Seller Entities or account to any
of the Seller Entities for any royalty or other revenue received or any
disclosures made regarding the licensed subject matter.



(ii) Purchaser and BPP, to the extent they or any of them own or control the
Copyrights and Trade Secrets described below in this _Section 7.17(b)(ii)_ ,
grant to the Seller Entities effective as of the Closing Date, a non-
exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable, perpetual and
irrevocable right and license to make, have made, use, market, import, sell,
offer to sell, reproduce, perform, display, prepare derivative works of,
and otherwise disclose or exploit products, services, methods and processes
that use, are made using, require the use of, incorporate, comprise or are
otherwise based upon any Copyrights and/or Trade Secrets that are (A) part of
Transferred Intellectual Property but not exclusively used in the Business
and (B) used in any other facility of the Seller Entities as of the Closing
Date. The Seller Entities shall have the right to assign or sublicense,
without notice to or consent of Purchaser or BPP, the foregoing license to
(1) any Affiliate of the Seller Entities, (2) a purchaser of any facility or
business of the Seller Entities, or (3) any entity resulting from a merger,
acquisition, consolidation, re-organization, or spin-off of any businesses or
facilities of the Seller Entities or resulting from acquisition of all or
substantially all of the stock or assets of the Seller Entities. Purchaser and
BPP agree that the Seller Entities are not required to share with Purchaser or
BPP or account to Purchaser or BPP for any royalty or other revenue received
or any disclosures made regarding the licensed subject matter.



(c) The Seller Entities and Purchaser agree the corporate name and trade name
"Leaf River Forest Products, Inc." is not being assigned by the Seller
Entities to Purchaser or its Affiliates. Each of the Seller Entities agrees
that it will not object to, contest, oppose or otherwise challenge any use of
the words "Leaf River" by Purchaser or its Affiliates as part of a
corporate name, trade name, trademark, service mark, logo or domain name,
provided that, for so long as any of the Seller Entities is using the
corporate name and trade name "Leaf River Forest Products, Inc.," the use by
Purchaser or its Affiliates of the words "Leaf River" is not in combination
with the words "Forest Products."



7.18 _Plant Shutdown and Annual Maintenance_. Prior to the Closing, the Seller
Entities shall, and Seller shall cause BPP to, (i) cause the Brunswick Pulp and
Paper Mill and the Leaf River Pulp Mill to cease operations as is necessary to
conduct annual maintenance on the equipment at such mills and (ii) to complete
the maintenance items set forth on _Schedule 7.18_ with respect to
such Mills. Purchaser shall have the right to have an observer present during
all annual maintenance operations conducted at such mills; _provided_ that
Seller shall have the right to control and/or limit the activities of such
observer in its sole discretion for purposes of maintaining safety standards
and the efficiency of the maintenance operations, and Purchaser shall keep, or
cause its observer to keep, in full force and effect during such operations
such insurance coverages regarding the activities of such observer as Seller
may reasonably request, with Seller and its Affiliates as additional named
insureds. Purchaser shall provide Seller with certificates of insurance
reflecting such coverages prior to such observers attendance at such
maintenance operations.



 

93 7.19 _Intercompany Accounts_. Prior to or at the Closing, the Seller Entities
shall cause all intercompany obligations payable to or receivable by Seller
and its Affiliates in respect of the Business or BPP to be terminated,
cancelled or paid in their entirety and any other intercompany Liabilities to

Affiliates shall execute mutual releases in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser.



7.20 _Intermediary_. Purchaser agrees that Seller may, in its sole discretion,
assign its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement with respect
to any real property included in the Transferred Assets, in whole or in part,
to a "qualified intermediary" within the meaning of Treasury Reg. Sec.
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4), as provided in Treasury Reg. Sec. 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v); 
_provided_ that Seller shall notify Purchaser prior thereto and shall provide
a copy of such assignment agreement to Purchaser for its review and approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Purchaser agrees
to pay the portion of the Purchase Price allocable to any such real property
to such intermediary as required by Treasury Reg. Sec. 1.1031(k)-1(g). Any
Losses incurred as a result of the assignment to such intermediary shall be
the sole responsibility of Seller. Purchasers only obligation under this
_Section 7.20_ is to pay the portion of the Purchase Price allocable to any
such real property to the intermediary and Purchaser shall have no Liability
to Seller or any other Person for any Losses incurred in connection with such
transfer, including the failure of such transfer to qualify as a like kind
exchange under Section 1031 of the Code. Any assignment to an intermediary as
contemplated herein shall not alter Purchasers or Sellers liability to each
other for its obligations, representations and warranties otherwise stated in
this Agreement.



7.21 _Supplemental Disclosure_. Seller shall, not less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, supplement or amend the Schedules provided by
the Seller Entities with respect to (i) the representations and warranties
contained in _Article V_ (including by the creation of new Schedules to the

_however_ , that any supplement or amendment to the Representations Schedules
as to a matter (A) arising on or prior to the date hereof which was required
to have been disclosed herein or (B) arising as a result of a breach of any
covenant or agreement by the Seller Entities contained herein, shall not limit
or affect any claim for breach of the applicable representations or warranties
to which such Schedules relate or qualify any representations or warranties
for the purpose of determining the satisfaction of Purchasers conditions to
Closing under _Section 9.1(a)_ (except that amendments or supplements
permitted by clauses (ii) and (iii) of this _Section 7.21_ shall be effective
for purposes of _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ ). Any supplemental disclosure of matters
arising after the date hereof pursuant to clause (i) and (ii) of this _Section
7.21_ shall not form the basis for any Indemnification Claim pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_ if the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this limitation shall in no way affect any
Indemnification Claim pursuant to any other clause of _Section 10.2_ ,
_Section 10.3_ or _Article XI_.



 

94 7.22 _Additional Bond Related Covenants_.



(a) Prior to the Applicable Time, Seller and each of the Seller

respect to the PCRR Bonds, the IDBs or any of the Bond Documents, including

IN ADDITION TO THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT ARE MADE BY EITHER PARTY TO THE OTHER PURSUANT TO OR BY VIRTUE OF
THE EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY DEED, THE BILL OF SALE, THE
ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT, OR ANY STOCK POWER OR OTHER SELLER
DOCUMENT OR PURCHASER DOCUMENT EFFECTING ANY OF THE TRANSFERS AND ASSUMPTIONS
PROVIDED FOR HEREIN OR BASED ON ANY FAILURE OF ANY SUCH DOCUMENT EXPRESSLY TO
DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, AND ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE EXIST IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH

ARTICLE VIII



COVENANTS REGARDING EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS



8.1 _Employees and Labor/Employment Obligations_. (a) Effective as of the
Applicable Time, Purchaser shall offer to hire (or shall cause an
ERISA Affiliate of Purchaser to offer to hire) all LRFP Employees employed
immediately prior to the Applicable Time and all OAR Employees employed
immediately prior to the Applicable Time, whether or not on family, medical,
or other approved leave of absence. Each such offer shall be for a comparable
job and at a comparable rate of total compensation (including sales commission
arrangements as applicable), as each such employee held immediately prior to
the Applicable Time. __

 



(b) Effective as of the Applicable Time, Purchaser shall offer employment to
each Pulp HQ Employee identified _Schedule 8.1(b)_. Each such offer shall be
for a comparable job and at a comparable rate of total compensation (including
sales commission arrangements as applicable), as each such employee held
immediately prior to the Applicable Time.



(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the employment of the BPP
Employees employed immediately prior to the Applicable Time will not terminate
as a result of the Closing and that, with respect to the bargaining unit BPP
Employees, such employment shall continue to be subject to the Collective
Bargaining Agreement. Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that the
employment service of the BPP Employees employed immediately prior to the
Applicable Time will not be interrupted by the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement. After the Applicable Time, and except as provided in _Section
8.15(f)_ and subject to the provisions of _Section 10.2(a)(ix)_ , Purchaser
shall cause BPP to observe, perform, satisfy and timely comply with all Labor-
related Obligations attributable to BPP (including post-Closing Obligations
with respect to pre-Closing events). Nothing in this _Section 8.1(c)_ is
intended to affect the definition of BPP Agreed HR Liabilities or the parties
respective indemnification rights under this Agreement.



(d) Effective as of the Applicable Time, Purchaser shall either offer to hire
(or shall cause an ERISA Affiliate of Purchaser to offer to hire), or, where
local Law so requires, accept the transfer of, all Foreign Employees set forth
on _Schedule 8.1(d)_. Each such offer shall be for a comparable job and at a
comparable rate of total compensation (including sales commission arrangements
as applicable), as each such employee held immediately prior to the Applicable
Time unless Law requires otherwise. 



 

98 (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to require
Purchaser or any ERISA Affiliate of Purchaser to continue to employ any
Transferring Employee for any period after the Closing, except as may be
provided under the Collective Bargaining Agreement or Law.



8.2 _Vacation_. (a) Seller, LRFP, or OAR, as the case may be, shall be
responsible for the payment of all earned but untaken vacation owed to Pulp
HQ Transferring, LRFP Transferring, and OAR Transferring Employees prior to
the Applicable Time pursuant to the Seller vacation policy then in effect for
such Employees. After the Applicable Time, Purchaser shall provide vacation
to Pulp HQ Transferring, LRFP Transferring, and OAR Transferring Employees in
accordance with vacation policies then in effect for similarly situated
employees of Purchaser (or an ERISA Affiliate of Purchaser).



(b) After the Applicable Time, Purchaser or BPP, as the case may be,
shall recognize the earned but untaken vacation time for salaried and
nonbargaining unit BPP Transferring Employees remaining as of the Closing
under the applicable Seller vacation policy. After the Applicable Time,
Purchaser or BPP, as the case may be, shall provide vacation to salaried and
nonbargaining unit BPP Transferring Employees in accordance with vacation
policies then in effect for similarly situated employees of Purchaser (or an
ERISA Affiliate of Purchaser).



(c) Seller shall be responsible for the payment of all earned but
untaken vacation owed to Foreign Transferring Employees as of the Applicable
Time pursuant to the Seller vacation policy then in effect for such employees.
After the Applicable Time, Purchaser shall provide vacation to Foreign

for similarly situated employees of Purchaser (or an ERISA Affiliate of
Purchaser), unless otherwise required by Law.

dates and rates of accruals under Purchasers vacation policies, Purchaser
shall recognize continuous prior service with Seller, any Seller Affiliate or
the predecessors of any of them immediately prior to the Applicable Time. In
the event any salaried or nonbargaining unit Domestic Transferring Employee,
as of the Applicable Time, would have accrued more weeks of vacation in
calendar year 2004 under the applicable Seller vacation policy than that
provided under the applicable Purchaser policy for comparable
service, Purchaser or BPP, as the case may be, shall allow such Employee to
accrue the greater number weeks vacation through such time that the Employee
becomes eligible to accrue that greater number weeks vacation under the
applicable Purchaser policy. For the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs, Purchaser shall provide Pulp HQ Transferring, LRFP Transferring and
OAR Transferring Employees with unpaid time off equivalent to any earned but
unused vacation time remaining for such year as of the Applicable Time under
the terms of the Seller vacation policy.



8.3 _Leaves of Absence_. Subject to Law, Purchaser shall continue the leave of
any Transferring Employee on approved leave of absence immediately prior to
the Applicable Time



 

99 for such additional period as provided under Purchasers leave policies, plans
or arrangements, counting continuous leave provided by Seller or an ERISA
Affiliate of Seller, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Applicable
Time.

399, (i) Seller and Purchaser shall report earnings information on a
predecessor/successor basis as set forth therein with respect to the Pulp HQ,
LRFP, and OAR Transferring Employees, (ii) Seller shall furnish and file Forms
W-2 and W-3 (and make related tax filings) with respect to earnings of Pulp

filings) with respect to earnings of the Pulp HQ, LRFP, and OAR Transferring
Employees attributable to employment with Purchaser (or a Purchaser Affiliate)
after the Applicable Time. Purchaser shall cause BPP to report and file all
2004 earnings information for, and furnish Forms W-2 and W-3 to, all BPP
Employees and Former BPP Employees with earnings attributable to employment
with BPP at any time during 2004, and Seller shall have no obligations
with respect to payroll tax reporting for BPP for the 2004 tax year.



(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide Purchaser the employment data,
files and related information identified on _Schedule 8.4(b)_ for purposes of
payroll transition of Domestic Transferring Employees. To the extent
feasible, such data, files and information shall be supplied electronically.
The parties shall cooperate with respect to the transfer to minimize the cost
and inconvenience to both parties.



(c) At Sellers request, Purchaser shall cause BPP to (i) pay BPP Employees
and Former BPP Employees compensation earned or otherwise attributable to
employment prior to the Applicable Time but payable after the Applicable Time,
(ii) withhold the appropriate payroll taxes on such compensation consistent
with the withholding practices of BPP on compensation paid prior to the

on the employer with respect to such compensation.



8.5 _Severance Benefits_. From the Applicable Time, through December
31, 2004, Purchaser agrees to pay any salaried or nonbargaining unit hourly
Domestic Transferring Employee whose employment with Purchaser or a Purchaser
Affiliate, as the case may be, ends involuntarily at any time during calendar
year 2004 a lump sum cash payment which is no less favorable than the lump
sum cash payment provided for under Question 6.a. of the Severance Plan. In so
providing, Purchaser shall recognize continuous prior service with Seller, any
ERISA Affiliate of Seller, or the predecessors of any of them prior to the
Applicable Time.



8.6  _Workers  Compensation and Other Employment-related Claims_. The
parties agree to cooperate with respect to the administration of workers
compensation and any other employment-related claims and to make such
witnesses available and provide such information as may reasonably be
required by the other in the administration and/or defense of such claims, to
the extent otherwise permitted by Law.



 

100 8.7 _Seller Incentive Plans_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this _Article VIII_ , Purchaser shall have no Liability for, and Seller shall
remain solely responsible for and retain all Liability in respect of, benefits
accrued or payable under the SVIP, LTIP, LTAP, STIP, Incentive Plan, Gainshare
Plan, Supplemental Plan, and Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the "
_Seller Arrangements_ "). The benefits and rights of Transferring Employees
under the Seller Arrangements shall be governed by the terms of such plans as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing and, after the Closing,
Transferring Employees shall be ineligible to participate in or accrue
additional benefits under the Seller Arrangements.



8.8 _Stock Options; Stock Appreciation Rights; Restricted Shares_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller, in its
sole discretion and at its sole expense, shall have the right to fully or
partially vest and/or extend the exercise period with respect to any option,
stock appreciation right or restricted share held by a Transferring Employee.



8.9 _Bonuses_. (a) Each Transferring Employee who participates in the STIP,
the Gainshare Plan, or the Incentive Plan, as applicable, for the plan year in
which this transaction closes shall be entitled to a prorated benefit to the
extent that the objectives established under such plan are satisfied as of the
Closing, as determined by Seller in its sole discretion. The payment shall be
made by Seller in accordance with the terms of such plan, not later than the
time payments are regularly paid under such plan, and shall be reduced by
applicable withholding taxes and other authorized deductions. Seller shall be
responsible for all employer taxes on such amounts. Purchaser shall have no
Liability for, and Seller shall remain solely responsible for and retain all
Liability in respect of, benefits accrued prior to the Closing under the
STIP, the Gainshare Plan, or the Incentive Plan.

and nonbargaining unit hourly Domestic Transferring Employee who is employed
with Purchaser (or any ERISA Affiliate of Purchaser) through December 31,
2004, and who would have been eligible under Sellers Gainshare Plan,
Purchaser shall establish or maintain a bonus program through December 31,
2004 that is at least as favorable as the bonus opportunity provided under
the Gainshare Plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing. As for those
salaried and nonbargaining unit hourly Domestic Transferring Employees who
would not have been eligible under the Gainshare Plan, each such employee will
be eligible for incentives and bonuses of Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates
to the same extent as are similarly situated employees of Purchaser or
Purchasers Affiliates. As for bargaining unit BPP Transferring Employees,
Purchaser shall pay bonuses under the provisions of the Collective Bargaining

fully vest each Transferring Employee in his or her account balance under
such plan.



(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall amend the Hourly Retirement Plan
to provide that nonbargaining unit Transferring Employees who are participants
in the Hourly Retirement Plan shall be fully vested in their accrued benefit
under the Hourly Retirement Plan.



(d) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall amend the Hourly 401(k) Plan to
fully vest each nonbargaining unit Transferring Employee in his or her account
balance under such plan.



8.11 _Brunswick Plan_. (a) As of the Closing Date, Seller shall amend the
Brunswick Plan and the accompanying trust to substitute the Purchaser as the
sponsor of such plan, and the Purchaser shall assume the Brunswick Plan
effective after the Closing Date.



(b) Each Transferring Employee who participated in the Brunswick Plan prior to
the Closing shall continue to participate in the Brunswick Plan after
the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of such plan. The Brunswick
Plan shall continue to recognize, for all purposes, service earned before the
Closing Date, to the same extent that such service is recognized under the
Brunswick Plan as in effect on the Closing.



(c) The Brunswick Plan, Purchaser, and BPP, as the case may be, shall after
the Closing be solely responsible for all liabilities and obligations of the
Brunswick Plan including, but not limited to, benefits accrued prior to and on
the Closing Date and benefits payable to Brunswick Plan participants who
retired or separated from service prior to such date.



(d) Seller agrees to provide the Purchaser with such information regarding
plan participants as may be reasonably requested and necessary in order to
administer and maintain the Brunswick Plan.



8.12 _Purchaser s 401(k) Plan_. After the Closing, salaried
and nonbargaining unit hourly Domestic Transferring Employees shall be
eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan offered to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser (or any ERISA Affiliate of Purchaser) at that time. For
purposes of vesting rights and eligibility for participation in the such
401(k) Plan, salaried and nonbargaining unit hourly Domestic Transferring
Employees shall receive service credit for their prior continuous service with
Seller, any ERISA Affiliate of Seller, or the predecessors of any of them
prior to the Closing, unless otherwise required by Law.



8.13 _Purchaser s Pension Plan_. After the Closing, salaried and
nonbargaining unit hourly Domestic Transferring Employees shall be eligible to
participate in the Pension Plan offered to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser (or any ERISA Affiliate of Purchaser) at that time. For purposes of
vesting rights and eligibility for participation in such Pension Plan,
salaried and nonbargaining unit hourly Domestic Transferring Employees shall
receive service credit for their prior continuous service with Seller, any
ERISA Affiliate of Seller, or the predecessors of any of them prior to the
Closing, unless otherwise required by Law.



8.14 _Foreign Retirement Benefits_. After the Closing, with respect to the
Foreign Transferring Employees, Purchaser agrees that, insofar as it is able
to provide the same benefits



 

102 through the same or comparable insurance provider at comparable costs, it
shall assume the responsibilities and obligations arising under the
applicable retirement program, if any, then in effect, as set forth in
_Schedule 8.14_ , and shall through December 31, 2004 (or such longer time as
provided by Law) continue these benefits in effect as of the Closing.
Purchaser shall otherwise comply with all Law regarding employee retirement
programs or benefits for the Foreign Employees.



8.15 _Health and Welfare Plans and Fringe Benefits_. (a) Subject to the
provisions of this _Section 8.15(a)_ , after the Closing, each
Domestic Transferring Employee who was a participant in Welfare Plans
maintained by Seller (" _Seller Welfare Plans_ ") immediately prior to the
Closing shall cease to participate in the Seller Welfare Plans and shall
immediately become eligible to participate in the Welfare Plans established
or maintained by Purchaser or an ERISA Affiliate of Purchaser (" _Purchaser
Welfare Plans_ ") in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchaser
Welfare Plans. Any Domestic Transferring Employee who enrolls in the
Purchasers short-term disability plan after the Closing shall be eligible to
receive benefits under that plan after the Closing _provided_ the Domestic
Transferring Employee satisfies the conditions for benefits under such plan
and has satisfied the elimination period specified in the plan during
employment with Seller or an ERISA Affiliate of Seller, as the case may be,
and/or Purchaser or an ERISA Affiliate of Purchaser, as the case may be.
After Closing, all salaried and nonbargaining unit hourly Domestic
Transferring Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Purchaser
Welfare Plans provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or
Purchasers Affiliate immediately prior to the Closing. With respect to
bargaining unit BPP Transferring Employees, such plan shall provide benefits
consistent with the obligations under the Collective Bargaining Agreement as
of the date of this Agreement. The Purchaser Welfare Plans shall waive any
preexisting condition limitations and shall give credit to each Domestic
Transferring Employee toward any deductible, coinsurance, or out-of-pocket
limit under the Purchaser Welfare Plans (except for Long-Term Disability,
where the preexisting condition limitations cannot be waived by Purchaser) for
expenses incurred under any Seller Welfare Plan during the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs, _provided_ that such Transferring Employees
are covered under a substantially equivalent plan immediately prior to the
Closing and _provided_ that Seller, within 60 days after the Closing Date,
provides sufficient information to confirm such expenses. The Purchaser
Welfare Plans shall also, as of the Closing, recognize service credit for
each Domestic Transferring Employees continuous prior service with Seller,
any ERISA Affiliate of Seller, or the predecessors of any of them immediately
prior to Closing for purposes of eligibility to participate in said Purchaser
Welfare Plans.



(b) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 8.15(b)_ , after the Closing
Date, each Foreign Transferring Employee who was a participant in welfare
plans provided by Seller for medical benefits, dental benefits, vision care
benefits, life insurance, or accidental death and dismemberment insurance ("
_Seller Foreign Insurance Benefits_ ") immediately prior to the Closing
provided by Seller, shall cease to participate in the Seller Foreign Insurance
Benefits. From after the Closing Date through December 31, 2004, Purchaser
agrees that it will provide to each Foreign Transferring Employee the
substantially equivalent benefits to those benefits each such Employee was
receiving under the Seller Foreign Insurance Benefit immediately prior to or
on the Closing Date. This Section does not apply to any retiree medical
benefits for which Foreign Transferring Employees may have been eligible from
Seller, and Purchaser makes no agreement with respect to retiree medical
benefits for Foreign Transferring Employees.



 

103 (c) Except as provided in this _Article VIII_ , any claims for Welfare Plan
expenses incurred by Transferring Employees prior to the Closing shall be
covered under the Seller Welfare Plans in accordance with the terms of any
such plan, and Purchaser and the Purchaser Welfare Plans shall have no
Liability for any claims under the Seller Welfare Plans and any expenses
related thereto that are incurred before the Closing. Seller, any ERISA
Affiliate of Seller, and the Seller Welfare Plans shall have no Liability for
any claims under the Purchaser Welfare Plans and any expenses related thereto
that are incurred after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
educational or tuition benefits approved by Seller with respect to courses
which are in progress immediately prior to the Closing shall be payable by
Seller under the terms of its Educational Assistance Policy.



(d) If any party to this Agreement inadvertently pays any welfare benefit
claims that are a Liability of another party to this Agreement, the
responsible party shall reimburse the paying party for all such payments. No
party shall be responsible under this Section to reimburse another party for
welfare benefit claims that are not covered under the respective partys
Welfare Plans



(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 8.15_ , any
Transferring Employee who is in a long-term disability waiting period
immediately prior to the Closing, and who becomes "Disabled" (as defined
under Sellers LTD Plan) after the Closing, shall be entitled to coverage
under the LTD Plan to the extent such employee would otherwise have been
entitled to benefits under the terms of such plan had the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement not occurred.



(f) Seller shall, at its expense, provide retiree medical benefits under the
Seller Plans to the extent required by and in accordance with the Collective
Bargaining Agreement to any bargaining unit Former BPP Employee, any
bargaining unit BPP Employee who does not become a Transferring Employee, or
any bargaining unit BPP Transferring Employee. In each such instance, the
employee must satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth in the
Collective Bargaining Agreement. Seller shall not provide retiree medical
benefits to any bargaining unit BPP Transferring Employee whose employment
with BPP ends after January 1, 2007. With respect to each bargaining unit BPP
Transferring Employee whose employment with BPP ends on or prior to January
1, 2007, Purchaser agrees to provide Seller the Employees retirement date,
the Employees current mailing address, telephone number, age, date or dates
of employment and years of service and such other information as Seller may
reasonably request. Such information shall be provided to Seller not later
than fifteen (15) days after an employee provides Purchaser advance notice of
retirement or, where an employee does not provide advance notice of
retirement, not later than fifteen (15) days after an employees actual
retirement. If Purchaser fails to provide such information within fifteen (15)
days as described in the preceding sentence, then Purchaser agrees to
reimburse Seller for any costs or expenses actually incurred by Seller
(including any reasonable administration costs or expenses) due to Purchasers
failure to timely provide such information. Seller and Purchaser agree to
cooperate in good faith to ensure there is no break in coverage during the
transition from coverage under Purchasers medical plan to enrollment for
retiree medical benefits under Sellers Plans, including distribution of
appropriate notices or forms as Seller reasonably requires.

_Sections 10.3_ or _10.5_ ) or under _Article XI_ (an " _Indemnification
Claim_ "), the indemnified party(ies) shall reasonably and promptly cause
written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of the assertion of such Indemnification
Claim to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. If the Indemnification Claim
is a claim by a Third Person, Transferring Employee or any other employee
hired by Purchaser, BPP or a Designated Affiliate of Purchaser, the
indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party(ies), and to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim; _provided_ that (i) the
indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in writing to the indemnified
party(ies) its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party(ies) as provided
hereunder, subject only to the



 

114 express limitations on such obligations hereunder or (ii) the indemnifying
party shall have agreed, subject to the limitations hereunder, to bear the
reasonable Expenses of one separate counsel to the indemnified party(ies) who
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim. If the
indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with such Indemnification Claim, it shall, within six (6) months after
receiving notice from the indemnified party(ies) of the assertion of such
claim by a Third Person, Transferring Employee or any other employee hired by
Purchaser, BPP or a Designated Affiliate of Purchaser, notify the indemnified
party(ies) of its intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification
Claim, defers its election during such six month period, or otherwise fails
to notify the indemnified party(ies) of its election to so defend as herein
provided (and until so notified by the indemnifying party of the indemnifying
partys election to so defend), the indemnified party(ies) may defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim with separate counsel at its own
expense; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the indemnifying party has
reasonably and promptly after receipt of a Claim Notice given notice to the
indemnified party(ies) that it is so deferring its election to defend, the
counsel for the indemnified party(ies) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any
Indemnification Claim at any time, the indemnified party(ies) may participate,
at its own expense, in the defense of such Indemnification Claim; _provided_
, _however_ , that such indemnified party(ies) shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party if the claim by a Third Person, Transferring Employee or
any other employee hired by Purchaser, BPP or a Designated Affiliate of
Purchaser that is the subject of the Indemnification Claim is asserted against
both the indemnified and indemnifying parties, the indemnified party(ies)
advises the indemnifying party that it has or they have concluded in good
faith that the interests of the indemnified party(ies) and the indemnifying
party in connection with the matter that is the subject of such Third Person
claim are so materially in conflict that a single counsel could not
effectively represent the interests of all such parties in the defense
thereof, and a mutually selected independent counsel advises the parties in
writing that a single counsel could not effectively represent such interests;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be required
to pay for more than one such counsel for all indemnified parties in
connection with any Indemnification Claim. Each of the parties shall pay one
half of the fees and expenses of any such independent counsel. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 10.4_ to the contrary, neither the indemnifying
party nor the indemnified party(ies) shall, without the written consent of
the other party (which shall not be unreasonably be withheld or delayed),
settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or permit a default or consent
to entry of any judgment unless the claimant and such party provide to such
other party an unqualified release from all Liability in respect of the
Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any
Indemnification Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified
party(ies) to any insurance benefits or other claims of the indemnified
party(ies) with respect to such Indemnification Claim. Each party also agrees
to cooperate with each other in the defense, negotiation or settlement of any
Indemnification Claim by a Third Person, Transferring Employee or any other
employee hired by Purchaser, BPP or a Designated Affiliate of Purchaser,
including making available to the party defending such Indemnification Claim
(x) its personnel to provide depositions, testimony or other assistance and
(y) documents or other physical



 

115 evidence within its control or custody. This _Section 10.4(a)_ shall relate to
Indemnification Claims relating to (i) Environmental Costs and Liabilities
only to the extent the matters covered by this Section are not addressed in
_Section 7.10_ or _10.3_ or (ii) Taxes only to the extent the matters covered
by this Section are not addressed in  _Section 11.4_ , which sections shall
govern with respect to any matters covered thereby.



(b) After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in
which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the indemnified party(ies) and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a
mutually binding agreement with respect to an Indemnification Claim hereunder,
the indemnified party(ies) shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of
any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall be required to
pay all of the sums so due and owing to the indemnified party(ies) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days after
the date of such notice.



(c) The failure of the indemnified party(ies) to give reasonably prompt notice
of any Indemnification Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
indemnifying partys obligations with respect thereto except to the
extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice
as a result of such failure and except that such failure shall not increase or
expand the Survival Periods.



10.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_.



(a) An indemnifying party shall not have any Liability under:



(i) _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 10.2(b)(i)_ hereof for any Losses with
respect to the breach of any:



(A) General Survival Representations unless and until the aggregate amount of
all such Losses exceeds an amount equal to $6,000,000 (the " _General
Deductible_ "), after which and, in such event, the indemnifying party shall,
subject to the provisions of _Section 10.5(b)_ , be required to pay all
Losses in excess of the General Deductible;



(B) Title/Validity Representations unless and until the aggregate amount of
all such Losses exceeds an amount equal to $2,000,000 (the " _Title/Validity
Deductible_ "), after which and, in such event, the indemnifying party shall,
subject to the provisions of _Section 10.5(b)_ , be required to pay all Losses
in excess of the Title/Validity Deductible; and 



(C) Miscellaneous Extended Representations and _Section 5.13_ unless and
until the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds an amount equal to
$2,000,000 (the " _Miscellaneous Deductible_ ," together with the General
Deductible and the Title/Validity Deductible, collectively the "
_Representation Deductibles_ "), after which and, in such event, the
indemnifying party shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 10.5(b)_ , be
required to pay all Losses in excess of the Miscellaneous Deductible;



 

116 (ii) _Section 10.2(a)(ix)_ hereof for any Losses with respect to any of
the Liabilities described in clauses (ii) and (v) of BPP Indemnified
Liabilities or in _Sections 2.4(f)_ and _2.4(g)_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds an amount equal to $2,000,000 (the "
_Pre-Closing Business Deductible_ "), after which and, in such event, the
indemnifying party shall be required to pay all Losses in excess of the Pre-
Closing Business Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Pre-
Closing Business Deductible nor any other Deductibles contained in this
Agreement shall apply to any Losses arising out of, relating to or based upon
any Indemnification Claim involving (A) any BPP Excluded Employee, (B) any
LRFP Employee or OAR Employee that does not become a Transferring Employee
and any Former LRFP Employees and Former OAR Employees and (C) any Employee
(whether or not the Employee is a Former Employee or Transferring Employee)
for retiree medical benefits under any Seller Welfare Plan or the Collective
Bargaining Agreement; and



(iii)  _Section 10.2(a)(vii)_ hereof for any BPP Retained Contract Warranty
Losses and Transferred Contract Warranty Losses unless and until the aggregate
amount of such Losses exceeds an amount equal to $310,000 (the " _Product
Warranty Deductible_ ," together with the Pre-Closing Business Deductible and
the Representation Deductibles, collectively the " _Deductibles_ "), after
which and, in such event, the indemnifying party shall be required to pay all
Losses in excess of the Product Warranty Deductible.



For the avoidance of doubt, the Deductibles described above shall be mutually
exclusive, shall only apply to the matters pertaining to the applicable
Deductible and Losses for any individual matters shall not reduce the
availability of more than one Deductible; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that upon
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, incurring aggregate Losses subject to the Deductibles equal to
$6,000,000 (the " _Global Deductible_ "), the Seller Entities or Purchaser,
as applicable, shall be obligated to pay all Losses in excess of the Global
Deductible irrespective of whether the individual Deductibles have been met
for the applicable matter.



(b) Neither the Seller Entities nor Purchaser shall be required to
indemnify any Person under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or _10.2(b)(i)_ ,
respectively, for an aggregate amount of Losses exceeding an amount equal to
$225,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ") in connection with Losses related to the failure
of any of the Real Property Title Representation, the Title/Validity
Representations, the Miscellaneous Extended Representations, the General
Survival Representations or _Section 5.13_.



(c) To the extent there is a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, for purposes of calculating the amount of any
Losses to be indemnified pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or _10.2(b)(i)_ (and
not for purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred), any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations
and warranties shall be ignored.



 

117 (d) For the avoidance of doubt:



(i) Neither the Deductibles nor the Cap shall apply to any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to  _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or _10.2(b)(i)_ with
respect to any breach of the Perpetual Representations and the Statute of
Limitations Representations (other than _Section 5.13_ ); and



(ii) the Deductibles shall not apply to any claim for indemnification made
pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements, _Sections 10.2(a)(ii)-(vi)_ and _(viii)_
, _10.2(b)(ii)-(vi)_ , _10.3_ and _Article XI_ ; and



(iii) the Cap shall not apply to any claim for indemnification made pursuant
to the Ancillary Agreements,  _Sections 10.2(a)(ii)-(ix)_ ,
_10.2(b)(ii)-(vi)_ , _10.3_ and _Article XI_.



10.6 _Acknowledgements; Exclusive Remedies; Extraordinary Damages_. (a) The
parties acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing their sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, including statutory or other claims arising under
Environmental Laws (other than any claim of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in  _Articles X_ and _XI_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall limit the rights of either party to seek and obtain injunctive
relief in accordance with _Section 12.2_ or limit any remedies available to
any party under the Ancillary Agreements, the Pre-Closing Side Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement or the Parent Side Agreement. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the parties hereto hereby waive and release from and after the
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action (other than any claim of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation) with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement they
may have against the other parties, their respective Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in _Articles X_ and _XI_ and pursuant to
the Ancillary Agreements, the Pre-Closing Side Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement or the Parent Side Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser and Seller shall have the right to seek any remedy available at law
or in equity with respect to the breach of any of the provisions of _Section
7.7_.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
provided for under any Law, no Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party shall be entitled hereunder (including under _Article X_ or
_Article XI_ hereof) to any Extraordinary Damages, except to the extent such
Extraordinary Damages (i) are included in any Order in favor of a Person other
than a Third Person, Transferring Employee or any other employee hired by
Purchaser, BPP or a Designated Affiliate of Purchaser after the Closing
arising from a Legal Proceeding (or settlement thereof) brought or threatened
against a Purchaser Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party or (ii)
arise out of or relate to any breach of  _Section 7.7_.



10.7 _Mitigation_. Purchaser and Seller shall each use their commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses subject to indemnification
hereunder, to the extent mitigation is required under Law.



 

118 ARTICLE XI



TAXES



11.1 _Tax Indemnification_. (a)Each of the Seller Entities, jointly and
severally, hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all Losses in respect
of (i) all Taxes imposed on the Business, the Seller Entities, BPP, the
Transferred Assets, the BPP Retained Assets, the Excluded Assets or the BPP
Excluded Assets (A) for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date, and (B) for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date (determined as provided below); (ii) the failure by the Seller Entities
to perform any covenant contained in this Agreement with respect to Taxes;
(iii) all Taxes imposed on any member of an Affiliated Group of which BPP is
or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, by reason of the Liability of
BPP pursuant to Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.1502-6 (or any analogous provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law); (iv) payments under any Tax allocation,
sharing or similar agreement (whether oral or written) to which Seller or any
of its Affiliates is a party; (v) the assignment of any of the Seller
Entities rights under this Agreement to a "qualified intermediary" pursuant
to _Section 7.20_ ; and (vi) the portion of all Taxes relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on or prior to the
Closing for which the Seller Entities are liable pursuant to _Section 11.5_.



(b) Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Seller Indemnified
Parties harmless from and against any and all Losses in respect of (i) all
Taxes imposed on BPP or the Transferred Assets (A) for any taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date, and (B) for the portion of any Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date (determined as provided below); (ii)
the failure by Purchaser or BPP (after Closing) to perform any post-closing
covenant contained in this Agreement with respect to Taxes; and (iii) the
portion of all Taxes relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for which Purchaser is liable pursuant to _Section 11.5_.



(c) Each of the Seller Entities jointly and severally agrees from and after
the Closing to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties from and against all ad valorem taxes and any and all other general
or specific taxes, assessments or governmental charges, levied or assessed
against, with respect to, or that may become a Lien upon, the Leaf River Mill
Lease, the Leaf River Pollution Control Facilities Lease or any of the real
property leased or subleased pursuant to either the Leaf River Mill Lease or
the Leaf River Pollution Control Facilities Lease or any portion thereof, and
any fine, penalty, interest or cost that may be added thereto (collectively,
the " _Bond Property Ad Valorem Taxes_ ") due and payable with respect to any
period prior to the Closing Date.



 

11.2 _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.



(a) Subject to _Section 11.3(b)_ , Seller shall timely file or cause to be
timely filed all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect
to BPP or the Transferred Assets (i) on or before the Closing Date and (ii)
after the Closing Date to the extent such Returns relate solely to taxable
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and, in each case, shall timely
remit all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice. Seller shall
also timely file or cause to be



 

119 filed all Affiliated Group Tax Returns that include or relate to BPP or the
Transferred Assets and shall timely remit all Taxes due in respect of such
Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns, to the extent they relate to BPP or the
Transferred Assets, shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice. Seller shall provide Purchaser with copies of the portions of
such completed Tax Returns relating specifically to BPP or the Transferred
Assets at least 20 days prior to the due date for filing thereof (or such
lesser time as is reasonable in the case of monthly filings), along with
supporting workpapers, for Purchasers review and approval, if and to the
extent Purchaser or BPP is liable hereunder for the payment of Taxes pursuant
thereto. Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing. In
the event that Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with
respect to such Tax Return at least 10 days prior to the due date for filing,
such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to _Section 11.6_ , which resolution
shall be binding on the parties.



(b) Subject to _Section 11.3(b)_ , following the Closing, Purchaser shall
cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by BPP (other
than those described in _Section 11.2(a)_ above) and, subject to the rights to
payment from Seller hereunder, pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due
thereon. Upon Closing, Seller shall provide Purchaser a list of all Tax
Returns due by BPP within sixty (60) days after Closing. Purchaser shall
provide Seller with a copy of any such completed Tax Return with respect to
which Purchaser claims Seller owes any Taxes pursuant to _Section 11.1_ at
least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing thereof (or such
lesser time as is reasonable in the case of monthly filings), along with
supporting workpapers and a schedule showing the portion of the Taxes payable
pursuant to such Tax Returns that Purchaser has calculated are payable by
Seller pursuant to _Section 11.1_ , for Sellers review and approval. Seller
and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements
regarding such Tax Return or the allocation of Taxes thereunder prior to the
day which is ten days before the due date for filing such Tax Return. In the
event that Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with
respect to such Tax Return or allocation at least 10 days prior to the due
date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to _Section 11.6_ ,
which resolution shall be binding on the parties.



(c) Not later than 5 Business Days prior to the due date for the payment of
Taxes on any Tax Returns which Purchaser has the responsibility to cause to be
filed pursuant to _Section 11.2(b)_ , Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount
of Taxes, as determined in accordance with _Section 11.2(b)_ , owed by Seller
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 11.1_. No payment pursuant to this
_Section 11.2(c)_ shall excuse Seller from its indemnification obligations
pursuant to _Section 11.1_ if the amount of Taxes as ultimately determined
(on audit or otherwise) for the periods covered by such Tax Returns exceeds
the amount of Sellers payment under this _Section 11.2(c)_ ; nor shall any
such payment constitute a waiver by Seller of the right to
obtain reimbursement of all or any portion of such payment if the amount of
such Taxes owed by Seller as so ultimately determined is less than the amount
paid by Seller, and in such event Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Seller
for the amount of Sellers overpayment.



11.3 _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_.



(a) Seller and Purchaser will, unless prohibited by Law, close the taxable
period of BPP as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If Law does not
permit BPP to close its taxable year on the Closing Date or in any case in
which a Tax is assessed with respect



 

120 to a taxable period which includes the Closing Date (but does not begin or end
on that day) (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the Taxes, if any, attributable to a
Straddle Period shall be allocated (i) to Seller for the period up to and
including the close of business on the Closing Date, and (ii) to Purchaser for
the period subsequent to the Closing Date. Any allocation of income or
deductions required to determine any Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period
shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of BPP as of the
close of the Closing Date, _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the
number of days in each such period.



(b) All real property taxes, personal property taxes, or ad valorem
obligations and similar recurring taxes and fees on the Transferred Assets for
taxable periods beginning before, and ending after, the Closing Date, shall be
prorated to the extent not reflected in Final Working Capital between
Purchaser and Seller as of the close of business on the Closing Date. With
respect to Taxes described in this _Section 11.3(b)_ , Seller shall timely
file all Tax Returns due on or before the Closing Date with respect to such
Taxes and Purchaser shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns due after
the Closing Date with respect to such Taxes. If one party remits to the
appropriate Taxing Authority payment for Taxes, which are subject to proration
under this  _Section 11.3_ and such payment includes the other partys share
of such Taxes, such other party shall promptly reimburse the remitting party
for its share of such Taxes.



11.4 _Tax Audits_.



(a) If notice of any Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to BPP or
the Transferred Assets (a " _Tax Claim_ ") shall be received by either party
for which the other party may reasonably be expected to be liable pursuant to
_Section 11.1_ , the notified party shall promptly inform such other party in
writing of such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the
notified party to give the other party notice as provided herein shall not
relieve such failing party of its obligations under _Section 11.1_ except to
the extent that the other party is actually and materially
prejudiced thereby.



(b) Seller shall have the right, at its expense to represent the interests of
the Seller Entities or BPP in any Tax Claim relating exclusively to taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) Seller shall allow Purchaser and its counsel to participate in any Legal
Proceeding at Purchasers sole expense; (ii) Seller shall keep Purchaser fully
and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any
such Legal Proceeding; (iii) if the results of any such Legal Proceeding
involve an issue that recurs in taxable periods ending after the Closing Date
or otherwise could adversely affect Purchaser, BPP or their Affiliates for any
taxable period ending after the Closing Date, then Seller and Purchaser
shall jointly control the defense and settlement of any such Legal Proceeding
and each party shall cooperate with the other party at its own expense, and
there shall be no settlement or closing or other agreement with respect
thereto without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; and (iv) if Seller does not elect to represent the
Seller Entities or BPPs interests in any such Legal Proceeding, then
Purchaser, BPP or any of their Affiliates may pay, compromise or contest such
asserted Tax Claim with Sellers written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.



 

121 (c) Purchaser shall represent, at its expense, the interests of BPP in any Tax
Claim relating to a Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
Purchaser shall allow Seller and its counsel to participate in any Legal
Proceeding at Sellers sole expense; (ii) Purchaser shall keep Seller fully
and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of
such Legal Proceeding; and (iii) if the results of any such Legal Proceeding
involve an issue which is the subject of indemnification by Seller pursuant to
_Section 11.1_ , then Purchaser and Seller shall jointly control the defense
and settlement of any such Legal Proceeding and each party shall cooperate
with the other party at its own expense, and there shall be no settlement or
closing or other agreement with respect thereto without the consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.



11.5 _Transfer Taxes_. Seller and Purchaser shall each pay one-half of all
sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording, transfer or similar fees or
taxes or governmental charges as levied by any Governmental Body (including
any interest and penalties) in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Seller shall pay 100% of
any such Transfer Taxes incurred as a result of any transactions pursuant to
_Section 7.20_ unless such Transfer Taxes would have been incurred regardless
of whether Seller exercised its rights under _Section 7.20_ and (b) Seller
shall pay 100% of any such Transfer Taxes incurred as a result of any
transactions pursuant to  _Section 7.11_.



11.6 _Disputes_. Any dispute as to any matter covered by this _Article XI_
shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to
Seller and Purchaser. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be
borne equally by Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser on the other. If any
dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date of
such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which the party
responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems correct. 



11.7 _Time Limits_. Any claim for indemnity under  _Section 11.1_ may be made
at any time prior to 90 days after the expiration of the applicable Tax
statute of limitations with respect to the relevant taxable period (including
all periods of extension, whether automatic of permissive). 



11.8 _Exclusivity_. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
_Article XI_ , on the one hand, and the provisions of _Article X_ , on the
other, the provisions of this _Article XI_ shall control.



11.9 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The parties agree to treat all payments
made under _Articles III_ , _X_  and _XI_ as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes. If, notwithstanding the treatment required by the
preceding sentence, any indemnification payment is determined to be taxable to
the party receiving such payment by any Taxing Authority, the paying party
shall also indemnify the party receiving such payment for any Taxes incurred
by reason of the receipt of such payment and any Expenses incurred by the
party receiving such payment in connection with such Taxes (or any asserted
deficiency, claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, judgment or assessment,
including the defense or settlement thereof, relating to such Taxes).



11.10 _Tax Sharing_. Any Tax allocation, indemnity, or similar agreement or
arrangement between Seller and its Affiliates on the one hand, and BPP, on
the other hand, shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date and will have no
further effect for any taxable year (whether the current year, a future year
or a past year).



 

122 11.11 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.



(a) Purchaser and Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to BPP
Stock or the Transferred Assets as is reasonably necessary for the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return, claim for refund or other required or optional
filings relating to Tax matters, for the preparation for any Tax audit, for
the preparation for any Tax protest, for the prosecution or defense of any
suit or other proceeding relating to Tax matters.



(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall retain possession of all
accounting, business, financial and Tax records and information relating
to BPP or the Transferred Assets that are in existence on the Closing Date
and transferred to Purchaser hereunder for the greater of seven (7) years or
the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions). Purchaser
shall give Seller notice and an opportunity to retain any such records in the
event that Purchaser determines to destroy or dispose of them after such
period. In addition, from and after the Closing Date, each of Purchaser and
Seller shall provide access to the other party (after reasonably detailed
prior notice and during normal business hours), to the books, records,
documents and other information relating to BPP or the Transferred Assets in
such partys possession as is reasonably necessary for such other party to
properly prepare for, file, prove, answer, prosecute and/or defend any Tax
Return, claim, filing, tax audit, tax protest, suit, proceeding or answer.



 

11.12 _Tax Clearance Certificates_. At Purchasers request, which shall be
delivered to Seller not later than ten (10) days after the execution of this
Agreement, Seller shall notify all of the Taxing Authorities for the
jurisdictions set forth on _Schedule 5.8(c)_ of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in the form and manner required by such Taxing
Authorities, if the failure to make such notifications or receive any
available tax clearance certificate (" _Tax Clearance Certificate_ ") could
subject Purchaser to any Taxes of Seller. If, in respect to any application
for Tax Clearances made pursuant to this _Section 11.12_ , any Governmental
Body asserts that Seller is liable for any Tax, Seller shall promptly pay any
and all such amounts and shall provide evidence to Purchaser that such
liabilities have been paid in full or otherwise satisfied.



11.13 _Carry Back of Losses_. Other than as required by Law, Purchaser agrees
that it shall not, and shall not cause or permit BPP to, carry back to any
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date any net operating loss,
loss from operations or other Tax attribute relating to the Business and
further agrees that Seller has no obligation under this Agreement to return or
remit any refund or other Tax benefit attributable to a breach by Purchaser of
the foregoing undertaking.



11.14 _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refunds that are received by Purchaser, BPP, or
any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing, and any amounts credited
or offset against Taxes of Purchaser, BPP, or any of their respective
Affiliates after the Closing that are actually realized by such parties, other
than any refunds, credits or offsets resulting from a carryback of losses not



 

123 prohibited by _Section 11.13_ , that in each case relate to any taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, shall be for the account of Seller.
The amount of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of the Business that
are received by Seller or any of its Affiliates, or by Purchaser, BPP or any
of their respective Affiliates, after the Closing that relate to taxable
periods ending after the Closing Date, and any refunds, credits or offsets
resulting from a carryback of losses not prohibited by _Section 11.13_ , shall
be for the account of Purchaser. The amount or economic benefit of
any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of the Business for any taxable
period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date shall be equitably
apportioned between Seller and Purchaser. Each party shall forward, and shall
cause its Affiliates to forward, to the party entitled to receive the amount
or economic benefit of a refund, credit or offset to Tax, net of any Taxes
payable with respect thereto, the amount of such refund, or the economic
benefit of such credit or offset of Tax within fifteen (15) days after
receipt or actual realization thereof.



11.15 _Transaction Reporting_. With respect to BPP, Seller and Purchaser agree
to report all transactions not in the Ordinary Course of Business (other than
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement) undertaken or caused to
be undertaken by Purchaser occurring on the Closing Date but after the
Closing on Purchasers Tax Returns to the extent permitted by Treasury Reg.
Sec. 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (and its counterpart, if any, under state, local
or foreign Law). Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement to
the contrary, Purchaser agrees to indemnify Seller for any additional Tax owed
by Seller resulting from any transaction engaged in by BPP undertaken or
caused to be undertaken by Purchaser not in the Ordinary Course of Business
occurring on the Closing Date but after Closing.



ARTICLE XII



MISCELLANEOUS 



12.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, each of the Seller Entities, on one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand, shall bear their own expenses incurred in connection with
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other
agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.



12.2 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Seller Entities, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, acknowledge and agree that the breach of this
Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the other and such other
party(ies) will not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the obligations
of each party under this Agreement, including the Seller Entities obligation
to sell the BPP Stock and the Transferred Assets to Purchaser, shall be
enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by the Agreed Court,
and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection
therewith. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such remedies
shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to
any other remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.



 

124 12.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of
Jury Trial_.

 



(a) The parties agree that any dispute, controversy or claim regarding the
interpretation or validity of, or otherwise arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement (including the existence, validity, interpretation or breach
hereof and any claim based on contract, tort or statute) shall be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in the
State of Delaware (the " _Agreed Court_ "), and the parties hereby agree to
submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such Agreed
Court and not to seek transfer of any case or proceeding out of such Agreed
Court. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of any such dispute brought in such Agreed Court or any defense of
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.



(b) Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any controversy that may
arise under this Agreement or any Seller Document or Purchaser Document is
likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and, therefore, each such
party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any right such party may have to trial by jury in respect to
any Legal Proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under, or in
connection with or relating to this Agreement or any Seller Document or
Purchaser Document. Each party hereto certifies and acknowledges that (i) no
representative, agent, or attorney of any other party hereto has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of such
Legal Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each such party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) each
such party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each such party has been
induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this _Section 12.3_.



(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by the delivery of a
copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 12.6_.



12.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (including
the schedules and exhibits hereto), the Parent Side Agreement, the Pre-Closing
Side Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 14, 2003, between
Seller and Koch Equity Development LLC, as heretofore or hereafter amended
and supplemented (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and the other Seller
Documents and Purchaser Documents to be executed and delivered (and to only
then become effective) herewith or at Closing represent the entire
understanding and agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, and any and all prior representations and warranties, both
written and oral, among or between any of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate at Closing and be of no further force and effect, except that it
shall survive the Closing with respect to any breaches thereof prior to the
Closing solely with respect to Seller Confidential Information. This Agreement
can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be
waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to
this Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such
amendment, supplement,



 

125 modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy. Except as expressly provided herein, all remedies hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by Law.



12.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute, controversy or claim
regarding the interpretation or validity of, or other issue arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and
performed in such State, without regard to principles of choice of law thereof
(other than New York General Obligations Law § 5-1401).



12.6  _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered personally by
hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (ii) when sent by facsimile (with
written confirmation of transmission) or (iii) one business day following the
day sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt), in each
case at the following addresses and facsimile numbers (or to such other

12.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.



12.8 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. Except as provided in _Articles X_ and
_XI_ with respect to the indemnification of indemnified parties hereunder,
nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Person not a party to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in _Articles X_ or _XI_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement to the contrary, the rights of any third party beneficiary under
such Articles may be affected by and shall be subject at all times to the
terms of any amendments, supplements, modifications and waivers entered into
by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 12.4_. Except as
contemplated by _Section 7.20_ , no assignment of this Agreement or of any
rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any Seller Entity or Purchaser
(by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without such required
consent shall be void and unenforceable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (a)
any Seller Entity may assign this Agreement and any or all rights or
obligations hereunder (i) prior to the Closing to any Designated Affiliate of
Seller and (ii) subsequent to Closing to any Person and (b) Purchaser
may assign this Agreement and any or all rights or obligations hereunder
(including Purchasers rights to purchase the BPP Stock or any of the
Transferred Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities and Purchasers and
BPPs rights to seek indemnification hereunder) (i) to any Designated
Affiliate(s) of Purchaser, (ii) to any Person from which it has



 

127 borrowed money as security for obligations to such lender in respect of the
financing arrangements entered into in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and any refinancings, extensions, refundings or renewals
thereof; (iii) subsequent to the Closing, to any Person to whom Purchaser
transfers one or more of the Mills and any related assets;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Seller Entities shall not thereafter be required to deal
with such assignee hereunder, but will continue to be entitled to deal solely
with Purchaser and that no such assignment shall result in any expansion or
reduction of the Seller Entities Liabilities under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement or require any Seller Entity, or Affiliates or
Representatives thereof to incur any Liability or Loss not otherwise agreed to
hereunder or (iv) subsequent to the Closing, to any Person to which Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates sells all or substantially all of the Transferred
Assets and BPP Retained Assets and which executes a written assumption of all
of Purchasers liabilities and obligations hereunder in favor of the Seller
Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for an assignment under clause
(b)(i) of the third sentence of this _Section 12.8_ , the obligations of the
Seller Entities under _Sections 10.3(b)(i)(A)_ and _(B)_ shall not be
assignable under any circumstances, by operation of law or otherwise, directly
or indirectly, without Sellers prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any party assigning this Agreement or any
of its rights hereunder prior or subsequent to Closing shall remain
responsible for all of its liabilities and obligations hereunder. Subject to
the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this
Agreement to Purchaser or to the Seller Entities, as applicable, shall also
apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.



12.9 _Non-Recourse_. Except to the extent such Person is a signatory hereto,
to the Seller Documents, to the Purchaser Documents, to the Pre-Closing Side
Agreement or to the Parent Side Agreement (and then only to the extent
provided herein or therein), no past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of the Seller Entities, Purchaser or their
respective Affiliates shall have any Liability under this Agreement or any of
the Seller Documents or Purchaser Documents of or for any claim based on, in
respect of, related to, arising from, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.



12.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement.
