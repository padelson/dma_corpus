Closing Statement") setting forth the Seller's good faith estimate of: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tthe Closing Working Capital;

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe Estimated Closing Statement shall also include instructions that
identify (A) the bank account for the Seller and the amount of the Closing
Payment to be paid to such bank account at the Closing and (B) the bank
accounts designated to facilitate direct payment by the Buyer of the Closing
Indebtedness and the Closing Transaction Costs, in each case as set forth in
the Estimated Closing Statement, to the applicable payees on behalf of the
Company Entities. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared and
calculated using the applicable definitions contained in this Agreement, in
accordance with the Accounting Principles and in the same format as the Sample
Calculation. The Seller will review any comments proposed by the Buyer with
respect to the Estimated Closing Statement, and will consider, in good faith,
any appropriate changes; provided that the Seller shall not be required to
make any changes proposed by the Buyer that it does not deem appropriate and
in the event of any disagreement between the Seller and the Buyer prior to the
Closing with respect to the Estimated Closing Statement, the Closing Amounts
provided by the Seller in the Estimated Closing Statement shall be used for
calculating the Closing Payment. At the request of the Buyer, the Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with and assist, and shall cause the Company Entities and
each of their respective Representatives to reasonably cooperate with

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-4-  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

and assist, the Buyer and its Representatives in the review of the Estimated
Closing Statement (including by taking actions as may be reasonably required
to cause the Seller and the Company Entities and their respective accountants
to deliver to the Seller and its Representatives copies of their work papers
relating to the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement) and provide
the Buyer and its Representatives with any information reasonably requested by
the Buyer that is necessary for its review of the Estimated Closing Statement;
provided that any such review conducted by the Buyer shall not delay the
Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tAs soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing,
but in any event no later than 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer will
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Seller an unaudited
statement (the "Closing Statement"), setting forth the Buyer's good faith
calculation of each of the Closing Amounts and the Closing Payment. The
Closing Statement shall be prepared and calculated using the applicable
definitions contained in this Agreement, in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and in the same format as the Sample Calculation. In the event
that the Buyer does not deliver the Closing Statement during such 90-day
period, the Closing Amounts set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement shall
be deemed final and binding and no Purchase Price Adjustment shall be payable. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tUpon receipt from the Buyer, the Seller shall have 45
days to review the Closing Statement (the "Review Period"). At the request of
the Seller, the Buyer shall: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\treasonably cooperate with and assist, and shall cause
the Company Entities and each of their respective Representatives to
reasonably cooperate with and assist, the Seller and its Representatives in
the review of the Closing Statement (including by taking actions as may be
reasonably required to cause the Buyer and the Company Entities and their
respective accountants to deliver to the Seller and its Representatives copies
of their work papers relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement);
and 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tprovide the Seller and its Representatives with any
information reasonably requested by the Seller that is necessary for its
review of the Closing Statement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf the Seller disagrees with the Buyer's computation of the Closing
Amounts (each as set forth in the Closing Statement), the Seller shall, on or
prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a written notice to the
Buyer (the "Notice of Objection") that sets forth the Seller's objections to
the Buyer's calculation of the Closing Amounts, as applicable. Any Notice of
Objection shall specify those items or amounts with which the Seller disagrees
and shall set forth the Seller's calculation of the Closing Amounts and the
Closing Payment based on such objections.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tIf the Seller does not deliver a Notice of Objection to
the Buyer with respect to an item contained in the Closing Statement within
the Review Period, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Buyer's
calculation of such item in the Closing Statement, and such calculation shall
be final, conclusive and binding. If the Seller delivers a Notice of
Objection to the Buyer within the Review Period, the Buyer and the Seller
shall, during the 30 days following such delivery or any mutually agreed
extension thereof, use their good faith efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items and amounts in order to determine the amount of the disputed
Closing Amounts, as applicable, and the Closing Payment. If, at the end of
such 30-day period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, the Buyer and the
Seller are unable to resolve their

disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements to the
Chicago office of Grant Thornton, LLP, or if such Person refuses such
engagement or is no longer independent, a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Seller (the
"Independent Expert"), which shall act as an expert in accounting and not as
an arbitrator. The Buyer and the Seller shall instruct the Independent Expert
promptly to review this Section 2.4, as well as the Closing Statement, Notice
of Objection and any other materials reasonably requested by the Independent
Expert, and to determine, solely with respect to the disputed items and
amounts so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the Closing Amounts
set forth in the Closing Statement require adjustment. The Independent Expert
shall base its determination solely on written submissions by the Buyer and
the Seller and the terms of this Agreement and not on an independent review.
The Parties shall make available to the Independent Expert all relevant books
and records and other items reasonably requested by the Independent Expert.
As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 45 days after its
retention, the Independent Expert shall deliver to the Buyer and the Seller a
report that sets forth its resolution of the disputed items and amounts and
its calculation of the Closing Amounts; provided, however, that the
Independent Expert may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Seller, on the other hand, nor less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand. The
decision of the Independent Expert shall be final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties, and no determinations by the Independent Expert, including any
work or analyses performed by the Independent Expert in connection with its
resolution of any dispute under this Section 2.4(d), shall be admissible as
evidence in any Proceeding among the Parties, except to the extent necessary
to enforce payment obligations under this Section 2.4. The costs and expenses
of the Independent Expert shall be allocated between the Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the
portion of the aggregate contested amount not awarded to such Party bears to
the aggregate amount actually contested by such Party, as determined by the
Independent Expert. For example, if (i) the Seller submits a Notice of
Objection for $1,000, (ii) the Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed
by the Seller, and (iii) the Independent Expert ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding the Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Independent Expert would be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to
the Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Seller. The Buyer and the Seller
agree to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a reasonable
engagement letter, including customary indemnities in favor of the Independent
Expert.

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tNotwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the
Seller notifies the Buyer in writing that any amounts otherwise due to the
Seller pursuant to Section 2.4(f)(i) or Section 2.4(f)(ii) are to be paid to
Employees, (A) the Seller shall pay such amounts to the Buyer, (B) the Buyer

 \t\t\t\t Section 2.5 \t\t\tWithholding. The Buyer and the Company will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement (including payments of purchase price) such amounts as the Buyer or
the Company (or any Affiliate thereof) are required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other
provision of applicable Laws; provided that there shall be no withholding on
account of U.S. federal income Taxes on payments to the Seller so long as the
Seller complies with the provisions of Section 2.3(b)(ii) of this Agreement,
unless such withholding is required as a result of a change in Law after the
date of this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the Buyer or
the Company is required to deduct or withhold from any amount payable pursuant
to this Agreement (other than payments of wages or other compensation for
services), the Buyer or the Company, as applicable, will use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the Seller with at least three Business Days'
notice of its determination that is required to make such deduction or
withholding and shall cooperate with the Seller to reduce or eliminate such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Buyer or the Company, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding were made.

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tThe Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare
and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, (x) all Tax
Returns with respect to any Seller Affiliated Group (such Tax Returns, the
"Company Consolidated Tax Returns"), (y) all Tax Returns with respect to the
Company Entities that are required to be filed on or prior to the Closing
Date, and (z) all separate Income Tax Returns of any Company Entity (other
than Company Consolidated Tax Returns) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other
than a Straddle Period) (collectively, the Tax Returns described in clauses
(y) and (z), the "Seller-Filed Tax Returns"). All Seller-Filed Tax Returns
that are not Income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice, except as otherwise required by Law, and without a change of
any election or any accounting method of any Company Entity. The Seller shall
provide a draft of each Seller-Filed Tax Return to be filed after the Closing
Date to the Buyer for its review and comment, along with any relevant
accompanying schedules, documents and work papers prepared by the Seller, at
least 30 days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax
Returns. The Seller shall incorporate all timely and reasonable comments of
the Buyer into such Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date received in
writing within ten days following receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Buyer shall cause the applicable Company Entity to file all such Seller-Filed
Tax Returns prepared by the Seller and timely delivered to the Buyer in
accordance with this Section 5.8. The Seller shall pay to the Buyer an amount
equal to any Indemnified Taxes shown as due and payable on any Seller-Filed
Tax Return to be filed by the Buyer at least five days prior to the date on

timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns of each Company
Entity due after the Closing Date that are not Seller-Filed Tax Returns or
Company Consolidated Tax Returns (each, a "Buyer-Filed Tax Return"). To the
extent a Buyer-Filed Tax Return relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, it shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with the Company Entities' past practice
and without a change of any election or any accounting method of any Company
Entity, except in each case as otherwise required by applicable Law. The
Buyer shall provide a draft of each Buyer-Filed Tax Return that is an Income
Tax Return (or pro forma returns in the case of a Straddle Period) to the
Seller for its review and comment, along with any relevant accompanying
schedules, documents and work papers, at least 30 days prior to the due date
(including extensions) of such Tax Returns, and shall provide a draft of any
other Buyer-Filed Tax Return that was not prepared consistently with past
practices as a result of not being in compliance with applicable Law to the
Seller within a reasonable time prior to the due date of such Tax Return. The
Buyer shall incorporate all timely and reasonable comments of the Seller into
such Tax Returns and schedules. The Seller shall pay to the Buyer an amount
equal to any Indemnified Taxes shown as due and payable on any Buyer-Filed Tax
Return by the later of (A) ten Business Days after receiving notice of such
Taxes and (B) five days prior to the date on which such Taxes are due and
payable by the Buyer or the applicable Company Entity.

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tCooperation. The Parties shall, and shall each cause
their respective Affiliates to, provide to the other Party such cooperation
and information, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with
preparing, reviewing and filing of any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim
for refund, determining liabilities for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes,
or in conducting any audit or other action with respect to Taxes, with respect
to the Company Entities and relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each
case, at the expense of the requesting Party. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of all relevant portions of
relevant Tax Returns, together with relevant accompanying schedules and
relevant work papers and documents relating to rulings and other
determinations by Governmental Entities relating to Taxes, and relevant
records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property, that any such
Party may possess. Each Party will retain all Tax Returns, schedules, work
papers, material records and other documents relating to Tax matters of the
Company Entities for the Tax period first ending after the Closing Date and
for all prior Tax periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notice is provided with
respect thereto, any extensions thereof) for the Tax periods to which the Tax
Returns and other documents relate and (ii) eight years following the due date
(without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such eight-year period, the
Party holding such Tax Returns or other documents may dispose of them. Each
Party shall make its employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any documents or information so
provided. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer reserves the right to
report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the Taxing
authorities of the People's Republic of China pursuant to Announcement 7
within thirty days of the date of this Agreement, at its sole expense, and the
Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer in any such filings.

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tStraddle Periods. If a Company Entity is permitted, but
not required, under applicable foreign, state or local Tax Laws to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, such day shall be treated as
the last day of a taxable period. For all purposes of this Agreement,
including and for purposes of calculating the Closing Amounts: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tExcept as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
Taxes for a taxable period including but not ending on the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period") with respect to the Company Entities shall be apportioned
between the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the portion
of the period commencing on the day immediately following the Closing Date,
based on the actual operations of the Company Entities, as the case may be, by
a closing of the books of the Company Entities, as if the Closing Date were
the end of a Tax year, and each such portion of such period shall be deemed to
be a taxable period (whether or not it is in fact a taxable period). For
purposes of computing the Taxes attributable to the two portions of a taxable
period pursuant to this Section 5.8(c), the amount of any item that is taken
into account only once for each taxable period (e.g., the benefit of graduated
Tax rates, exemption amounts, etc.) shall be allocated between the two
portions of the period in proportion to the number of days in each such
portion.

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tIn the case of any property Taxes or other similar
Taxes imposed on a periodic basis that are payable during the Straddle Period,
the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such taxable period
ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on (and including) the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable
period. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tIn the case of Taxes imposed on any Company Entity,
the Buyer, or any Buyer Indemnitees as a result of income of any Flow-Thru
Entity realized prior to the Closing Date (such income being computed assuming
the Flow-Thru Entity had a year that ends on the Closing Date and closed its
books), such Taxes shall be treated as Taxes of the applicable Company Entity
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iv) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, (A)
Transaction Tax Deductions, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (B) any Taxes attributable to
any action taken by the Buyer or any Company Entity on or after the Closing
that is not in the ordinary course of business shall be allocated to the
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date.

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tSubject to Section 5.8(d)(iii), to the extent not taken
into account in calculating the Closing Amounts, the Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Company Entities to, pay the Seller the amount of any cash Tax

Entity employing such individual, or to otherwise terminate the employment of
such individuals with the Company Entity, and Seller shall be solely

purposes of the foregoing, (i) a medical or dental claim shall be considered
incurred when the medical services are rendered or medical supplies are

retention bonuses) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Closing; and 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\temployee benefits that are substantially equivalent in

situated employees of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer; provided that, this
Section 5.11(c)(iii) shall not apply to any equity or phantom equity, change
in control bonuses, retention bonuses or severance benefits.

Continuing Employees.

plan maintained by the Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller
401(k) Plans") the Buyer's tax-qualified defined contribution plan or plans
with a cash or deferred feature (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan"). As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, the Seller 401(k) Plans shall, to the
extent permitted by Section 401(k)(10) of the Code, make distributions
available to the applicable Continuing Employees, and the Buyer 401(k) Plan
shall accept any such distribution (including loans) as a rollover
contribution if so directed by such Continuing Employees.

Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller FSA Plan") of the
Continuing Employees will be transferred to one or more comparable plans of
the Buyer or its Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer FSA Plan");

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tAs of, and after Closing, the Buyer and its Affiliates
shall provide credit to each Continuing Employee for vesting, eligibility and,

purposes under the benefit plans of the Buyer or its Affiliates (as
applicable) providing benefits to Continuing Employees after the Closing for
such Continuing Employee's service prior to the Closing with the Seller or any
of its Affiliates (and their respective predecessors) to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any
similar Seller Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan prior to Closing;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service.

shall cause the Continuing Employees to be subject to, and commence to accrue
benefits under, the vacation, sick leave and other personal time off policies
of the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer applicable to the respective
Continuing Employees. To the extent it is required under applicable Law that,
in connection with the Transactions, the Seller or any Company Entity make a
payment to any Continuing Employees with respect to his or her unused
vacation, personal days or sick days related to the pre-Closing period, the
Seller shall be responsible for such payment and the Buyer and its Affiliates

providing for deferred compensation, including in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B).

or following the Closing Date, such payments and the employer Taxes related
thereto shall be taken into account in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital and the Buyer shall remit such payments to the applicable Continuing
Employees.

Party as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, and the Buyer shall not,
and shall cause the Company Entities not to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party; provided, however, that all rights
to exculpation, indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance coverage
in respect of any Proceedings pending or asserted or any claim made within
such period shall continue until the disposition of such Proceeding or
resolution of such claim. From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause
the Company Entities to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each

control their respective insurance policies and self-insurance programs,
including the right to negotiate, exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back
or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of such insurance policies
and self-insurance programs, and the Seller and its Affiliates shall retain

aware; (iii) of the receipt of any notice or other communication from any
party to the Debt Financing Commitment with respect to any actual expiration,

Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, cause, solicit, induce or encourage any Continuing Employee to
leave his or her employment with a Company Entity and shall not hire any such
Continuing Employee from a Company Entity; provided, however, that the
foregoing restriction shall not restrict the Seller (i) from placing

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tThe covenants and undertakings contained in this Section
5.18(g) relate to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary

cause irreparable injury to the Buyer, the amount of which will be impossible
to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated.
Therefore, the Buyer will be entitled to seek an injunction, restraining order
or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the
event of any breach of this Section 5.18(g), in each case without the posting
of bond or other security. The rights and remedies provided by this Section

receiving such funds may not withhold them for the account of the other party
in the event there is a dispute regarding any other issue under this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement.

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tFrom the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date,
the Seller shall (i) keep the Buyer apprised of updates regarding the Merial
Lawsuits from time to time as requested by the Buyer, (ii) coordinate with the
Buyer with respect to the management of the Merial Lawsuits; provided that

shall indemnify the Seller and its Affiliates to the extent the Seller or its
Affiliates suffer any Losses that arise from any litigation resulting from the
sale by Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) of inventory
with Perrigo Marks, provided that the Seller is not in breach of any of its
representations or warranties in respect of such inventory.

shall be true and correct with respect to Registered Intellectual Property
registered or applied for worldwide as of the date on which such updated

under Section 5.3, Section 5.5, Section 5.15, this Section 7.2 and Article
IX under this Agreement; provided, however, that termination pursuant to
Section 7.1 shall not relieve a breaching Party (whether or not the

willful breach of this Agreement, unless, with respect to a termination
pursuant to Section 7.1(g), the Parties have expressly waived such defaulting
or breaching Party from any liability resulting from any such willful breach.

that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (i) except as
provided in Section 7.2(c), under no circumstances will the Seller and its
Affiliates, in the aggregate, be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the
amount of the Termination Fee and (ii) in no event shall the Buyer be required
to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Upon payment of the
Termination Fee, the Termination Fee will be the Seller's and its Affiliates'
sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against the Buyer and its Affiliates and the Financing Source for
any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement or
the failure of the Transactions to be consummated and the Buyer and its
Affiliates and the Financing Source shall have no further liability relating

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tThe Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the Transactions and
that without these agreements, the Seller would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Buyer fails to promptly pay or cause to be paid the
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.2, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Seller commences a Proceeding that results in a judgment against
the Buyer for the Termination Fee, the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to
the Seller its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) in connection with such Proceeding, together with interest on the
amount due pursuant to this Section 7.2 from the date such Termination Fee was
required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made. Each of the Buyer and the Seller acknowledges and agrees
that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but constitutes liquidated damages
in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Seller in the specified
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable.

 \t\t\t\t Section 8.4 \t\t\tIndemnification Procedure for Third-Party
Claims. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tIn the event that any claim or demand, or other
circumstance or state of facts that could give rise to any claim or demand,
for which an Indemnitor may be liable to an Indemnitee under this Agreement,
is asserted or sought to be collected by a Person or Governmental Entity who
is not a Party or an Affiliate thereof (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnitee
shall notify the Indemnitor in writing of such Third-Party Claim (a "Notice of
Claim") as promptly as practicable; provided, however, that a failure or
delay by an Indemnitee to provide a Notice of Claim as promptly as practicable
shall not affect the rights or obligations of such Indemnitee unless the
Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure or delay.
The Notice of Claim shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly
accrued Losses or anticipates that it will incur liability for Losses for
which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement, and (ii) specify in reasonable detail, as applicable and to the
extent known, each individual item of Loss included in the amount so stated,
the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis for any anticipated
Loss and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of
covenant or claim to which each such item is related and the computation of
the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled under this
Agreement. The Indemnitee shall enclose with the Notice of Claim a copy of
all papers served with respect to such Third-Party Claim, if any, and any
other documents evidencing such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnitee will
reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in determining the validity of
any claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such
matters. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThe Indemnitor shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third-Party Claim and
any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice (which counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee) and at its sole cost and
expense (a "Third-Party Defense") by providing written notice of such
assumption to the Indemnitee within 60 days following delivery of the Notice
of Claim. If the Indemnitor assumes the Third-Party Defense in accordance
with this Agreement, (i) the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its
sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim,
but the Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and settlement
thereof, (ii) the Indemnitee will not file any papers or consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor and (iii) the
Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim (A) to the extent such
judgment or settlement provides for equitable or injunctive relief without the
prior written consent of the Indemnitee, (B) if such settlement does not
include as a term thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such claim to
the Indemnitee a release from all liability with respect to such claim
underlying such judgment or settlement or (C) if such settlement or judgment
contains any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on
behalf of the Indemnitee. The Parties will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize Losses from Third-Party Claims and will act in good faith
in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such
claims. The Parties will also cooperate in any such defense and give each
other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto.

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tIf the Indemnitor does not assume the Third-Party
Defense, the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume the Third-Party Defense, at
its sole cost and expense (or, if the Indemnitee incurs a Loss with respect to
the matter in question for which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, as applicable, at the expense of the
Indemnitor), upon delivery of notice to such effect to the Indemnitor;
provided, however, that (i) the Indemnitor shall have the right to
participate in the Third-Party Defense at its sole cost and expense, but the
Indemnitee shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof,
and (ii) the Indemnitee shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the
consent of the Indemnitor if such judgment or settlement imposes any financial
or other obligation or Liability on the Indemnitor. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not
have the right to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, if (i) the
claim seeks only an injunction or other equitable relief, (ii) the Indemnitee
shall have been advised by counsel that there are one or more legal or
equitable defenses available to them which are different from or in addition
to those available to the Indemnitor, and, in the reasonable opinion of the
Indemnitee, counsel for the Indemnitor could not adequately represent the
interests of the Indemnitee because such interests could be in conflict with
those of the Indemnitor, (iii) such Third-Party Claim involves, or could have
a material effect on, any material matter beyond the scope of the
indemnification obligation of the Indemnitor, (iv) the Indemnitor shall not
have assumed the defense of such Third-Party Claim in a timely fashion, or (v)
the Third-Party Claim involves a criminal matter. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tTo the extent there is any conflict between this Section
8.4 and Section 5.8(e) as relates to a Tax Claim, the provisions of Section
5.8(e) shall control.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t Section 8.5 \t\t\tIndemnification Procedures for Non-Third-Party
Claims. The Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor in writing as promptly as
practicable following its discovery of any matter, circumstance or state of
facts for which the Indemnitee may seek indemnification pursuant to this
Article VIII that does not involve a Third-Party Claim. Such notice shall (a)
state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates
that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) specify in reasonable
detail, as applicable and to the extent known, each individual item of Loss
included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly
accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which
each such item is related and the computation of the amount to which such
Indemnitee claims to be entitled under this Agreement; provided, however,
that a failure or delay by an Indemnitee to provide such notice as promptly as
practicable shall not affect the rights or obligations of such Indemnitee
unless the Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure
or delay. The Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitor
in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and
in otherwise resolving such matters.

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tEach Indemnitee shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue and collect on any recovery available under any insurance
policies; provided, that the availability of such insurance shall not preclude
a claim or recovery on a timely basis against an Indemnitor. The

amount of Losses payable under this Article VIII by the Indemnitor shall be
reduced by any and all amounts recovered by the Indemnitee under applicable
insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor
(net of all costs and expenses associated with the recovery thereof, including
any insurance premium increases or loss of coverage resulting therefrom, with
respect to insurance policies other than the RandW Policy). If the Indemnitee
receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses subsequent to an
indemnification payment by the Indemnitor, then such Indemnitee shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnitor for any payment made or expense incurred by such
Indemnitor in connection with providing such indemnification up to the amount
received by the Indemnitee, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnitee in
collecting such amount. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tEach Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable under this Agreement.

applicable Tax purposes.

exhaustion of remedies) first against the Buyer or to join the Buyer in any
enforcement action or to first resort to any other means of obtaining payment
