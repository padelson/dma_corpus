set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other party thereto under any of
the Debt Financing Commitments, (ii) constitute a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
or any other party thereto under the Debt Financing Commitments or (iii) result in any portion of the Debt Financing Commitments
being unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments applicable to it will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing
will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date, nor to the knowledge of Parent, does Parent have any reason to believe
that any of the Debt Financing Sources will not perform its respective funding obligations with respect to the Debt Financing
under the Debt Financing Commitments. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Financing Commitments,
Parent and Merger Sub will have on the Closing Date funds sufficient to (i) pay the Closing Payments and the other payments under
Article III, (ii) pay any and all of the fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company
in connection with the Merger and the Debt Financing, (iii) pay for any refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitments, and (iv) satisfy all of the other
payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company contemplated hereunder. Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms
that it is not a condition to the Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement that Parent or Merger Sub obtain
the Debt Financing or any other financing for or related to any of the transactions contemplated hereby.</U></FONT></P>

of this <U>Section 9.3</U>, the term &ldquo;Willful Breach&rdquo; means a party&rsquo;s knowing and intentional material breach
of any of its representations or warranties as set forth in this Agreement, or such party&rsquo;s material breach of any of its
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement, which material breach constitutes, or is a consequence of, a purposeful
act or failure to act by such party with the knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act would cause a material
breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a failure by Parent and Merger Sub to close in accordance with this Agreement
when they are obligated to do so, the inability of Parent to make any of the payments contemplated by this Agreement (including
the payments contemplated by <U>Article II</U>) and/or the failure to obtain any financing necessary to make such payments shall
be deemed to be a Willful Breach.</FONT></P>

of the Closing, any and all rights and benefits conferred upon it by the provisions of any Law with respect to the Released Claims
hereinabove specified and expressly consents to this release being given full force and effect according to each and all of its

State of California and (2) expressly waives any rights or benefits under Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California
and any similar provisions of applicable law of any other jurisdiction. Section 1542 states: &ldquo;A general release does not
extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which
