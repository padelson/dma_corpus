questions and receive answers relating to the preparation of the Closing
Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants and
advisers of Parent or the Surviving Company shall not be obligated to make
any working papers or personnel available to Seller unless and until
Seller has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement
relating to such access to working papers and advisers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants or advisers. Seller
shall notify Parent in writing (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") prior to
the expiration of the Review Period if Seller disagrees with the Closing
Statement or the Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash or Company
Transaction Expenses set forth therein. The Notice of Disagreement shall set
forth in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement, the amounts
involved and Seller's determination of the amount of the Working Capital,
Funded Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses, in each case, as
of the Adjustment Time with reasonably detailed supporting documentation. Any
amount (or component thereof) contained in the Closing Statement and not
specifically disputed in a timely delivered Notice of Disagreement shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties with respect to such item for
all purposes hereunder.

  



  

(c) During the 30 days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement (the " _Dispute Resolution Period_ "), Seller and Parent
shall seek in good faith to resolve any disagreement that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If no Notice
of Disagreement is received by Parent on or prior to the expiration date of
the Review Period, then the Closing Statement and the Working Capital, Funded
Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing
Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller and shall become
final and binding upon Parent and Seller. If the parties cannot agree on the
Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses
during the Dispute Resolution Period, the Working Capital, Funded
Indebtedness, Cash and/or Company Transaction Expenses, in each case solely
to the extent not agreed between Seller and Parent, shall be submitted to a
boutique specialty firm with a nationally recognized and active practice area
focused on post-mergers and acquisitions purchase price dispute resolution
mutually agreed by Parent and Seller in good faith or, in the absence of such
agreement within five days after the end of the Dispute Resolution Period, as
selected by lot from up to three firms proposed by each of Seller and Parent
(the " _Independent Arbitrator_ "). Seller and Parent shall each enter into a
customary engagement letter with the Independent Arbitrator. Seller and Parent
shall furnish the Independent Arbitrator with a statement setting forth the
items from the Notice of Disagreement which are still in dispute (the "
_Independent Arbitrator Dispute Notice_ ") and the position, including the
specific amount proposed, of each of Seller and Parent with respect to each
such disputed item. Within 60 Business Days after the submission of such
matters to the

  



    

18

 

    

Independent Arbitrator, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Independent
Arbitrator, acting as an arbitrator and not as an expert, will, applying the
Company Accounting Principles to the calculation of Net Working Capital and
otherwise in a manner consistent with the Sample Calculations with respect to
the calculation of Working Capital (to the extent the Sample Calculations are
in accordance with the Company Accounting Principles) and the definitions of
Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses,
make a determination of the appropriate amount of each of the line items in
the Closing Statement as to which there is disagreement as specified in the
Independent Arbitrator Dispute Notice, which determination shall be final,
conclusive and binding on Seller and Parent, absent Fraud, bad faith or
manifest error. The parties agree that no party (nor any of its
Representatives) shall have any _ex parte_ communications with the
Independent Arbitrator. With respect to each disputed line item, such
determination, if not in accordance with the position of either Seller or
Parent, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the
amounts advocated by Seller or Parent in the Independent Arbitrator Dispute
Notice with respect to such disputed line item (and Parent shall not advocate
for any positions more adverse to Seller than the amounts reflected in the
Closing Statement and Seller shall not advocate for any positions more
adverse to Parent than the amounts reflected in the Notice of
Disagreement). With respect to each disputed line item, the difference
between the respective positions will be divided into three equal
segments. If the Independent Arbitrator's determination of the appropriate
amount for such line item is within a segment closer to one of the advocated
positions, such closer advocated position will be deemed to be the appropriate
amount. If the Independent Arbitrator's determination of the appropriate
amount for such line item is in the middle segment, the Independent
Arbitrator's determination in this regard will be adopted. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Independent Arbitrator shall not review any line items or make
any determination with respect to any matter other than those matters in the
Independent Arbitrator Dispute Notice that are in dispute. The statement of
each of Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction
Expenses as of the Adjustment Time that are final, conclusive and binding on
Seller and Parent, as determined either through agreement of Seller and
Parent (deemed or otherwise) or through the determination of the Independent
Arbitrator pursuant to this _Section 3.5(c) _ are referred to herein as the "
_Final Working Capital Amount_ ," " _Final Funded Indebtedness_ ," " _Final
Cash_ " and " _Final Company Transaction Expenses_ ," respectively. During the
review by the Independent Arbitrator, Seller and Parent shall each make
available (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
respective independent accountants to make available) to the Independent
Arbitrator such party's personnel and such information, books, records and
work papers, as may be reasonably required by the Independent Arbitrator to
fulfill its obligations under this _Section 3.5(c)_ ; _provided_ , _however_
, that the independent accountants of Seller or Parent shall not be obligated
to make any working papers available to the Independent Arbitrator unless and
until the Independent Arbitrator has signed a customary confidentiality and
hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

  



  

(d) The cost of the Independent Arbitrator's review and determination
shall be borne on a proportionate basis by Parent, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other (whose share shall be paid by Seller from the Escrow
Funds), based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded in favor of each such Person bears to the amount

  



    

19

 

    

actually contested by such Person. By way of illustration, if Parent's
calculations would have resulted in a $1,000,000 net payment to Parent, and
Seller's calculations would have resulted in a $1,000,000 net payment to
Seller and the Independent Arbitrator's final determination as adopted
pursuant to _Section 3.5(c)_ results in an aggregate net payment of $500,000
to Seller, then Parent and Seller (whose share shall be paid from the Escrow
Funds) shall pay 75% and 25%, respectively, of such fees and expenses.

  



  

(e) The " _Final Merger Consideration_ " shall be calculated by
recalculating the Estimated Merger Consideration using the Final Working
Capital Amount in lieu of the Estimated Working Capital Amount, using the
Final Funded Indebtedness in lieu of Estimated Funded Indebtedness, using
Final Cash in lieu of Estimated Cash, using the Final Company Transaction
Expenses in lieu of Estimated Company Transaction Expenses and otherwise
using the components of Estimated Merger Consideration as set forth in the
definition of Estimated Merger Consideration.

  



  

(i) If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Merger
Consideration paid at the Closing (such amount, the " _Deficiency Amount_ "),
Parent shall be paid by wire transfer of same day funds promptly (but in any
event within five Business Days after the Final Working Capital Amount, Final
Funded Indebtedness, Final Cash and Final Company Transaction Expenses
have been agreed upon (through deemed agreement or otherwise) or determined
by the Independent Arbitrator, in either case in accordance with _Section
3.5(c)_ , such Deficiency Amount from the Escrow Account; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent's sole recourse with respect thereto shall be the
Escrow Funds held by the Escrow Agent.

  



  

(ii) If the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated
Merger Consideration paid at the Closing (such amount, the " _Excess Amount_
"), Parent shall pay to Seller by wire transfer of same day funds promptly
(but in any event within five Business Days after the Final Working Capital
Amount, Final Funded Indebtedness, Final Cash and Final Company Transaction
Expenses have been agreed (through deemed agreement or otherwise) or
determined by the Independent Arbitrator, in either case in accordance with
_Section 3.5(c)_ , the lesser of the Excess Amount and the amount of the
Escrow Funds.

  



  

(iii) If any Escrow Funds remain in the Escrow Account after the
payment of the Deficiency Amount (or upon payment of the lesser of the Excess
Amount and the amount of the Escrow Funds if there is no Deficiency Amount)
(such amount, the " _Remaining Amount_ "), then Parent, Seller and the
Surviving Company acknowledge and agree that any such Remaining Amount shall
be automatically paid to Seller by the Escrow Agent without any further
action of any parties hereto.

  



  

Parent and Seller hereby agree to deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to deliver promptly from
the Escrow Account all funds to be delivered in accordance with this _Section
3.5(e)_.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Company Accounting Principles_. The Estimated Closing Statement
(including the Estimated Working Capital Amount, Estimated Funded
Indebtedness, Estimated

  



    

20

 

    

Cash and Estimated Company Transaction Expenses), the Closing Statement
(including the Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash and Company
Transaction Expenses) and the Final Merger Consideration shall be prepared
and calculated in accordance with the definitions of such terms contained
in this Agreement and, with respect to the calculation of Estimated Working
Capital and Working Capital, the Company Accounting Principles, except that
the Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Statement (and all
calculations set forth in each, including the calculation of the Estimated
Merger Consideration and the Final Merger Consideration) shall be based on
facts and circumstances as they exist up to the Adjustment Time (and
assuming, and giving effect to, the consummation of the Merger with respect to
the determination of the Company Transaction Expenses) and shall exclude the
effect of any act, decision or event occurring after the Adjustment Time
(other than such assumption as described).

  



  

Section 3.7 _Escrow_. In accordance with _Section 3.2(b)(ii)_ , Parent shall,
on behalf of Seller, deliver to CitiBank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent"), as agent
to Parent and Seller, the Escrow Funds, which Escrow Funds shall be held by
the Escrow Agent in an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") pursuant
to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement and used for purposes of any
payments payable to Parent or Seller pursuant to _Section 3.5_.

  



  

Section 3.8 _Closing Deliverables_.

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Seller or the Company, as applicable,
shall deliver to Parent the following:

  



  

(i) the Escrow Agreement, duly executed by Seller and the Escrow Agent;

  



  

(ii) evidence (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent)
of the termination, effective upon the Closing, of all Affiliate
Contracts pursuant to _Section 7.10_ ;

  



  

(iii) if requested by Parent at least five Business Days prior to the
Closing, executed letters of resignation from each officer and director or
manager (as applicable) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent);

  



  

(iv) the Payoff Letters and the Redemption Notices, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent (which shall be delivered in accordance
with _Section 3.4_ (Funded Indebtedness); and

  



  

(v) the Seller Written Consent and Investor Consents.

  



  

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the Company the
Escrow Agreement, duly executed by Parent and the Escrow Agent.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Withholding_. Parent, its Affiliates, the Escrow Agent and,
effective upon the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable to
Seller pursuant to this Agreement such amounts

  



    

21

 

    

as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If
any amount is so withheld and paid over to the proper Tax Authority, such
withheld and deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to Seller.

  



  

Article IV 
  
  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY_

  



  

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as of the date hereof and as

Section 4.1 _Organization and Power_. The Company is a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the State of Delaware, and the Company has all limited liability company
power and authority to own, operate and lease the properties and assets owned,
operated or leased by it and to carry on its business in all material
respects as currently conducted, and is duly qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign entity, and is in good standing as such, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or licensed
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or be in good standing would not have, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

 _Section 4.2 __Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement; No Breach_ _. _

  



  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each
other agreement, document, instrument or certificate contemplated by this

contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements have been, and
will be at the Closing, duly and validly authorized by all requisite limited
liability company action on the part of the Company or any of its
equityholders, and, other than obtaining the Seller Written Consent and the
Investor Consents, no other proceedings on the Company's or any of its
equityholders' part are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including the Merger). The Seller Written
Consent and the Investor Consents are the only Consents or approvals of the
holders of Company Securities necessary under the DLLCA, the Company's
Organizational Documents or otherwise to approve this Agreement, the other
Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby

Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization or moratorium laws, other similar laws affecting

creditors' rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability
of specific performance and other equitable remedies (the "
_Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

  



  

(b) Except (i) as set forth on Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or (ii) as required under the HSR Act and for the FCA Approval, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement do not and will
not conflict with or result in any breach of, constitute a default under,
result in a violation of, result in the creation of any Lien upon any
properties, rights or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, accelerate
or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
of the Company or its Subsidiaries' obligations or the loss of any benefit
(including any release from escrow or disclosure of proprietary source code),
or require any authorization, consent, waiver, authorization, registration,
filing, notice, approval, exemption or other action by or notice to any
court, other Governmental Body or other third party (" _Consent_ "), under

to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject other than as would

the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Section 4.3(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, equity

the Company Disclosure Schedule, each Subsidiary of the Company is wholly

Section 4.4 _Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities._

  



  

(a) Section 4.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i)
the Seller's audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 (the
" _Latest Audited Balance Sheet_ ") and December 31, 2016, and related audited
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in
members' equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2017 and December 31, 2016 of Seller and its Subsidiaries (all such financial
statements, the " _Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) Seller's unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2018, and the related
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (the "
_Interim Financial Statements_ "). The Financial Statements and Interim
Financial Statements each present fairly, in all material respects and in
conformity with GAAP, the consolidated financial position, cash flows and
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole)
as of the times and for the periods referred to therein and were prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of the Interim Financial
Statements, subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments, the effect
of which would not be material). All accounts and notes receivable and other
receivables arising from or otherwise relating to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date are valid, genuine and fully
collectible in the aggregate amount thereof, in all material respects.

  



  

(b) None of the Company, Infinity Acquisition, LLC or Ipreo Holdings
LLC has any material Liabilities. No Subsidiary of Ipreo Holdings LLC has any
Liabilities, other than Liabilities (i) to the extent reflected in and
reserved against in the Latest Audited Balance Sheet or otherwise to the

Section 4.5 _Absence of Certain Developments._

  



  

(a) Since the Reference Date, there has not been a Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on Section 4.5 or Section 7.1 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and except as expressly required by this Agreement, since
the Reference Date the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have conducted
their business in the ordinary course (including with respect to keeping
intact their respective businesses, preserving their relationships with, and
goodwill of, customers, suppliers, lenders and other Persons with which they
have significant business relationships, making capital expenditures and
managing their working capital (including the timing and collection of
accounts receivable and the payment of accounts payable)). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, since the

  



    

25

 

    

Reference Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action or omitted to take any action which, had such action or omission
occurred after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, would have
required the consent of Parent pursuant to Section _7.1_ (other than pursuant
to _Sections 7.1(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ ).

  



  

Section 4.6 _Title to Properties._

  



  

(a) Except as set forth on Section 4.6(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company or its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or
holds pursuant to valid and enforceable leases, all of the properties and
assets, real and personal, tangible or intangible shown to be owned or leased
by such entity on the Latest Audited Balance Sheet and the Interim Financial
Statements or that are otherwise material to the operation of their business
as currently conducted, free and clear of all Liens (except for
Permitted Liens), and except to the extent that the failure to so own or hold
such property would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The tangible
properties and assets owned or leased by the Company and its Company
Subsidiaries constitute all of the property and assets used or held for use in
connection with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and are
sufficient (and in a condition suitable) to conduct such business
as currently conducted, except in each case, as would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

(b) The real property demised by the leases described on Section 4.6(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Leased Real Property_ ", and such
leases, the " _Leased Real Property Leases_ ") constitutes all of the real
property leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries with annual lease payments
in excess of $250,000. The Company has made available to Parent complete and
accurate copies of each of the Leased Real Property Leases, and none of such
leases have been modified in any material respect, except to the extent that
such modifications are disclosed by the copies made available to Parent.
Except as set forth on Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Leased Real Property Leases are in full force and effect, and the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries holds a valid and existing leasehold interest under
each such lease, subject to proper authorization and execution of such lease
by the other party and the application of any bankruptcy or creditor's
rights laws. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in default beyond any applicable notice and cure periods
in any material respect under any of such leases. Except as set forth on
Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any of the Company's Subsidiaries has subleased, licensed or otherwise granted
any Person the right to use or occupy such Leased Real Property or any
portion thereof.

  



  

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any real
property.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Tax Matters._

  



  

(a) Except as set forth on Section 4.7 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, all income and other material Tax Returns of the Company and
its Subsidiaries required to be filed have been properly and timely filed
(taking into account any applicable extensions), and

  



    

26

 

    

all such Tax Returns were true, correct and complete in all material
respects. All income and other material Taxes required to be paid by or on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries have either been paid in full or
are duly provided for in accordance with GAAP. There are no Liens for Taxes
on the Membership Interests or on any of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than Permitted Liens). All material Taxes required to
be withheld and paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been withheld
and paid in full to the proper Tax Authority. As of the date hereof, (i) there
are no pending audits or Actions or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened audits or Actions relating to any material Tax of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) no written notice of an audit by a Tax Authority has
been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which audit has not
been finally resolved, closed, settled and paid in full, and (ii) there are no
assessments or deficiencies for any material Tax that have been asserted or
made in writing against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that have not
been finally settled and paid in full. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
of the Company has waived any statute of limitations in respect of
any material Tax or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any
material Tax assessment or deficiency, in each case, which period (after
giving effect to such waiver or extension) has not yet expired, and no request
for any such waiver or extension is currently pending other than as a result
of any extension pursuant to an extension to file any Tax Return.

  



  

(b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has
participated in any "reportable transaction" (other than a
"loss transaction") within the meaning of Treasury Regulations section
1.6011-4. Section 4.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
entity classification of the Company and each Subsidiary for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and lists all check-the-box and similar entity
classification elections made with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
for all U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

  



  

(c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company will be
required to include any material item of income in, or exclude any
material item of deduction from, taxable income for any Post-Closing Tax
Period as a result of any (i) closing agreement or settlement with a Tax
Authority executed before the Closing, (ii) prepaid amounts or advanced
billings received before the Closing, (iii) installment sale or open
transaction disposition made before the Closing, (iv) an election pursuant to
Section 108(i) of the Code made before the Closing or (v) change in method of
accounting pursuant to Section 481 of the Code (or any analogous provision of

not a condition to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this
Agreement that Parent or Merger Sub obtains financing for or related to any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Debt Financing.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete
and correct copies of the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date
hereof, between IHS Markit Ltd., HSBC Bank, National Association and HSBC
Securities (USA) Inc. (including all exhibits, schedules, and annexes thereto,

expenses and the refinancing of certain outstanding Indebtedness of the
Company. None of the Debt Financing Commitments has been amended or modified

flex provisions in such fee letters do not permit the imposition of any
new conditions (or the modification or expansion of any existing conditions)

Financing) and customary engagement letters with respect to the Debt Financing
(none of which adversely affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability,

party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Debt

in connection with the Debt Financing Commitments that are payable on or
prior to the date hereof and Parent will, directly or indirectly, continue to
pay in full any such amounts required to be paid as and when they become due
and payable on or prior to the Closing Date. The Debt Financing Commitments
are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, to the
knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each of the other parties thereto. There
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of
the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as 

  



    

42

 

    

 _expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments delivered to the
Company prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other
party thereto under any of the Debt Financing Commitments, (ii) constitute a
failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub or any other party thereto under the Debt Financing Commitments or (iii)
result in any portion of the Debt Financing Commitments being unavailable on
the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that
any of the conditions to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments applicable to it will not be satisfied or that the Debt
Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date, nor to
the knowledge of Parent, does Parent have any reason to believe that any of
the Debt Financing Sources will not perform its respective funding obligations
with respect to the Debt Financing under the Debt Financing Commitments.
Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Financing
Commitments, Parent and Merger Sub will have on the Closing Date funds
sufficient to (i) pay the Closing Payments and the other payments
under Article III, (ii) pay any and all of the fees and expenses required to
be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company in connection with
the Merger and the Debt Financing, (iii) pay for any refinancing of any
outstanding Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitments, and (iv)
satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Company contemplated hereunder. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing or any of its other
obligations under this Agreement that Parent or Merger Sub obtain the Debt
Financing or any other financing for or related to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby._

of the Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all
material respects, (b) the Company has complied with its obligations

participates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

  



  

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to (i)
waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company
Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or any of its
Affiliates that provides health benefits in which Company Employees may be
eligible to participate following the Closing, to the extent waived or
satisfied with respect to such employees as of the Closing under the
analogous Employee Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-
pocket maximums incurred by Company Employees and their eligible dependents
under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the
Closing during the portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing in
satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under
health plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates in which they are eligible to
participate after the Closing in the same plan year in which such
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his or her
eligible dependents on or after the Closing, in each case to the extent such
Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation
or requirement under an analogous Employee Plan prior to the Closing.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained herein, express or implied, (i) shall be
construed to establish, amend, terminate or modify or an undertaking to
establish, amend, terminate or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the

  



    

47

 

    

ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (or, following the Effective Time,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 7.2_ , express
or implied, shall not create any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement in any Company Employee or
any other Person to any continued employment or other service with the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, successors, or
assigns.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will seek equityholder
approval, intended to comply with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, of the
right of any "disqualified individual" who executes a waiver described in the
following sentence to receive or retain any payments that would reasonably be
expected, in the absence of such equityholder approval, to constitute
"excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code ("
_Waived Payments_ "). Prior to seeking such approvals, the Company shall
solicit waivers from the intended recipients of such payments such that unless
such payments are approved by the equityholders to the extent and in the
manner intended to comply with Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code, each of the Company and the Subsidiaries shall not make such
payments and the intended recipients shall have no right or entitlement with
respect thereto. The Company shall provide copies of any waivers, information
statements and voting materials related to the equityholder approval
described in this section to Parent reasonably in advance of distribution to
the equityholders or the "disqualified individuals", as applicable, and
Parent shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.
Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent reasonable assurance
that the vote of the equityholders solicited in a manner intended to comply
with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code occurred and (i)
the requisite Company equityholder approval of the Waived Payments was
obtained or (ii) such equityholder approval was not obtained and, as a
consequence, the Waived Payments shall not be made or provided.

hand, and Seller and the Company, on the other hand, agree that no press
release or public disclosure or announcement concerning the terms of the

regulations of any stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the
Company's Affiliates or Parent or one of its Affiliates are listed, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall (to the
extent permitted by Law) allow the other party reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Seller and the Company are permitted to (A) report and
disclose the status and terms (including price terms) of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby to their (or in the case of Seller, its
sponsors') direct or indirect limited partners if required by those governing
documents with those limited partners and otherwise in the ordinary course of
business and (B) disclose the consummation of the

  



    

48

 

    

transaction contemplated hereby (but not, without the consent of the other
parties, price terms or the name of such other parties) on their websites and
otherwise in the ordinary course of their business and (ii) each of Parent
and the Company is permitted to report and disclose the status of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to an internal
communication or otherwise to its employees (provided that the other party
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment in advance of on
any such report or disclosure).

  



  

Section 7.4 _Confidentiality._

  



  

(a) Parent acknowledges that the information provided to it and its
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement between Ipreo Holdings LLC and Markit Group

time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate at the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall hold (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to hold) in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial
or administrative process or by other requirements of applicable Law, all
documents and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries, except
to the extent that such information (i) is or becomes available to the public
through no fault of Seller or its Subsidiaries in breach of this Section

under an obligation of confidentiality to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) was independently developed by Seller or its Affiliates
without use of documents or information concerning the Company. The
obligation of Seller to hold any such information in confidence shall be
satisfied if it exercises the same care with respect to such information as

information.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Access to Information._

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date and subject to
applicable Laws and _Section 7.4_ , Parent shall be entitled, through its
officers, employees and Representatives (including its legal advisors and
accountants), to have such access to the personnel, accountants, properties,
businesses and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and such
examination of the Contracts, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as it reasonably requests upon reasonable advance written notice
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with obtaining
representation and warranty insurance). Any such access and examination shall
be conducted during regular business hours and under circumstances that do not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the business and shall
be subject to restrictions under applicable Law. The Company shall cause the
officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys and other
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent
and Parent's Representatives in connection with such access and examination,
and Parent and its Representatives shall cooperate with the Company and its
Representatives and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any disruption to the business. Any disclosure during such

  



    

49

 

    

investigation to Parent or its Representatives shall not constitute any
enlargement or additional representation or warranty of the Company beyond
those specifically set forth in _Article IV_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section _7.5(a)_ to the contrary, no such access or examination shall be
permitted to the extent that it (i) relates to interactions with other
prospective buyers of the Company or the negotiation of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) would unreasonably disrupt the
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) would require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose information that, in the
reasonable judgment and good faith of counsel to the Company, is subject to
attorney-client privilege or conflicts with any applicable Law or
confidentiality obligations to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound;  _provided_ , that, in the case of (iii), Parent and the Company shall
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide for information
or access in a manner that does not jeopardize any such privilege, or violate
any applicable Law or confidentiality obligation.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to
the Closing, (i) other than in the ordinary course of business of Parent
or any of its Affiliates with respect to matters not involving the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent shall not contact any customers of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the written consent of the
Company (which may be withheld in the Company's sole discretion); _provided_
that the Company shall have the right to have a Representative present during
any such contact in the event that it consents to such contact, and (ii)
Parent shall have no right to perform invasive or subsurface
investigations of the properties or facilities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent
may be withheld for any reason).

Laws, to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the

waivers and approvals of any Governmental Body necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereunder. Subject to applicable Law, each party
hereto shall provide to the other parties copies of all correspondence
between it (or its advisors) and any Governmental Antitrust Body or other
Governmental Body relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any of the matters described in this _Section 7.6_. Each of the parties
hereto shall promptly inform the other of any substantive oral communication
with, and provide copies of

  



    

50

 

    

written communications with, any Governmental Body regarding any such filings
or any such transaction, unless prohibited by request of any Governmental
Body or applicable Law. No party hereto shall independently participate in any
substantive meeting or conference call with any Governmental Body in respect
of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other
party prior notice of the meeting or conference call and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend or
participate. To the extent permissible under applicable Law, the parties
hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating
to proceedings under the Competition Laws; _provided_ that Parent shall
have principal responsibility for directing, devising and implementing the
strategy for obtaining any necessary approval of, or for responding to any
request from, inquiry by or investigation by (including directing the timing,
nature and substance of all such responses), and for leading any joint
meetings and communications with, any Governmental Body that has authority to
enforce any Competition Laws. The parties hereto may, as they deem advisable,
designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under
this _Section 7.6(b)_ or any other section of this Agreement as "legal counsel
only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such legal counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient
without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to
this _Section 7.6_ , the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide or cause to be provided (including by their "ultimate parent entities"
as that term is defined in the HSR Act) as promptly as practicable to any
Governmental Antitrust Body information and documents requested by such
Governmental Antitrust Body or necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including filing any notification and report form and related material
required under the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, and thereafter to respond promptly to any request for additional
information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act and
any similar Competition Law regarding preacquisition notifications for the
purpose of competition reviews. Parent shall cause (and shall cause its
"ultimate parent entity" as that term is defined in the HSR Act to cause) the
filings made by it under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early
termination," and make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be
necessary, proper, or advisable in connection therewith. Parent shall be
responsible for all filing fees applicable to Parent and its ultimate parent
entity under the HSR Act and under any such other Laws or
regulations applicable to Parent.

  



  

(d) Subject to the remainder of this _Section 7.6_ , if any objections
are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
applicable Law or if any Action is instituted by any Governmental Body or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any applicable Law, each of the parties hereto shall, at the sole
cost and expense of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) oppose or
defend against any action to prevent or enjoin consummation of this
Agreement (and the transactions contemplated hereby), and (ii) take such
action as reasonably necessary to overturn any regulatory action by any
Governmental Body to prevent or enjoin

  



    

51

 

    

consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated hereby),
including by defending any Action brought by any Governmental Body in order
to avoid entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by
appeal if necessary, in order to resolve any such objections or challenge as
such Governmental Body or private party may have to such transactions under
such applicable Law so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, take all actions necessary to obtain any authorization,
consent or approval of a Governmental Body necessary or advisable so as to
enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to occur as
soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, no later than the Outside Date)
and to resolve, avoid or eliminate any impediments or objections, if any,
that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
under any Competition Law, including: (i) taking such actions and agreeing to
such requirements or conditions to mitigate any concerns as may be
requested or required by a Governmental Body in connection with any
authorization, consent or approval of a Governmental Body, (ii)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of
businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries), (iii) terminating or restructuring
existing relationships, contractual or governance rights or obligations of
Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries), (iv) terminating any venture or other arrangement and (v)
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit Parent's or its Affiliates' (including the Surviving Company's
and its Subsidiaries'), freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain or control, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries), in each case as may be required in order to enable the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to occur as soon
as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) and
to otherwise avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
preliminary or permanent injunction that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and in
that regard Parent shall and, shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) to, agree to divest, sell, dispose
of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits its freedom of action with respect to Parent's or its Affiliates'
(including the Surviving Company's and its Subsidiaries') ability to retain
or control any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or any of
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries).

  



  

(f) From the date of this Agreement until Closing, neither Parent nor
Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries shall acquire or agree to acquire, by
merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any Person, if
the execution and delivery of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of, such acquisition would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose
any material delay in obtaining, or increase the risk of not obtaining,
consents of a Governmental Body necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of a Governmental Body

  



    

52

 

    

seeking or entering a Governmental Order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) increase the risk of not being able
to remove any such Governmental Order on appeal or otherwise, or (iv)
otherwise prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification._

  



  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have
under any Employee Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) and former officer, director,
manager or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Individuals_ ") from and against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to the fact that the Indemnified Individual was an officer, director, manager
or employee of the Company at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law (an " _Indemnified Matter_ "). In the
event of any Indemnified Matter, (A) promptly after receipt by an
Indemnified Individual of notice of its involvement in such Indemnified
Matter in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder, such
Indemnified Individual will notify the Surviving Company in writing of such
involvement (provided that failure to so notify the Surviving Company will
not relieve the Surviving Company from liability which they may have to such
Indemnified Individual pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ , except to the extent
the Surviving Company is materially prejudiced by such failure), (B) the
Surviving Company shall be entitled to participate in and assume the defense
of the Indemnified Individuals in connection with such Indemnified Matter,
(C) no Indemnified Individual shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any Indemnified Matter without the prior written consent
of the Surviving Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), (D) if the Surviving Company does not
elect to assume the defense of the Indemnified Individual in connection with
such Indemnified Matter, each Indemnified Individual will be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of such Indemnified Matter
from the Surviving Company within ten Business Days of receipt by the
Surviving Company from the Indemnified Individual of a request therefor, (E)
the Surviving Company shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any Indemnified Matter unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of an applicable Indemnified
Individual from all liability arising out of such Indemnified Matter or such
Indemnified Individual otherwise consents and (F) the Surviving Company shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

  



  

(b) The certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement (or equivalent governing documents) of each of the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of former or present (as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time) directors, managers and officers than are set forth in the
Organizational Documents of the

  



    

53

 

    

Company as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
such individuals.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall purchase a "tail" insurance
policy for a period of six years after the Effective Time, with reputable and
financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous than the
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising
from or related to facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective
Time; _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to pay an amount in respect
of such "tail" insurance policy in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of its directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage; _provided_ , further that if the
Parent is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section 7.7(c)_ ,
it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for each year within
such six-year period for an aggregate amount equal to 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof. Parent agrees to take
all necessary actions to maintain such policies in full force and effect and
fulfill its obligations thereunder throughout such six year period following
the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or
after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Individual on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
_Section 7.7_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

  



  

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Individuals and their
respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for
herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Individual is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or
otherwise.

  



  

(f) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.7_.

  



  

Section 7.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Without limiting the parties'
obligations under _Section 7.6_ and subject thereto, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions herein provided, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, to do or cause to be done
and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including: (a) the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent

  



    

54

 

    

 _to the obligations of any of the parties; (b) the obtaining of applicable
consents, waivers or approvals of any Governmental Bodies or third
parties; (c) the defending of any Actions challenging this Agreement or the
performance of the obligations hereby; (d) repay, prepay or satisfy and
discharge the Existing Senior Notes pursuant to the applicable provisions of
the Notes Indenture, and Parent will provide on the Closing Date funds in an
amount equal to the principal, interest and any additional amounts necessary
for the Company to redeem, repurchase or discharge the Existing Senior Notes
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be treated as Funded
Indebtedness); and (e) the execution and delivery of such instruments, and
the taking of such other actions, as the other party may reasonably require
in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Party, nor any of its Affiliates, shall be obligated to make
any payments or otherwise pay any consideration to any third party to obtain
any applicable consent, waiver or approval._

  



  

Section 7.9 _Parent Financing._

  



  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitments (including complying with any request
exercising so-called "flex" provisions contained therein), including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing
Commitments, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding in the
Debt Financing Commitments and such definitive agreements to be entered into
pursuant thereto, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitments (including any "flex" provisions contained therein) prior to the
Closing Date, (iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments
and (v) in the event that all conditions in the Debt Financing Commitments
have been satisfied, cause the lenders and other Persons providing Debt
Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing required to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. To the
extent requested by the Company from time to time, Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts
to arrange the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) and Parent shall
provide to the Company copies of all documents related to the Debt Financing
(or Alternative Financing). In the event any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions) contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments for any reason
(A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and (B) Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative financing from
alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount, when
added with Parent and Merger Sub's existing cash on hand, sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which would not
(i) involve terms and conditions that are materially less beneficial to
Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) involve any conditions to funding the Debt
Financing that are not contained in the Debt Financing Commitments and (iii)
would not reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of, and
not in limitation of, the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, but any

  



    

55

 

    

bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (or
alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this
_Section 7.9(a)_ ) are available on the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Financing Commitments (or replacements thereof), then Parent shall cause
the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in lieu of such contemplated
Debt Financing as promptly as practicable. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing (A) if
there exists any breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by
any party to the Debt Financing Commitments (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or
termination), (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice
or other written communication from any lender or other Debt Financing Source
with respect to any actual breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or
termination by any party to the Debt Financing Commitments or (C) if for any
reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that (I) there is (or
there is reasonably likely to be) a dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to any Debt Financing Commitments or any definitive document
related to the Debt Financing or (II) there is a reasonable possibility that
it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments or the definitive documents related to the Debt Financing. As soon
as reasonably practicable, Parent shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause
(A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence. Parent and Merger Sub
shall not (without the prior written consent of the Company) consent or agree
to any amendment, replacement, supplement or modification to, or any waiver of
any provision under, the Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive
agreements relating to the Debt Financing if such amendment, replacement,
supplement, modification or waiver (1) decreases the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing to an amount that would be less than an amount that would be
required to consummate the Merger and make the other payments required to be
made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company hereunder or otherwise
contemplated in connection herewith and repay or refinance the debt
contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitments, (2) imposes
new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of
the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, (3) would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (4) adversely impacts the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Financing Commitments. Parent shall furnish to the Company a copy of any
amendment, modification, waiver or consent of or relating to the Debt
Financing Commitments promptly upon execution thereof. Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the
Debt Financing Commitments until the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated. Notwithstanding the immediately foregoing two
sentences, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub may amend,
replace, supplement and/or modify the Debt Financing Commitments solely to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
as parties thereto who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of
the date hereof. Parent shall provide the Company, upon reasonable request,
with such information and documentation as shall be reasonably necessary to
allow the Company to monitor the progress of such financing activities. Upon
any amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt Financing Commitments,
Parent shall provide a copy thereof to the

  



    

56

 

    

Company and, to the extent such amendment, supplement or modification has
been made in compliance with this _Section 7.9(a)_ , the term "Debt Financing
Commitments" shall mean the Debt Financing Commitments as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or modified, including any Alternative Financing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent with this _Section 7.9 _
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Debt Financing
is available and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are not contingent on
Parent or Merger Sub's ability to obtain the Debt Financing (or any
Alternative Financing) or any specific term with respect to such financing.

  



  

(b) In connection with the Debt Financing, the Company shall provide,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
and that is necessary in connection with Parent's efforts to obtain the Debt
Financing (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company), including: (A)
participation in marketing meetings, rating agency presentations and due
diligence sessions and assisting with the preparation of, and
furnishing Parent and the Debt Financing Sources with the financial and other
customary information regarding the Company that is necessary for the
preparation of customary bank information memoranda or rating agency
presentations in connection with the Debt Financing Commitments, upon
reasonable advanced notice, (B) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, providing all documentation and other information about the

opinions and payoff letters and deliver notice of prepayment or redemption
within the time periods required by the relevant agreements governing the
Company and its Subsidiaries' existing Indebtedness; provided that none of
Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur
any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Closing for which it is not reimbursed by Parent.

outside attorneys' fees and (B) fees and expenses of the Company's accounting
firms engaged to assist in connection with the Debt Financing, including
performing additional requested procedures, reviewing any offering documents,
participating in any meetings and providing any comfort letters) to
the extent incurred by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, agents, investment bankers and other representatives in connection
with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries

  



    

57

 

    

contemplated by this _Section 7.9_ , (ii) acknowledges and agrees that,
except for obligations from and after the Closing that arise under the
definitive agreements governing the Debt Financing or closing certificates
relating to the Debt Financing, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, agents, investment bankers and other Representatives shall not have
any responsibility for, or incur any liability to, any Person under any
arrangement with respect to the Debt Financing that Parent or Merger Sub may
request in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (iii) shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective directors, officers, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, agents, investment bankers and other
representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the
performance of their respective obligations under this _Section 7.9_
(including any action taken in accordance with this _Section 7.9_ ) and any
information utilized in connection therewith.

  



  

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company
or its Subsidiaries (which, for the avoidance of doubt, do not include any
logos of Seller, Seller's sponsors or their respective Affiliates (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries)) by Parent and Merger Sub in connection
with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or that is
not reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries' reputation or
goodwill.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Termination of Affiliate Contracts_. In connection with the
Closing, Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, take all such actions as may be necessary to
terminate, release, cancel, pay or otherwise settle prior to the Closing each
Affiliate Contract (including the Contracts set forth on Section 7.10 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) other than Affiliate Contracts that are
commercial contracts that are in all material respects on arms' length terms
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) any commercial contracts with
portfolio companies of Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC and The Blackstone Group L.P.
or their respective Affiliates that are in all material respects on arms'
length terms and (ii) any engagement letters for investment banking advisory
services in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
entered into with Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC on or after the date hereof (it
being understood and agreed that all fees, costs and expenses payable
thereunder shall be Company Transaction Expenses for all purposes under
this Agreement), in each case with no Liabilities to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 7.11 _Preservation of Records_. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to, preserve and keep the records held by them relating to
the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a period of
seven years following the Closing Date (or longer if required by applicable
Law) and shall make such records (or copies) and reasonably appropriate
personnel available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice,
to Seller or Seller's Affiliates as may be reasonably required by such party
in connection with any insurance claims by, legal proceedings or Tax
audits against, governmental investigations of, or compliance with applicable
Laws by Seller or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 7.11_ to the contrary, no such access or examination

  



    

58

 

    

 _shall be permitted to the extent that it (i) would unreasonably disrupt the
operations of Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(ii) would require Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to disclose information that, in the reasonable judgment and good faith of
counsel to Parent or the Surviving Company, is subject to attorney-client
privilege or conflicts with any applicable Law or confidentiality obligations
to which Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;
provided, that, in the case of clause (ii), Parent and Seller shall cooperate
and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide for information or access
in a manner that does not jeopardize any such privilege or violate applicable
Law or confidentiality obligation._

  



  

Section 7.12 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) The parties intend that the acquisition pursuant to this Agreement
be treated as a taxable acquisition of assets of Seller for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "). Except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law, Seller and Parent shall (i) prepare and
file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and (ii) take no position
inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment in any Tax Return, any Tax
proceeding before any Governmental Body or otherwise absent a determination
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code to the contrary.

  



  

(b) Seller shall prepare and deliver to Parent, within 90 days after
Closing, an initial allocation of the purchase price among the assets of
Seller for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code, the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and the methodology
set forth on Section 7.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Tax
Allocation_ "). The Tax Allocation shall become final and binding on the
parties hereto ten calendar days after Seller provides such schedule to
Parent, unless Parent notifies Seller in writing that it objects to the
allocation set forth in the Tax Allocation. Parent and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within 20 days. In the
event that Parent and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute within 20
days, such dispute shall be referred to a national recognized accounting firm
whose determination shall be final and binding upon the parties. Upon
resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the Tax
Allocation shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and
expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Parent and Seller.
If an adjustment is made to the purchase price pursuant to Section _3.5_ , the
Tax Allocation shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and as mutually agreed by Parent and Seller. In the event that an agreement
is not reached within 20 days after the determination of Final Merger
Consideration, any disputed items shall be resolved in the manner described
above. The parties agree that no portion of the purchase price shall be
allocated to any Leased Real Property. Seller and Parent shall report
consistently with the Tax Allocation in all Tax Returns, including Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594, which Seller and Parent shall timely file with the
Internal Revenue Service, and neither Seller nor Parent shall take
any position in any return that is inconsistent with the Tax Allocation, as
adjusted, in each case, unless required to do so by a final determination as
defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  



    

59

 

    

(c) Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable
best efforts to (or cause their respective Affiliates to) deliver to Seller
as soon as practicable following the end of each Specified Partnership's
taxable year that includes the Closing Date (and on or before the day that
such U.S. federal schedule K-1s have historically been provided to Seller, as
reasonably determined in good faith by Seller) any U.S. federal schedule K-1s
and such other information, with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as is necessary for the preparation of Seller's Tax Returns.

  



  

(d) Parent agrees to give prompt written notice to Seller of any
assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or
proceeding, relating in whole or in part to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries during which the taxable income of the
Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, was treated, for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, as passed through to Seller (" _Tax Contest_ ") and give
to Seller such information with respect thereto as Seller (or its
Affiliate) may reasonably request. To the extent permitted under applicable
Law, Seller (or its Affiliate) may participate in and assume the defense of
any such Tax Contest that relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period;
_provided_ that (i) Seller shall provide Parent with copies of all material
correspondence, notice or other written materials received from any Tax
Authority in connection with, and shall otherwise keep Parent reasonably
informed of the progress of, such Tax Contest, (ii) Seller shall consult
with Parent upon Parent's reasonable request for such consultation from time
to time with respect to such Tax Contest, and (iii) Seller shall not agree to
any settlement with respect to any Tax Contest that could adversely affect a
Post-Closing Tax Period, the Tax liability of Parent or any of its Affiliates
or the status of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a partnership or
disregarded entity for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, in each case,
without Parent's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld. If Parent controls any Tax Contest, (A) Parent shall
provide Seller with copies of all material correspondence, notice or other
written materials received from any Tax Authority in connection with, and
shall otherwise keep Seller reasonably informed of the progress of, such Tax
Contest, (B) Parent shall consult with Seller upon Seller's
reasonable request for such consultation from time to time with respect to
such Tax Contest, and (C) none of Parent, the Company and the Company's
Subsidiaries shall settle any such Tax Contest without the consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(e) Seller agrees that, except with respect to a Specified Partnership
that is eligible to make an election under Section 6226(a) of the Code with
respect to a taxable year of such Specified Partnership beginning before the
Closing Date (for purposes of determining eligibility, it shall be assumed
such Specified Partnership duly complies with all procedural requirements in
Section 6226(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder), at the
written request of Parent, Seller shall prepare and file, at its expense,
such amended return(s) described in Section 6225(c)(2) of the Code with
respect to a taxable year of a Specified Partnership, and pay such taxes as
may be due with each such return, in each case in accordance with the
requirement of Section 6225(c)(2) of the Code and any applicable Treasury
regulations.

  



    

60

 

    

(f) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit for the
taxable year of a Specified Partnership that includes the Closing Date shall
be allocated pursuant to Section 706 of the Code based on a closing of the
books on the Closing Date.

  



  

(g) Seller will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in
taking all actions permitted or required to be taken by or on behalf
of Seller under the partnership agreement of the relevant Specified
Partnership for each Specified Partnership to have a valid election under
Section 754 of the Code in effect for the taxable year that includes the
Closing Date.

  



  

Section 7.13 _Trademarks; Tradenames_. Promptly after the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, change their names (if
necessary) to a name that does not include any of the trademarks, service
marks, domain names, trade names or other indicia of origin included in the
Owned Intellectual Property (including Ipreo) or any derivative thereof or
anything confusingly similar thereto (collectively, the " _Company Marks_ "),
and after the Closing none of Seller, its Affiliates or any of their
respective directors, officers, successors, assigns, agents
or representatives shall (i) register or attempt to register, or directly or
indirectly use in any fashion, including in signage, corporate letterhead,
business cards, internet websites or marketing material, or seek to register,
in connection with any products or services anywhere in the world in any
medium, any Company Mark, in each case other than fair or nominative use of
such Company Marks under applicable law, or (ii) challenge or assist any
third party in opposing the rights of Parent or any of its
Affiliates anywhere in the world in any of the Company Marks.

  



  

Section 7.14 _Other Matters_.

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to (or cause one of its Affiliates to) replace Seller as guarantor
under the Ipreo US LLC Community Development Agreement (Grant No. 2012-37),
dated as of April 11, 2013 (the " _North Carolina CDA_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Parent is unable to replace Seller as guarantor under the
North Carolina CDA prior to the Closing, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and after the Closing for any and all
losses that result from or are incurred in connection with Seller's status as
guarantor under the North Carolina CDA for so long as Seller remains a
guarantor thereunder. Seller will not terminate, alter or amend the North
Carolina CDA until Seller is replaced as guarantor by Parent.

  



  

(b) The parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the amount set forth
on Section 7.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule opposite the name of
each employee of the Company set forth on Section 7.14(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (as such amount may be reduced prior to the Closing)
under the heading "Amount Owed to the Company" will be deducted from any
portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration, Excess Amount, if any, or
Remaining Amount, if any that would otherwise be payable to such employees by
Seller and will be deemed to repay the Company, on behalf of each such
employee, such amounts.

  



  

(c) If the Closing occurs on or prior to December 31, 2018, in the
event any cash proceeds from a sale or recapitalization of any or all of the
common equity or preferred equity of Discovery Holdco, LLC held by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as

  



    

61

 

    

of the date hereof (such equity, the " _Discovery Equity_ " and such
proceeds, " _Discovery Proceeds_ ") are received by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Adjustment Time and on or prior to December 31, 2018,
then the first $17 million of such Discovery Proceeds, net of any Tax
liability incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates (determined without
regard to the use or availability of any net operating loss, capital loss or
other Tax asset (except, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax basis in the
Discovery Equity) belonging to Parent or any of its Affiliates to reduce such
Tax liability) with respect to Seller's portion of any such Discovery
Proceeds, shall be paid to Seller and all Discovery Proceeds in excess of $17
million shall be paid to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, no proceeds from
a sale of any or all of the Discovery Equity (i) if the Closing occurs on or
prior to December 31, 2018, received after December 31, 2018 or (ii) if the
Closing occurs after December 31, 2018, received after the Adjustment Time,
shall be required to be paid to Seller. The parties will work in good faith
to structure the foregoing arrangements in a manner that is tax efficient for
both parties (and their direct and indirect equityholders). The amounts
payable pursuant to this _Section 7.14(c)_ shall be treated as an adjustment
to the purchase price for U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. income Tax
purposes to the extent permitted by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the sale or recapitalization of any or all of the
Discovery Equity in a bona fide transaction with a non-Related Party in
accordance with this _Section 7.14(c)_ shall not be deemed to be in violation
of ___Section 7.1_ hereof.

  



  

(d) At or prior to the Closing, Seller will use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) remove Seller and any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) as a named insured or additional insured
under each of the insurance policies listed on, or required to be listed on,
Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) ensure that the
Company (or at the written request of Parent, one of the Company's
Subsidiaries) is a named insured thereunder.

  



  

(e) At or prior to Closing, the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to fully settle, resolve or compromise the Oracle Matter; 
_provided_ that (i) any such settlement, resolution or compromise shall only
involve the payment of cash and shall not result in any other Liability or
restriction on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to include a customary release related to
all matters underlying the Oracle Matter; _provided_ that if the
Oracle Matter is not fully settled, resolved or compromised prior to Closing,
a good faith estimate of all Liabilities arising out of or relating to the
Oracle Matter shall be included as a current liability in Working Capital.

_however_ , that neither the Company nor Parent

  



    

64

 

    

(as applicable) may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.1(a)_ if it (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) is in material breach
of any of its obligations hereunder and such material breach causes, or
results in, either (i) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the

Outside Date, or (ii) the failure of the Closing to have occurred prior to
the Outside Date;

  



  

(b) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  



  

(c) by the Company or Parent if there shall be in effect a final,
nonappealable Governmental Order of a Governmental Body having

_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(c)_ shall not be available to the party seeking to terminate if
such party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) is then in breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Article VIII_ , as
applicable;

  



  

(d) by Parent if (i) Parent and Merger Sub are not in material breach
of any of their respective obligations hereunder and (ii) the Company is in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or obligations
hereunder that would render any condition set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or

capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or (B) if curable, is not
cured within the earlier of (x) ten Business Days after the giving of
written notice by Parent to the Company and (y) five Business Days prior to
the Outside Date;

  



  

(e) by the Company if (i) the Company and Seller are not in material
breach of any of their respective obligations hereunder and (ii) Parent or
Merger Sub is in material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
obligations hereunder that would render any condition set forth in _Section
8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ not to be satisfied, and such breach is either (A)
not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or (B) if curable, is
not cured within the earlier of (x) ten Business Days after the giving of

action by any of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub.

  



  

Section 9.3 _Effect of Termination._

  



  

(a) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Section 9.1_ , then this Agreement shall become void and
each of the parties shall be relieved of its duties and obligations arising
under this Agreement after the date of such

  



    

65

 

    

termination and such termination shall be without liability to any party
hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to the terms of this _Section
9.3_ , (i) no such termination shall (A) restrict the availability of specific
performance, if any, set forth in Section 11.13 or (B) relieve any party
hereto from liability for damages (excluding punitive or exemplary damages)
resulting from Fraud or any Willful Breach and (ii) the provisions of
_Section 7.3_ , _Section 7.4_ , _Section 7.9(c)_ , this  _Article IX_ ,
_Section 10.1_ and _Article XI_ (other than Section _11.17_ ) shall remain in
full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. In the event of a Willful Breach by Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, or Seller or the Company, on the other hand,
Seller's and the Company's, or Parent's and Merger Sub's, as applicable,
right to sue for damages shall include damages based on loss of the economic
benefits of the transactions contemplated hereby to Seller (in the case of a
Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub) or Parent (in the case of a Willful
Breach by Seller or the Company), as applicable, and their respective direct
and indirect equity-holders. For purposes of this _Section 9.3_ , the term
"Willful Breach" means a party's knowing and intentional material breach of
any of its representations or warranties as set forth in this Agreement, or
such party's material breach of any of its covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which material breach constitutes, or is a
consequence of, a purposeful act or failure to act by such party with the
knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act would cause
a material breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a failure
by Parent and Merger Sub to close in accordance with this Agreement when they
are obligated to do so, the inability of Parent to make any of the payments
contemplated by this Agreement (including the payments contemplated by
_Article II_ ) and/or the failure to obtain any financing necessary to make
such payments shall be deemed to be a Willful Breach.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement may
only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be

any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any
claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement

connection herewith.

Representative, or Parent's or Merger Sub's use of any information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent
or Merger Sub in the Electronic Data Room or management presentations in
expectation of the Merger or otherwise. Except for the representations and

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_ , Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree to the Company's express disavowal and disclaimer of
any other representations and warranties, whether made by the Company or any
other Person on behalf of the Company, and of all liability and

other material made available to Parent or Merger Sub, including any opinion,
information, projection, forecast or other information that may have been or
may be provided to Parent or Merger Sub by any director, officer, employee,

representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to any financial
projection or forecast delivered to Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the
performance of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries either before or after
the Closing Date. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that they have
conducted to their satisfaction their own independent investigation of the
condition, operations and businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries and,
in making their determination to proceed with the Merger, Parent and Merger
Sub have been provided and have evaluated such documents and information as
they have deemed necessary and have relied solely on the results of their own
independent investigation and verification and the representations and
warranties expressly contained in _Article IV_ and _Article V_.

  



  

(c) Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, subsidiaries, controlling persons, agents and
other Representatives hereby acknowledge that, except for the representations
and warranties contained in _Article IV_ and _Article V_ , no other
statutory, express or implied representation or warranty, whether written or
oral, concerning the Membership Interests, the Merger or the business, assets
or liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries, the execution, delivery or
performance of this

  



    

67

 

    

Agreement or any other matter, including any implied warranties of
merchantability and implied warranties of fitness for a particular
purpose, is or has been made.

  



  

Section 10.2 _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement shall not survive
beyond the Closing and, except in the case of Fraud, there shall be no
liability in respect thereof, whether such liability has accrued prior to or
after the Closing, on the part of any party, its Affiliates or any of their
respective officers, directors, agents or other Representatives, except for
those covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be
performed in whole or in part at or after the Closing and for _Article XI_
(other than _Section 11.17_ ).

  



  

Section 10.3 _Release_. As a material inducement to Guarantor, Parent and
Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements
to which it is a party, effective as of the Closing, Seller agrees (on behalf
of itself and its Subsidiaries) not to sue and to fully release and discharge,
Guarantor, Parent, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, and each
director, officer and employee of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
(in his or her capacity as such), from any and all Liabilities, claims,
demands, rights, Liens, Contracts (including employment Contracts), covenants
or proceedings, of whatever kind or nature in Law, equity or otherwise,
whether now known or unknown, and whether or not concealed or hidden
(collectively, " _Released Claims_ "), which in each case any such Person has
asserted or could have asserted against the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
director, officer or employee thereof (in his or her capacity as such)
arising out of acts, facts, circumstances or omissions existing, occurring or
taking place prior to the Closing; _provided _ that the foregoing agreement,
release and discharge shall not limit or apply in respect of any Released
Claims arising under this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements. It
is the intention of Seller that such release be effective as a bar to
each and every Released Claim hereinabove specified. In furtherance of this
intention, Seller hereby expressly waives, effective as of the Closing, any
and all rights and benefits conferred upon it by the provisions of any Law
with respect to the Released Claims hereinabove specified and expressly
consents to this release being given full force and effect according to each
and all of its express terms and provisions, including those related to
unknown and unsuspected Released Claims, if any, to the same extent as those
relating to any other Released Claims hereinabove specified. Seller (1)
represents, warrants and acknowledges that it has been, or has had the
opportunity to be, fully advised by its attorney of the contents of Section
1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California and (2) expressly waives
any rights or benefits under Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of
California and any similar provisions of applicable law of any other
jurisdiction. Section 1542 states: "A general release does not extend to
claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at
the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially
affected his settlement with the debtor."

  



  

Article XI 
  
  _MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

Section 11.1 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. This Agreement and the rights
hereunder are not assignable unless such assignment is consented to in
writing by both Parent

  



    

68

 

    

and the Company and, subject to the preceding clause, this Agreement and all
the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent may assign its rights hereunder in whole or in part
to (a) one or more of its Affiliates, and (b) following the Closing, to any
Person, but, in each case, no such assignment shall relieve Parent of any of
its obligations under this Agreement.

(a) This Agreement and all Actions (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this

of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York located in

objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the

based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made
in or in connection with this Agreement) in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
located in New York, New York or any court of the State of New York sitting in

Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action
in any such court and (iv) agrees that a final judgment in any such Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered
mail addressed to it at the applicable address in _Section 11.4_ set
forth below shall be effective service of process for any Action brought in
any such court. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (i) that it will not bring
or support, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or

  



    

69

 

    

support, any Action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, involving the Debt Financing Sources arising out of, or
relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Financing
Commitments, the Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder or
related thereto in any forum other than the state or federal court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court thereof
and each party hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any
such Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (ii) to waive and
hereby waives any right to trial by jury in respect of any such Action and
(iii) that any such Action shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to the conflicts of
law rules of such State that would result in the application of the laws of
any other State.

  



  

Section 11.3 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE, AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM WITH RESPECT THERETO OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT FINANCING. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (I) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE MERGER BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN

Section 11.9 _Company Disclosure Schedule._

  



  

(a) The Company Disclosure Schedule and the information and disclosures
contained therein relate to and qualify certain of the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations made by the Company in
this Agreement and shall not be construed or otherwise deemed to constitute,
any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company or any
other Person. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in
the Company

  



    

73

 

    

Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission or indication, in and
of itself, that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance, that such item has had or would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, or that such item or other matter is
required to be referred to or disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only. No
reference in the Company Disclosure Schedule to any agreement or document, in
and of itself, shall be construed as an admission or indication that such
agreement or document is enforceable or currently in effect or that there are
any obligations remaining to be performed or any rights that may be exercised
under such agreement or document. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure
Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation of, or non-
compliance with, any agreement, law or regulation, in and of itself, shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach, violation or
non-compliance exists or has actually occurred, and nothing in the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall constitute an admission of any liability or
obligation of any Person to any other Person or shall confer or give any third
party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or any
other right whatsoever. Neither the specification of any item or matter in
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion
of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply
that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the
ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting
forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described in this Agreement or included in the Company
Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business for
purposes of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule is arranged in
sections corresponding to the Sections in this Agreement and any items or
matters set forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the Section or subsection of
this Agreement to which it corresponds and each other Section or subsection
of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such items or matters to
such other Section or subsection of this Agreement is, on the face of such
items or matters, reasonably apparent. The inclusion of any cross-references
to any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or the
failure to include such cross-references, shall not be deemed to mean that
the relevance of any disclosure is not, on its face, reasonably apparent for
the purposes of the immediately preceding sentence. The headings contained in
the Company Disclosure Schedule are included for convenience and reference
only, and are not intended to limit the effect of the disclosures contained in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or to expand, modify or influence the scope
of the information required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule
or the interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The information contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule is
confidential, proprietary information of the Company, and Parent and Merger
Sub shall be obligated to maintain and protect such confidential information
pursuant to this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement. In disclosing
the information in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company expressly does
not waive any attorney-client privilege or other similar privilege associated
with such information or any protection afforded by the work-product
doctrine or other similar doctrine with respect to any of the matters
disclosed or discussed herein.

  



    

74

 

    

Section 11.10 _Waiver and Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented only by a mutual written agreement executed and delivered by
Seller and Parent. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof
only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but
such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure; _provided_ _further_ that
no amendment, modification or supplement shall be made to this Agreement that
would adversely affect the rights of the Debt Financing Sources as set forth
in this _Section 11.10_ , _Section 9.3_ , _Section 11.2_ , _Section 11.3_ and
_Section 11.12_ (and in each case any related definitions to the extent a
modification, waiver or termination of such definitions would modify the
substance of any of the foregoing provisions) without the prior written
consent of such adversely affected Debt Financing Sources.

  



  

Section 11.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including by means of facsimile or email in Portable Document
Format, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement
and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and
the same agreement.

  



  

Section 11.12 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns except
as set forth in _Section 7.7_ , _Section 10.1_ and _Section 11.15_ which
rights are hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed to by Parent and Merger
Sub, nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever,
including any rights of employment for any specified period, under or
by reason of this Agreement; provided that the Debt Financing Sources shall
be express third-party beneficiaries of and have the right to enforce this
Section 11.2, _Section 9.3(b)_ , _Section 11.2_ , _Section 11.3_ , and
_Section 11.10_.

  



  

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that the rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) are unique and recognizes and affirms that
irreparable damage would occur, money damages would be inadequate and the non-
breaching party would have no adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached.
Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-breaching party shall have
the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their
favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the other party's
obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by
an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief (without proof of damages and without posting of bond or
other security) to prevent breaches of this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and any Transaction Agreement. If any party brings any action
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by
any other party, the party bringing such action may unilaterally extend the
Outside Date (notwithstanding the termination provisions of _Section 9.1_ ),
so long as the party bringing such action is actively seeking a court
order for an injunction or injunctions or to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this

  



    

75

 

    

Agreement or any Transaction Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief on the basis that (i) there is an appropriate remedy at law
or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or in equity. In no event shall the exercise of a party's right
to seek specific performance pursuant to this _Section 11.13_ reduce,
restrict or otherwise limit such party's right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or pursue any other applicable remedy at law,
including seeking money damages.

  



  

Section 11.14 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision hereof.

  



  

Section 11.15 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed
or implied in this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in
connection herewith, by its acceptance of the benefits of this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub each covenants, agrees and acknowledges that
no Persons other than Seller and the Company have any
liabilities, obligations, commitments (whether known or unknown or whether
contingent or otherwise) hereunder, and that, notwithstanding that the
equityholders of Seller or their respective managing members or general
partners may be partnerships or limited liability companies, Parent has no
right of recovery under this Agreement, or any claim based on such
liabilities, obligations, commitments against, and no personal liability
shall attach to, the former, current or future equityholders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers or general or limited partners of any of the Company or any
former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate or agent of
any of the foregoing, in each case other than Seller and the Company
(collectively, but not including Seller and the Company, each a " _Non-
Recourse Party_ "), through the Company or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of the Company against any Non-Recourse Party, by the enforcement of
any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
statute, regulation or Law, or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 11.15_ , nothing in this _Section 11.15_ shall be
deemed to limit any liabilities or obligations of, or claims against, any
party to any other Transaction Agreement, or serve as a waiver of any right on
the part of any party to any such other Transaction Agreement to initiate any
Action permitted pursuant to, and in accordance with the specific terms of
such other Transaction Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.16 _Representation_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of their Affiliates, and each of
their and their Affiliates' managers, directors, members, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns (all such
parties, the " _Waiving Parties_ "), that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP may
represent Seller, Affiliates of Seller or any manager, director, member,
partner, officer, employee or other Representative of Seller or Affiliates of
Seller in connection with any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including under any
agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (any such representation, the " _Post-Closing
Representation_ ") notwithstanding its

  



    

76

 

    

representation (or any continued representation) of the Company and/or any of
its Subsidiaries, and each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company on behalf of
itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives
(and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising
therefrom or relating thereto. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge
that the foregoing provision applies whether or not Weil, Gotshal and Manges
LLP provides legal services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after
the Closing Date. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, for itself and
the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries, Seller and
their legal counsel, including Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, made in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance
under, or any dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or any matter relating to any of the
foregoing, that are privileged communications between Seller and such counsel
(notwithstanding that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries participated or
was provided such communications nor that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is also a client of such legal counsel) shall remain
privileged communications from and after the Closing and neither Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, nor any Person
purporting to act on behalf of or through Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or
any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process. From
and after the Closing, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, on behalf
of itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not assert any attorney-
client privilege with respect to any privileged communication between Weil,
Gotshal and Manges LLP and the Company, its Subsidiaries or Seller occurring
prior to the Closing in connection with this Agreement, any of the agreements
contemplated hereby, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or therein or
any Post-Closing Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that a dispute arises between Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, on the one hand, and a third party other than a Seller, on the other
hand, Parent, the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of such communications to
such third party;  _provided_ , that none of Parent, the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company may waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of Seller.

  



  

Section 11.17 _Guarantee_. Guarantor shall cause Parent to comply with all of
its obligations under this Agreement through and including the Closing,
including those obligations set forth in _Section 2.2_ and _Section 11.13_
(collectively, the " _Obligations_ "). Guarantor, intending to be legally
bound, hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a
primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual performance
of the Obligations, and if Parent shall default in the due and punctual
performance of any such Obligations, Seller shall be entitled to enforce
directly against Guarantor such obligations. The Guarantor represents and
warrants as follows: (i) the Guarantor has the necessary power and authority
to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder; (ii) the
execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of this Agreement have
been duly authorized by any necessary action on the part of the Guarantor and
its board of directors or other governing body; and (iii) this Agreement,
assuming due execution and delivery by the respective parties hereto,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor,
enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms.
