Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock (including all uncertificated shares of Company Common
Stock represented by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each
certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ")) shall no

Shares_ "), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(iii) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each

Merger Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



16 (b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, shares of Company Common Stock issued and

respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _DGCL 262_ " and any such shares
meeting the requirement of this sentence, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead
at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive payment of
such amounts as are payable in accordance with DGCL 262 (it being understood
and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
other than the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares to
the extent afforded by DGCL 262); _provided_ , that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right
to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under DGCL 262, then

Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any
demands received by the Company for fair value of any Company Shares, of any
withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to
the DGCL and received by the Company relating to DGCL 262 and any alleged
dissenterÂ’s rights, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.

consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise
or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the

changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event

prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ _however_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
this _Article III_ , and following any losses from any such investment Parent

other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.1_ , except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event within 10 Business Days of the Closing Date,

shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were

Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent shall
reasonably designate) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(d) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of

Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement promptly following
the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Payment AgentÂ’s
receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to such a
transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Payment
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence to the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that any
applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The cash paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ in respect of any shares of
Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights

 



18  pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock (subject to DGCL 262).
From and after the Effective Time, all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other
than the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ or _3.2(d)_ , as applicable,
in each case without interest or duplication. From and after the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to this
Agreement are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Payment
Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_ , subject to DGCL
262 in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent designated by Parent, upon written demand,
and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws),
as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Payment
Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any person in
respect of any portion of the Payment Fund or the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding,
any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the second anniversary of
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Payment Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Parent or the Payment Agent may determine is reasonably necessary
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Payment Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to _Section
3.2(f)_ , Parent) shall deliver or cause to be delivered, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration.

withholding Taxes) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award or
Company Performance Share Unit Award as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , that to the extent that
any such Company RSU Award or Company Performance Share Unit Award
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code, such cash payment shall be paid in accordance with the applicable
awardÂ’s terms and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of
such award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code. For each Company Performance Share Unit Award, the
number of shares covered by the applicable award shall be the greater of (A)
such number based on performance deemed achieved at target, with pro-ration
for the portion of the performance period that elapsed through the date of the
Merger, and (B) such number based on actual performance through the date of

inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to this _Section 6.3_ and to limit

fide_ , unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any person that did
not result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_ , solely to the extent

waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, or fail to
enforce, any confidentiality obligations with respect to a Company Takeover
Proposal or similar matter or any standstill provision in any agreement to

counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and
its Representatives may (i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , that the
Company shall concurrently with the delivery to such person provide to Parent

that is provided or made available to such person or its Representatives
unless such non-public

 



47  information has been previously provided or made available to Parent, and

Board of Directors makes a determination that a Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior
Proposal or if the Company furnishes information or enters into discussions or
negotiations as provided in this _Section 6.3(c)_.

 

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall as promptly as
practicable (and in no event later than within one Business Day (but in no
event longer than 48 hours)) after receipt by an executive officer or director

information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in or that contemplates a Company

the Company) providing to Parent copies of any correspondence, proposals,
indications of interest or draft agreements relating to such Company Takeover
Proposal). The Company agrees that it and its Affiliates will not enter into
any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which
prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance
with, or otherwise complying with, this  _Section 6.3(d)_.

(e) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.3(f)_ , the Company Board of
Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the

Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board of
Directors may, with respect to a _bona fide_ , unsolicited Company Takeover
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_ , make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to

 



48  terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(g)_ in order to
enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Company Takeover Proposal
if and only if, prior to taking either such action, (i) the Company has
complied with its obligations under this _Section 6.3_ and (ii) the Company
Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that
prior to making such Adverse Recommendation Change or effecting such
termination, (A) the Company has given Parent at least three Business DaysÂ’
prior notice of its intention to take such action, specifying the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
person making, any such Company Superior Proposal and has

a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements and a copy of any
financing commitments relating thereto (or, in each case, if not provided in
writing to the Company, a written summary of the terms and conditions
thereof), (B) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated in
good faith with Parent and its Representatives during such notice period to
enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that
it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Company Superior Proposal, (C) following the end of such notice period, the
Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and shall have
determined, after consultation with its independent financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless
continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed
by Parent were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any change to any of
the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal,
the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice
consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new
notice period under clause (C) of this proviso shall commence (except that
the three Business Day notice period referred to in clause (A) above of this
proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (x) two Business Days and (y)
the period remaining under the notice period under clause (A) of this proviso
immediately prior to the delivery of such additional notice under this clause
(D)) during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 6.3(f)_ anew with respect to such
additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso.
Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

(g) Other than in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, the Company
may, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date the
Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, but not after, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event (a " _Company
Intervening Event Recommendation Change_ ") if (i) the Company has complied
with its obligations under this _Section 6.3_ and (ii) prior to taking such
action, the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would constitute a violation of
the Company Board of DirectorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that prior to making such Company Intervening Event
Recommendation Change, (A) the Company has given Parent at least three
Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and
specifying the reasons therefor, including specifying in reasonable detail
the applicable Company Intervening

 



49  Event, (B) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated in good
faith with Parent and its Representatives during such notice period to enable
Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement and (C) following
the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall have
considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed
in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make a Company Intervening Event Recommendation Change would violate the
Company Board of DirectorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of
the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)(2)-(3) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder;
_provided_ , that no such action or disclosure that would amount to an Adverse
Recommendation Change shall be permitted, made or taken other than
in compliance with this _Section 6.3_.

Section 6.4 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") for so long as such Company
Employee remains employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation during such
period, (i) a base salary or base wage rate no less than that provided to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) through
the end of the CompanyÂ’s fiscal year 2017, target annual cash incentive
compensation no less favorable than that provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) long term incentives that are
comparable to the long term incentives provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and (iv) aggregate employee benefits
(excluding any equity-based compensation, defined benefit retirement benefits
and retiree welfare benefits) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries); _provided_ , that
for purposes of the foregoing sentence, the employee benefits (excluding any
equity based compensation defined benefit retirement benefits and retiree
welfare benefits) generally provided to employees of the Company as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be substantially
comparable, on an aggregate basis, to those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide for terms and conditions of
employment for any Company Employee in accordance with applicable Law.

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the Company
Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the service of
each Company Employee with the Company prior to the Closing Date for purposes

 



50  of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual under such Post-Closing Plans,
in each case, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior
to the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that such recognition of service shall not (i)
apply for purposes of any defined benefit retirement plan or plan that
provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Company Employee with respect to the same period of service, (iii) apply for
purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (A) under which
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive
credit for prior service or (B) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with
respect to level of benefits or participation. With respect to any Post-
Closing Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits, for
the plan year in which such Company Employee is first eligible to participate,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) cause any pre-existing
condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be
waived with respect to such Company Employee to the extent such limitation
would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (2) credit each Company Employee for an amount equal to any medical,
dental or vision expenses incurred by such Company Employee in the plan year
in which such Company Employee is first eligible to participate in such Post-
Closing Plan, for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-
pocket expense requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan to the extent
such expenses would have been credited under the Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Such credited expenses shall also count toward any annual or lifetime limits,
treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the terms of
the applicable plan. 

(c) (i) For annual bonuses in respect of calendar year 2016, (A) if Closing
occurs prior to December 31, 2016, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay each bonus-eligible Company Employee his or her annual
bonus at the greater of (I) the target level and (II) the actual level of
performance for such year, which bonus shall be paid at the time that
such annual bonus is normally paid in accordance with the CompanyÂ’s past
practice, and (B) if Closing occurs after December 31, 2016, either the
Company or Parent shall (or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
pay each bonus-eligible Company Employee his or her annual bonus based on the
actual level of performance for such year, which bonus shall be paid at the
time that such annual bonus is normally paid in accordance with the CompanyÂ’s
past practice. (ii) For the annual bonus in respect of calendar year 2017,
only if the Closing Date occurs after the end of the first quarter of 2017,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay each bonus-
eligible Company Employee his or her annual bonus at the greater of (A) the
target level and (B) the actual level of performance for such year, which
bonus shall be paid at the time that such annual bonus is normally paid in
accordance with the CompanyÂ’s past practice. For purposes of this
_Section 6.4(c)_ , the actual level of performance shall be calculated in
accordance with the CompanyÂ’s past practice; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
for bonuses in respect of the year in which the Closing occurs, any
performance criteria used may be equitably adjusted by the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board of Directors prior to the Closing to account
for any significant transaction expenses or integration costs (subject to an
aggregate cap of $60 million for all such adjustments); provided, further,
however, that the Company shall consult in good faith with Parent reasonably
in advance of making any such adjustments and the Company shall consider
ParentÂ’s input in good faith prior to making such adjustments.

 



51 (d) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide severance payments and benefits
to each Company Employee whose employment is terminated, on or before the
first (1st) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, under
circumstances that would otherwise give rise to rights to severance payments
and benefits under the terms and conditions of the Company Benefit Plans set
forth in _Section 6.4(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (but disregarding
any expiration date provided for in any such Company Benefit Plan) that are
no less favorable in the aggregate than those that would have been paid or
provided for pursuant to such plans.

 

(e) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms,
all Company Benefit Plans set forth in _Section 4.11(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, honor the terms of all works council, labor or collective
bargaining agreements by which the Company or its Subsidiaries are bound that
are in effect as of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms thereof.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge
or terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit
Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained
or sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other
compensation or benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement
after the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of  _Section 9.13_
and any provision in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing
in this _Section 6.4_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any
person other than the parties hereto, including any Company Employee or
current or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 6.5  _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

(a) Subject to _Section 6.5(b)_ , Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to submit all
notifications to and obtain all authorizations, consents, Orders and
approvals of all Governmental Entity that may be or become necessary for its
execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to,
this Agreement, (ii) cooperate fully in promptly submitting all notifications
and seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals
and (iii) provide such other information to any Governmental Entity as such
Governmental Entity may reasonably request in connection herewith. Each Party
agrees to make promptly (but in no event later than August 1, 2016) its
respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions

  



52  contemplated by this Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable to
the appropriate Governmental Entities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each
Party agrees to make as promptly as practicable its respective filings and
notifications, if any, under any other applicable antitrust, competition,
foreign investment or trade regulation Law and to supply as promptly
as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
applicable antitrust, competition, foreign investment or trade regulation Law.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of ParentÂ’s and the CompanyÂ’s undertakings
pursuant to _Section 6.5(a)_ , Parent and the Company shall take any and all
steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition, foreign investment or trade regulation Law that may be
asserted by any antitrust or competition Governmental Entity so as to enable
the parties hereto to close the Merger as promptly as practicable, and in any
event prior to the Long Stop Date, including proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such of its assets,
properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be
acquired by it pursuant hereto, and the entrance into such other arrangements,
as are necessary or advisable in order to avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain,
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as
soon as possible (and in any event before the Long Stop Date); _provided_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing shall obligate Parent or its Affiliates, or permit
the Company or its Affiliates, to offer, propose, take, negotiate, commit to,
effect or agree to take (or refrain or cause to refrain from taking any
action) or agree to, any actions contemplated by _Section 6.5(a)_ or this
_Section 6.5(b)_ if such action, individually or in the aggregate with all
other such actions taken together, would reasonably be expected to be material
to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the
Merger (assuming Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to the Merger, are the size of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, prior to giving effect to the Merger); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that no party hereto shall be required pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ to
commit to or effect any action that is not conditioned upon the consummation
of the Merger. In addition, in the event that any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any
Governmental Entity or by a private party challenging the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, in each case in accordance with this _Section 6.5_
, cooperate with each other in all respects and to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and defend on the merits any claim asserted
in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any decree, Order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would prevent the Closing prior to the Long Stop Date.

(c) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any communication
received from, or given by such Party or any of its Affiliates to, any
Governmental Entity or person relating to the matters that are the subject of
this Agreement and shall permit the other Party to review in advance any
proposed communication by such Party (and its advisors) to any Governmental
Entity. None of the Parties shall agree to participate in any substantive
meeting or conference, whether in person or by telephone, with any

 



53  Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation (including any
settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry unless it
consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. The Parties shall coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and
in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods, including
under the HSR Act. The Parties shall provide each other with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, (i) redact or remove references concerning
the valuation of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii)
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive or any confidential business
material provided to the other under this _Section 6.5(c)_ as "counsel only"
or, as appropriate, as "outside counsel only."

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that Parent shall control and direct, and the
Company will cooperate reasonably, subject to applicable Law, with such
direction and control, regarding the filings (including where to file),
strategies, process, negotiation of settlements (if any), and related
proceedings contemplated by this _Section 6.5_ , including for the avoidance
of doubt the marketing or sale of any part of the CompanyÂ’s businesses or
assets. Any reasonable actions or strategies pursued by Parent to avoid,
resist or reduce the scope of any action that may be sought or required to
satisfy the conditions in  _Section 7.1(c)_ or submit all required
notifications to or obtain the consent of any Governmental Entity shall be
deemed consistent with its reasonable best efforts obligations under this
_Section 6.5_ , so long as it does not delay satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ to a date beyond the Long Stop Date.

(e) Prior to the Closing, each of Parent and the Company (without limiting
_Section 6.1_ ) shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
a Contract to acquire or license, or acquire or license, any assets,
businesses or securities of a third party if such acquisition or license
would or would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay beyond the Long Stop
Date satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(b)_ and _(c)_.

 

Section 6.6 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Special Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(but in no event later than August 1, 2016), the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form. Parent shall
cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
furnish all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company will
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement,
will be made by the Company without providing Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and considering all such
comments in good faith. The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as
practicable of the receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the
SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the
SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall

 



54  supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and any
of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC,
on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement, at and from
the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company until the
Company Special Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior
to the Company Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof)
any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include a misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed by the Company with the
SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
resolution of any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to
the preliminary Proxy Statement (such date, the " _Clearance Date_ ").

(b) Subject to _Section 6.3(f)_ , the Company shall take all action necessary
in accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents
to set a record date for, duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
(the " _Company Special Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable following the
Clearance Date. Except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.3_ , the Company
Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall not make any Adverse
Recommendation Change and, unless the Company shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change if and to the extent permitted by this Agreement, shall
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall solicit,
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Company Stockholder
Approval at the Company Special Meeting (including by soliciting proxies in
favor of the adoption of the Merger and this Agreement and ensuring that all
proxies so solicited are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws and
the rules of the NYSE) and otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to the Company Special Meeting.

(c) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably
current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following
the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. The Company may
adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting only (i) if as of the time
which the Company Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Company Special Meeting or to the extent that
at such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) to allow time for the filing and
dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the
Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith

 



55  (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel) is necessary
or required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Law, the CompanyÂ’s
certificate of incorporation or the CompanyÂ’s bylaws or (iii) with the prior
written consent of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such adjournment
or postponement shall be for not more than, in the case of clause (i), ten
Business Days, and in the case of clause (ii), ten Business Days or such
other amount of time reasonably agreed by Company and Parent to be necessary
to comply with applicable Law, and, in any event, shall not be to a date that
is later than three Business Days prior to the Long Stop Date.

(d) During any such period of adjournment or postponement, the Company shall
continue in all respects to comply with its obligations under _Section 6.3_
and this _Section 6.6_. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the
adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that
the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at
the Company Special Meeting.

 

Section 6.7 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company shall not take any action that
would cause the Merger to be subject to requirements imposed by any takeover
statute. If any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or
regulation" or other similar state anti-takeover Laws and regulations may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Merger, the Company shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. The Parties shall consult
with one another prior to issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity
to review and comment upon, any public announcement, statement or
other disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not
issue any such public announcement or statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by Law, by the rules and regulations of the NYSE or
the Euronext Paris Exchange or in connection with an Adverse Recommendation
Change (in which case the Company shall provide to Parent a draft of such
public announcement or statement as far in advance as reasonably practicable);
_provided_ , that each of the Company and Parent may make any public
statements in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or
analyst or investor calls, so long as such statements are not inconsistent
with previous statements made jointly by the Company and Parent (or made by
one party after having consulted with the other party).

Section 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of any present and former director and officer of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively,
together with their respective heirs, executors and 

 



56  administrators, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the
Company Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational
Documents) or any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date
hereof and set forth on _Section 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Company Indemnified
Parties.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless
each Company Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or Liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or
occurring or actions or omissions taken prior to or at the Effective Time,
including with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, to the fullest extent
permitted by the Company Organizational Documents, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also
advance expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined by a final and nonappealable judicial
determination that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 6.9_ or otherwise.

 

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance maintained by the Company (
_provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies,
including a prepaid "tail" policy, with a substantially comparable insurer of
the same coverage and amounts containing substantially similar terms and
conditions) with respect to claims arising from facts or events, or actions or
omissions, which occurred or are alleged to have occurred at or before the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall
not be obligated to make annual premium payments, or in the case of a prepaid
"tail" policy, total premiums, for such insurance to the extent such premiums
exceed 300% of the premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for
such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at premiums equal to the Premium Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall have the right following reasonable consultation with
Parent to procure (and the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be deemed to have been satisfied in such case) a prepaid "tail" policy
conforming to the requirements of the preceding sentence, provided, however,
that the amount paid for such prepaid policies shall not exceed the Premium
Cap without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified
Parties, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such individual may have under the
Company Organizational Documents, by Contract or otherwise.

 



57 Section 6.10 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any PartyÂ’s
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other PartyÂ’s
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
respective operations.

 

Section 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the Merger by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 6.12 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives
to), use its and their respective reasonable best efforts to provide all
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in arranging, obtaining
and syndicating any third party Indebtedness for borrowed money to be raised
by Parent or its Subsidiaries or raising any equity financing by Parent, in
each case for the purpose of financing the aggregate Merger Consideration and
any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and all related fees and expenses of
Parent and Merger Sub (any such debt financing, the " _Debt Financing_ " and
any such equity financing, the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together with the
Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to), use its and their respective reasonable best efforts to
(i) upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, make
senior management, external auditors and advisors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries available to participate in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions with
proposed lenders, lead arrangers, initial purchasers, placement agents and/or
other agents, lenders or investors for the Financing, and in sessions with
rating agencies, (ii) provide reasonable assistance with the preparation of
customary materials (to the extent relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries) for lender and investor presentations, rating agency
presentations, confidential information memoranda, offering memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents customary or reasonably required in
connection with the Financing, including the marketing and syndication
thereof, in each case as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) on an
ongoing basis, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, furnish Parent
and its Financing Sources with (A) audited consolidated balance sheets and
related audited consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
stockholdersÂ’ equity and cash flows of the Company for each of the three (or
two in respect of audited consolidated balance sheets) most recently ended
fiscal years that have ended at least 60 days prior to the Effective Time
(and the audit reports for such financial statements shall not be subject to
any "going concern" qualifications); (B) unaudited

 



58  consolidated balance sheets and related unaudited consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, stockholdersÂ’ equity and cash flows of the
Company for each subsequent interim quarterly period that has ended at least
40 days prior to the Effective Time, in the case of each of clauses (A) and
(B), prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of the unaudited
statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of

required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,
the Company or Parent, as applicable, that discovers such information shall

best efforts to cooperate with such parties so selected. Notwithstanding the

of its Subsidiaries to Parent or any Financing Source for use in connection
with such Debt Offer or (ii) any fraud or Willful Breach by any such persons,
as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

the parties hereto that the Closing shall not be conditioned upon the
consummation of any Debt Offer.

(h) The provisions of _Section 6.13_ or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this _Section 6.13_ will (i)

8.1(g)_ , the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee
the Termination Fee immediately prior to or concurrently with, and as a
condition to the effectiveness of, such termination.

 

(d) " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $310,000,000.
Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, if the
Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this _Section
8.3_ , from and after such termination and payment of the Termination Fee in
full pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 8.3_ , the Company
shall have no further Liability of any kind for any reason in connection with
this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided
under this _Section 8.3_ except in the case of fraud. In no event
shall Parent or its designee be entitled to more than one payment of the
Termination Fee in connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to
which such Termination Fee is payable.

 

(e) If Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_ , the Company shall reimburse or cause to be reimbursed Parent or its
designee a cash amount of $40,000,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), by wire
transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds,
within one Business Day after such termination, for the fees and expenses
incurred by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub in connection with or related
to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and any filings or submissions in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that the
reimbursement by or on behalf of the Company of the Parent Expenses shall not
relieve the Company of any obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to 
_Section 8.3(a)_ , except to the extent specified in _Section 8.3(a)_.

 



68 (f) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that neither payment of the
Termination Fee nor reimbursement of the Parent Expenses is intended to be a
penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee or the
Parent Expenses are due and payable or reimburseable, as applicable, and
which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Merger, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner
any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ , then (i) the Company shall
reimburse Parent and its designee for all costs and expenses (including
disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of
such overdue amount, including in connection with any related claims, actions
or proceedings commenced and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent or its
designee interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such
amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate
set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made plus two percent.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf
of itself and its Subsidiaries, stockholders, Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees and Representatives) (in each case, with respect to such
stockholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives,
prior to the Closing of the Merger) hereby waives any rights or claims
against any Debt Financing Source (in their capacity as such) in connection
with this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing waiver, it is agreed that no Debt Financing Source (in their
capacity as such) shall have any liability for any claims, losses,
settlements, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses, fines or penalties to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, stockholders, Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and Representatives (in each case, with respect to such
stockholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives,
prior to the Closing of the Merger) in connection with this Agreement or the
Financing or the transactions contemplated thereby.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 9.1 _No Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Merger, except for covenants and agreements
which contemplate performance after the Effective Time or otherwise expressly
by their terms survive the Effective Time.

 

Section 9.2 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 6.12_ , _Section 6.13_
and _Section 8.3_ , whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring or required to incur such expenses.

 



69 Section 9.3 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument,
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the Parties and delivered (by telecopy, electronic delivery or
otherwise) to the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" form,
or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic
and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

 

Section 9.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

Section 9.5 _Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that it shall bring any
proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising in connection herewith, or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement
and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by any other party
hereto or its successors or assigns (" _Actions_ "), exclusively in (i) the
Delaware Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County, (ii) in the event
(but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such suit, action or other proceeding, the Delaware
Superior Court, (iii) in the event (but only in the event) such courts
identified in clauses (i) or (ii) do not have subject matter jurisdiction over
such suit, action or other proceeding, the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware or (iv) in the event (but only in the event) such
courts identified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) do not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such suit, action or other proceeding, any other Delaware
state court (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely in connection with Actions
(A) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts,
(B) irrevocably waives any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for any reason other than the failure to
serve in accordance with this _Section 9.5(a)_ and any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in the Chosen Courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), (C) irrevocably
submits to the exclusive venue of any such Action in the Chosen Courts and
waives any objection to laying venue in any such Action in the Chosen Courts
and (D) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum,
do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto or that this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party
agrees that a final judgment in any Action brought in the Chosen Courts shall
be conclusive and 

 



70  binding upon each of the parties and may be enforced in any other courts the
jurisdiction of which each of the parties is or may be subject, by suit upon
such judgment. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 9.7_ and agrees that
service made in such manner shall have the same legal force and effect as if
served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware. Nothing in
this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or were threatened to
be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that
may be available to it, including monetary damages, each of the Parties shall
be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement exclusively in the Chosen Courts, and all such rights and remedies
at law or in equity shall be cumulative, except as may be limited by _Section
8.3_. The Parties further agree that no Party to this Agreement shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 9.5_ ; and each Party waives any objection to the imposition of such
relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

(c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each of the Parties to
this Agreement agrees that (i) it will not bring or support any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against
the Debt Financing Sources and their respective current, former or
future directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
members, managers, controlling persons, affiliates, employees or advisors (in
each case in their capacity as a Debt Financing Source or such a director,
officer, general or limited partner, stockholder, member, manager,
controlling person, affiliate, employee or advisor of a Debt Financing
Source), in each case, that are not parties hereto, in any way relating to
this Agreement or the Merger, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Commercial Court of Paris ( _Tribunal de Commerce de
Paris_ ) and (ii) any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of
France.

 

Section 9.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER (INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FINANCING).

 

Section 9.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be
in writing in one of the following formats and shall be deemed given (a) upon
actual delivery if personally delivered to the Party to be notified; (b) when
sent if sent by email or facsimile to the Party to be notified; _provided_ ,

_Section 9.7_ and

 



71  (ii) either (A) a duplicate copy of such email or facsimile notice is
promptly given by one of the other methods described in this _Section 9.7_ or
(B) the receiving Party delivers a written confirmation of receipt for such
notice either by email (excluding "out of office" or similar automated

_9.7_ ; or (c) when delivered if sent by a courier (with confirmation of
delivery); in each case to the Party to be notified at the following address:

72 or to such other address as any Party shall specify by written notice so
given. Any Party to this Agreement may notify any other Party of any changes
to the address or any of the other details specified in this paragraph;
_provided_ , that such notification shall only be effective on the date
specified in such notice or three Business Days after the notice is given,
whichever is later. Rejection or other refusal to accept or the inability to
deliver because of changed address of which no notice was given shall be
deemed to be receipt of the notice as of the date of such rejection,
refusal or inability to deliver.

Section 9.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated
by any of the Parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
Parties; _provided_ , that each of Merger Sub and Parent may assign any of
their rights hereunder to a wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of
Parent upon prior written notice to the Company, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the first sentence of this _Section 9.8_ , this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
_Section 9.8_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 9.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

Section 9.10  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the exhibits
hereto, schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the Parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof, and this Agreement is not intended to
grant standing to any person other than the Parties hereto.

 

Section 9.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub; _provided_ , that this
proviso to this _Section 9.11_ and _Sections 8.3(g)_ , _9.4_ ,  _9.5(c)_ ,
_9.6_ and _9.13_ may not be amended or waived in a manner adverse to the Debt
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing
Sources that are party to a commitment letter with Parent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). At any time and from
time to time prior to the Effective Time, either the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may, to the extent not prohibited
by applicable Law and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Merger Sub, in the case of an extension by the Company, or of the Company, in
the case of an extension by Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of any
such Party contained herein. The foregoing notwithstanding, no failure or
delay by any Party hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

 



73 Section 9.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 9.13 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company agrees that (a) their respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other Party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, and (b) except for the provisions of _Section 6.9_ , this
Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other than
the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to
rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
foregoing notwithstanding, each Debt Financing Source shall be an express
third party beneficiary of and shall be entitled to rely upon _Section 8.3(g)_
, _Section 9.4, Section 9.5(c)_ , _Section 9.6_ , the proviso to the first
sentence of  _Section 9.11_ and this _Section 9.13_ , and each Debt Financing
Source may enforce such provisions.

Section 9.14  _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. The word "since" when used
in this Agreement in reference to a date shall be deemed to be inclusive of
such date. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such term. All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to
U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term
"or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. References in this Agreement to
specific laws or to specific provisions of laws shall include all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and any statute defined or referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument referred to herein shall mean such
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including by
succession of comparable successor statutes. Each of the Parties has
participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must
be construed as if it is drafted by all the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
