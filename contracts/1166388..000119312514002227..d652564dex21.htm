per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_
") that is owned by the Company or its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, Parent or
Merger Sub and each share of Preferred Stock that is owned by the Company or
its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, Parent or Merger Sub shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(c)  _Options_. The Company shall cause all outstanding Options to be
canceled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, at which time each
holder of a Vested Option (an " _Optionholder_ ") shall, contingent upon the
Closing, become entitled to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(in lieu of receiving any stock of the Company) an amount in cash (adjusted
down to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if
any, of the Common Share Price over the applicable exercise price per share
of such Vested Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock
such Optionholder could have purchased if such Optionholder had exercised such
Vested Option in full immediately prior to such time, less applicable Taxes
withheld (it being understood that the portion paid at Closing will be based
on the Estimated Common Share price). Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to make timely payment to the appropriate taxing authority or
authorities of any amounts withheld from payment to the Optionholders under
this _Section 3.1(c)_. The aggregate consideration to which Optionholders
become entitled pursuant to this _Section 3.1(c)_ is collectively referred
to herein as the " _Option Merger Consideration._ " As soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver a
notice to each of the Optionholders substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Optionholder Notice_ "). Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall adopt board (or committee) resolutions resolving that, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (a) no Person shall have any right
under the Options, the Kay Technology Holdings, Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive
Plan (the " _Equity Plan_ ") or any other plan, program, agreement or
arrangement with respect to equity securities of the Surviving Corporation or
any direct or indirect Subsidiary thereof, except the right to receive the
amounts payable under this _Section 3.1(c)_, if any, (b) the Equity Plan
terminates and (c) each Option (i) for which the exercise price of such
Option is greater than or equal to the Estimated Common Share Price or (ii) is
an Unvested Option, in each case is terminated for no consideration.

 

(d) _Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock_. Each issued and outstanding
share of Series A Preferred Stock (other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_, if any, and the Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive cash equal to the Series A Share Price
(the " _Series A Merger Consideration_ ").

 



15 (e) _Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock_. In respect of all issued,
outstanding and vested (as determined by the terms of the Duffell Restricted
Stock Purchase Agreement) shares of Series B Preferred Stock (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_, if any, and the
Dissenting Shares) held by the Series B Preferred Stockholder, all such
Series B Preferred Stock in the aggregate shall be converted into the right to
receive (adjusted down to the nearest whole cent) (i) cash equal to the Series
B Percentage _multiplied by_ the Estimated Residual Merger Consideration (the
" _Series B Merger Consideration_ ") and (ii) any amounts payable in respect
of the Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to the Post-Closing Adjustments. Any
share of Series B Preferred Stock which will not become vested as a result of
the Transactions shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist.

 

(f) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Common
Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with  _Section 3.1(b)_
or cancelled or repurchased in accordance with _Section 3.5_, if any, and the
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive cash (adjusted
down to the nearest whole cent) equal to the Common Share Price (in the
aggregate, the " _Common Stock Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the
Series A Merger Consideration, the Series B Merger Consideration and the
Option Merger Consideration, including without duplication if already
covered, any amounts payable pursuant to the Post-Closing Adjustments, the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(g) _No More Rights_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series
B Preferred Stock or Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ "), shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto except the right to receive the Series A
Merger Consideration, the Series B Merger Consideration and any amounts
payable pursuant to any Post-Closing Adjustments or the Common Stock Merger
Consideration, as the case may be.

3.2 _Notices to Stockholders; Dissenting Shares_.

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, mail or deliver (i) to each Stockholder (A) a letter from the Company
providing such Stockholder with a brief information statement regarding the
Company and the Transactions, providing (I) the notification required by
Section 228(e) of the DGCL with respect to the Written Consent and (II)
notice in the manner contemplated in Section 262 of the DGCL of such holders
right to seek appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and (B) a Letter
of Transmittal, in the form of  _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and (ii) to each Optionholder, the Optionholder Notice. The
Company shall afford Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon the documents described in this _Section 3.2(a)_ and shall consider in
good faith Parents comments thereto. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, in no event shall any Stockholder have the right to receive any
payment to which such Person is otherwise entitled pursuant to this _Article
III_ unless and until such time as such Person delivers to the Surviving
Corporation a duly executed and completed copy of the Letter of Transmittal
and one or more certificates, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by duly
executed stock powers, representing the number of shares of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock, as applicable, held by such holder as of immediately before
the Effective Time or affidavits of loss in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

(b) Within ten days after the Effective Date, the Surviving Corporation shall
notify each Stockholder who has complied with Section 262 and not voted in
favor of or consented to the Merger that the Merger has become effective.

 



16 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
share of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a Stockholder who shall have
not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall
have properly demanded appraisal for such share in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Common Stock Merger
Consideration, the Series A Merger Consideration or the Series B Merger
Consideration, as applicable, or any portion thereof, in respect of such
Dissenting Share unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively
withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. Such
Stockholder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such share of Common Stock or Preferred Stock in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that any Dissenting Share
held by a Stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively
shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost his, her or its rights to appraisal of
such share of Common Stock or Preferred Stock under such Section 262 of the
DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive the
consideration set forth in _Sections 3.1_ and _3.3(a)(i)_ , without any
interest thereon.

 

(d) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by
the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle
any such demand.

 

3.3 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Closing Payments_. Subject to compliance with _Section 3.3(b)_, at
Closing, Parent shall (i) pay to the Paying Agent for the benefit of each
Common Stockholder the Estimated Common Share Price in respect of each share
of Common Stock held by such Common Stockholder, (ii) pay to the Paying Agent
for the benefit of each Series A Preferred Stockholder the Series A Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock held by
such Series A Preferred Stockholder, (iii) pay to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the Series B Preferred Stockholder the Series B Merger
Consideration in respect of all Series B Preferred Stock in the aggregate
held by the Series B Preferred Stockholder, and (iv) pay, or cause the
Surviving Corporation pay, to each Optionholder the applicable portion of the
Option Merger Consideration due in respect of each Vested Option held by such
Optionholder as determined by _Section 3.1(c)_. Following receipt of the
payments set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) above, such amounts shall be
distributed as soon as practicable by the Paying Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of each Series A Preferred
Stockholder, Series B Preferred Stockholder and Common Stockholder, as
applicable.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates
representing the Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred
Stock held by each Stockholder to the Company (or an affidavit of loss in
accordance with _Section 3.3(e)_ below), together with a duly executed Letter
of Transmittal, such Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, the Estimated Common Share Price, Series A Merger
Consideration or Series B Merger Consideration for the Common Stock, Series A
Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, respectively, represented
by such Certificate or Certificates, and Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation shall make
such payment to each such Stockholder immediately after the Effective Time if
such Stockholder has surrendered his, her or its Certificates, duly endorsed
in blank or accompanied by duly executed stock powers (or an affidavit of loss
in accordance with _Section 3.3(e)_ below) and a duly executed and completed
Letter of Transmittal at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ _3.3(b)_ ,

 



17  each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration, and neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to pay the holder thereof the cash to which he, she or it would
otherwise have been entitled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, upon the occurrence of the Closing, payments of
Merger Consideration to the Stockholders hereunder shall be made by the Paying
Agent pursuant to that certain Paying Agent Agreement, by and among the
Company, Parent, the Representative and Wilmington Trust, National
Association, substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock or Preferred Stock_. All
cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates (including cash deposited in the
Representative Account and the Adjustment Escrow Account) in accordance with
the terms of this  _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock, as applicable, previously represented by such Certificates.
From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

 

(d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the providing of an
indemnity by such Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Surviving Corporation will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration for the Common Stock or Preferred Stock represented by such
Certificate to which such holder would be entitled pursuant to this _Article
III_.

 

(f) _Executive Promissory Notes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the proceeds payable by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to any
Stockholder or Optionholder pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the
aggregate principal and accrued interest of any Executive Promissory Notes
issued by such Stockholder or Optionholder which remain outstanding as of the
Closing.

3.4 _Company Indebtedness_. Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent shall
repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
any outstanding amount of Closing Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries by wire transfer of immediately available funds as directed by
the holders of such Closing Indebtedness at least three (3) Business Days
before the Closing. The Company shall deliver to Parent at the Closing
customary payoff letters in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent in respect of repayment of the Closing Indebtedness, together with
UCC-3 termination statements or similar documents evidencing the termination
of all Liens securing any Closing Indebtedness. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause, as of the Closing, each of the letters of
credit of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be returned to the issuers
thereof, provide to the issuer of such letter of credit a letter of credit in
the same amount, in form reasonably satisfactory to the issuers of such
letters of credit, or otherwise reasonably secure the issuers of such letters
of credit as its continuing exposure with respect to such letters of credit
under the applicable credit facilities (e.g., cash collateralizing such
obligations).

 



18 3.5 _Unvested Share Repurchase or Cancellation_. Prior to the Effective Time,
any unvested " _Executive Shares_ " (as defined in the Duffell Restricted
Stock Purchase Agreement) shall be automatically cancelled by the Company, and
the Company shall pay to Mark Duffell the original cost of each such unvested
Executive Share. 

3.6 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow
Agent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
payment of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to a Common Stockholder,
Series A Preferred Stockholder, Series B Preferred Stockholder
or Optionholder pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; provided
that, if the Parent, Merger Sub, Paying Agent or Escrow Agent determines that
an amount is required to be deducted and withheld with respect to any such
payment (other than a compensatory payment, which may be withheld upon without
notice), at least three (3) days prior to the date the applicable payment is
scheduled to be made, the Parent will provide the Company with written notice
of the intent to deduct and withhold, which shall include a copy of the
calculation of the amount to be deducted and withheld and any applicable
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law pursuant to which such
deduction and withholding is required and provide the recipient of such
payment a reasonable opportunity for such recipient to provide forms or
other evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

3.7 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, to be used in accordance with _Section 3.7(e)_. Any amounts to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to this _Section 3.7(a)_ shall be
deposited in an escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ ") to be
established and maintained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms hereof
and an escrow agreement, substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ (the "
_Adjustment Escrow Agreement_ "), to be entered into by Parent, the
Representative and the Escrow Agent prior to the date of such deposit. The
Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be allocated to each Series B Stockholder,
Common Stockholder and Optionholder in accordance with their respective
Allocation Percentages.

(b) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Company Statement_ ") prepared in
good faith setting forth (i) an estimate of Net Working Capital (such amount,
the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) an estimate of Cash on Hand
(such amount, the " _Estimated Cash on Hand_ "), (iii) an estimate of
Indebtedness (such amount, the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (iv) an estimate
of the Transaction Costs (such amount, the " _Estimated Transaction Costs_
"), (v) an estimate of Pre-Closing Taxes, excluding any amounts relating to
the items set forth on _Schedule 9.1(a)(iv)_ (such amount, the " _Estimated
Pre-Closing Taxes_ ") and (vi) the resulting calculation of Estimated
Residual Merger Consideration. The Company Statement and the components
thereof (including Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness, Estimated
Pre-Closing Taxes and Transaction Costs) shall each be determined
in accordance with this Agreement, the defined terms herein and past
practice.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date (the " _Parent Closing Statement Date_ "), Parent shall
prepare in good faith and shall deliver to the Representative a statement (the
" _Parent Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the actual amounts of (i) Net
Working Capital (such amount as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
3.7_, the " _Final Net Working_

 



19   _Capital_ "), (ii) Cash on Hand (such amount as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 3.7_, the " _Final Cash on Hand_ "), (iii)
Indebtedness (such amount as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
3.7_, the " _Final Indebtedness_ "), (iv) Transaction Costs (such amount as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 3.7_, the " _Final Transaction
Costs_ "), (v) Pre-Closing Taxes, excluding any amounts relating to the items
set forth on _Schedule 9.1(a)(iv)_ (such amount as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 3.7_, the " _Final Pre-Closing Taxes_ ") and (vi) the
resulting calculation of Final Residual Merger Consideration; _provided_ that
if Parent fails to deliver the Parent Closing Statement by the Closing
Statement Date and Parent has not delivered the Parent Closing Statement
within five (5) Business Days after Representative has delivered notice of
such failure, Representative may instruct Escrow Agent to release the
Adjustment Escrow Amount (and Parent hereby agrees to such instruction and
waives any objection to such release). The Parent Closing Statement and the
components thereof (including Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness,
Final Pre-Closing Taxes and Transaction Costs) shall each be determined in
accordance with this Agreement, the defined terms herein and past practice.
The parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Parent Closing Statement
and determining Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness, Final Pre-
Closing Taxes and Transaction Costs and the related purchase price
adjustments contemplated by this _Section 3.7_ is to measure changes in Net
Working Capital and the levels of Cash on Hand, Indebtedness, Estimated and
Final Pre-Closing Taxes and Transaction Costs, and such processes are not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Parent Closing
Statement or determining Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness,
Estimated or Final Pre-Closing Taxes and Transaction Costs. After delivery of
the Parent Closing Statement, Parent shall give the Representative and its
accountants reasonable access during normal business hours to review
Parents, the Surviving Corporations and its Subsidiaries books and records
directly related to and utilized in, and employees involved in, the
preparation of the Parent Closing Statement. The Representative and its
accountants may make inquires of Parent and its Subsidiaries regarding
questions concerning or disagreements with the Parent Closing Statement
arising in the course of its review thereof, and Parent shall use its, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such employees to cooperate with and promptly respond to such
inquiries. If the Representative has any objections to the Parent Closing
Statement, the Representative shall deliver to Parent a statement setting
forth its objections thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If an Objections
Statement is not delivered to Parent within 30 days after delivery of the
Parent Closing Statement, the Parent Closing Statement shall be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The Representative and
Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if
they do not reach a final resolution within 15 days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement, the Representative and Parent shall submit such dispute
to a mutually acceptable dispute resolution firm (the " _Dispute Resolution
Firm_ "). Any further submissions to the Dispute Resolution Firm must be
written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The Dispute Resolution
Firm shall consider only those items and amounts which are identified in the
Objections Statement as being items which the Representative and Parent are
unable to resolve. The Dispute Resolution Firms determination will be based
solely on the definitions of Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness,
Estimated and Final Pre-Closing Taxes and Transaction Costs, as applicable,
contained herein. The Representative and Parent shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Firm to resolve all
disagreements as soon as practicable and in any event within 60 days after the
submission of any dispute. Further, the Dispute Resolution Firms
determination shall be based solely on the submissions by Parent and the
Representative which are in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth
in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review or an
audit). The resolution of the dispute by the Dispute Resolution Firm shall be
final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto. The costs and
expenses of the Dispute Resolution Firm shall be allocated based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually contested by such party in the presentation
to the Dispute Resolution Firm. For example, if the Representative submits an
Objections Statement for $1,000, and if Parent contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by the Representative, and

 



20  if the Dispute Resolution Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding
the Representative $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of
the Dispute Resolution Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e. 300/500) to Parent
and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Representative.

(d) If the Final Residual Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Residual
Merger Consideration (such excess, the " _Excess Amount_ "), then, promptly
following the determination of the Final Residual Merger Consideration, and in
any event within five (5) Business Days thereof, (I) Parent shall pay (x) to
the Paying Agent the portion of such Excess Amount owed to the Series B
Stockholder and the Common Stockholders, determined in accordance with their
respective Allocation Percentages and (y) to the Optionholders, in accordance
with their relative respective Allocation Percentages, the remainder of such
Excess Amount (less applicable withholding taxes), through the Surviving
Corporations or one of its Subsidiaries payroll systems or otherwise and
(II) the Representative and Parent shall deliver joint instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the entire Adjustment Escrow
Amount as follows: (i) to the Paying Agent the portion of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount owed to the Series B Stockholder and the Common
Stockholders, determined in accordance with their respective Allocation
Percentages and (ii) to Parent (on behalf of the Optionholders) the remainder
of such Adjustment Escrow Amount, for further payment by Parent or the
Surviving Corporations or one of its Subsidiaries payroll systems or
otherwise to the Optionholders, in accordance with their relative respective
Allocation Percentages. The Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Series B
Stockholder and the Common Stockholders, in accordance with their respective
Allocation Percentages, the amounts received on their behalf, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated in
writing by the Representative.

(e) If the Estimated Residual Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Residual
Merger Consideration (such excess, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), then,
promptly following the determination of the Final Residual Merger
Consideration, and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereof, (I)
Parent and the Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to
Parent from the Adjustment Escrow Amount, the Shortfall Amount and (II) the
Representative and Parent shall deliver joint instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to pay (A) to the Paying Agent the portion of
the remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount, if any, owed to the Series B
Stockholder and the Common Stockholders, determined in accordance with their
respective Allocation Percentages and (B) to Parent (on behalf of the
Optionholders) the remainder of such Adjustment Escrow Amount, if any, for
further payment by Parent or the Surviving Corporations or one of its
Subsidiaries payroll systems or otherwise to the Optionholders,
in accordance with their relative respective Allocation Percentages. The
Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Series B Stockholder and the Common
Stockholders, in accordance with their respective Allocation Percentages, the
amounts received on their behalf, if any, pursuant to this _Section 3.7(e)_,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated in writing by the Representative.

 

(f) If the Adjustment Escrow Amount is not sufficient to satisfy the Shortfall
Amount, then, at Parents sole discretion, Parent shall be entitled to assert
on a dollar-for-dollar basis pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_ (subject to
the Representative Cap but not the Deductible as set forth in _Article IX_ )
against the Representative (in its capacity as such), in respect of all or
part of the amount by which the Shortfall Amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow
Amount (the " _Adjustment Escrow Deficiency Amount_ ").

 

3.8 _Representative Holdback_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the
Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds (to an
account designated by the Representative), an amount equal to $30,000,000 (the
" _Representative Holdback Amount_ "), to be used in accordance with this
_Section 3.8_ and as the source for any Representative Indemnification (but
subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the limitations contained in _Article
IX_ ). Any amounts to be deposited with the

 



21  Representative pursuant to this _Section 3.8_ shall be deposited in a
segregated account (the " _Representative Account_ ") to be established and
maintained by the Representative pursuant to the terms hereof. The portion of
the Representative Holdback Amount delivered to, and held by, the
Representative on behalf of each such Stockholder and Optionholder shall be
allocated to each Series B Stockholder, Common Stockholder and Optionholder
in accordance with their respective Allocation Percentages. The Representative
is entitled to pay on behalf of the Stockholders, Optionholders and, if
applicable, the Representative, and to the extent paid by the Representative
from its own funds, obtain reimbursement for, (x) costs and expenses incurred
by the Representative in the performance of its duties hereunder (whether
prior to or after the Closing) (" _Representative Expenses_ ") and (y) any
payment by the Representative with respect to any claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Article IX_ (the " _Representative Indemnification_ "), in each
case, from the Representative Holdback Amount. On or after May 1, 2015 (or
earlier pursuant to the final sentence of this _Section 3.8_), the
Representative may distribute portions, if any, of the Representative Holdback
Amount to each Series B Stockholder, Common Stockholder and Optionholder in
accordance with their respective Allocation Percentages, except that, subject
to the final sentence of this _Section 3.8_, no such distribution shall cause
the balance of the Representative Account to be less than (i) at any time
prior to April 30, 2015, the Representative Cap or (ii) at any time on or
after April 30, 2015, the sum of (x) an amount equal to all pending claims for
Representative Indemnification and (y) the Representative Cap (as reduced
from time to time pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_), provided that such sum shall
not exceed the initial Representative Cap. Upon the final resolution of all
claims for Representative Indemnification pending as of February 4, 2017 (or
earlier pursuant to the final sentence of this _Section 3.8_), the remaining
portion of the Representative Holdback Amount (if any) shall be distributed to
each Series B Stockholder, Common Stockholder and Optionholder in accordance
with their respective Allocation Percentages. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Representative (x) may earlier distribute such amounts if it receives
satisfactory credit worthy assurances (determined in its sole discretion but
which may include letters of credit or the like) that such recipients will
return such funds if necessary to cover Representative Indemnification and/or
Representative Expenses (it being understood that such amounts may be
distributed on a non-pro rata basis absent such assurances) and (y) without
limiting the foregoing, may distribute up to $5,000,000 at any time in its
sole discretion.

 _TERMINATION_

4.1  _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time as follows:

(a) at the election of the Company or Parent on or after February 28, 2014
(the " _Outside Date_ "), if the Merger shall not have occurred by the close
of business on such date, _provided_ , _however_ , that if on February 28,
2014, the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section
8.2(f)_ shall have not been satisfied or waived by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, but all other conditions to Closing have been satisfied (or, in
the case of conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
shall be capable of being satisfied on February 28, 2014), then the Outside
Date shall, at the option of Parent or the Company, as the
applicable beneficiary of such condition under _Article VIII_ , be extended
to and including March 30, 2014, if the party desiring to extend the Outside
Date notifies the other party in writing on or prior to February 28, 2014 to
so extend the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that (x) neither the
Company nor Parent may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
4.1(a)_ if it is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder and
such material breach causes, or results in, either (i) the failure to satisfy
the conditions to the obligations of the terminating party to consummate the
Merger set forth in _Article VIII_ prior to the Outside Date, or (ii) the
failure of the Effective Time to have occurred prior to the Outside Date and
(y) the Parent may not terminate pursuant to this _Section 4.1(a)_ if the
conditions to Closing contained in _Section 8.1_ have been satisfied (or are
expected to be satisfied at the Closing and are then capable of being
satisfied);

 



22 (b) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

(c) by the Company or Parent if there shall be in effect a final nonappealable
Order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, it being agreed that
the party so requesting termination shall have used commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly appeal any adverse determination that is not nonappealable
and shall have diligently pursued such appeal; _provided_ that neither the
Company nor Parent may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
4.1(c)_ if the issuance of such Order was caused by or resulting from the
material breach of such Persons obligations under this Agreement;

 

(d) by the Company or Parent if there is any statute, rule, regulation or
order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger or
the Transactions by any Governmental Body that would make the consummation of
the Merger or any of the other Transactions illegal;

 

(e) by Parent if the Company shall be in material breach of any of its
representations and warranties hereunder and such breach (if curable) is not
cured within ten (10) Business Days after the giving of written notice by
Parent to the Company and if not cured at or before Closing, such breach would
result in the failure of the condition set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_
being satisfied by the Outside Date;

(f) by Parent if the Company shall be in material breach of any of its
covenants hereunder, and if such violation (if curable) is not cured within
ten (10) Business Days after the giving of written notice by Parent to the
Company and if not cured at or before Closing, such breach would result in the
failure of the condition set forth in  _Section 8.1(b)_ being satisfied by
the Outside Date;

(g) by the Company if Parent or Merger Sub shall be in material breach of any
of their representations and warranties hereunder and such breach (if curable)
is not cured within ten (10) Business Days after the giving of written notice
by the Company to Parent and if not cured at or before Closing, such
breach would result in the failure of the condition set forth in _Section
8.2(a)_ being satisfied by the Outside Date;

(h) by the Company if Parent or Merger Sub shall be in material breach of any
of their covenants hereunder, and if such violation (if curable) is not cured
within ten (10) Business Days after the giving of written notice by the
Company to Parent and if not cured at or before Closing, such breach would
result in the failure of the condition set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_ being
satisfied by the Outside Date; or

 

(i) by Parent if the Written Consent is not executed and delivered to Parent
within three (3) Business Days following the execution of this Agreement;
_provided_ _that_ , the right to terminate the Agreement under this _Section
4.1(i)_ must be exercised, if exercisable, by the tenth (10th) Business Day
after the date of this Agreement.

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may
Parent terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 4.1(a)_ ,  _4.1(e)_ or
_4.1(f)_ above if Parent is then in breach of the representation and warranty
in _Section 6.6_.

4.2  _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination and
abandonment by Parent or the Company, or both, pursuant to _Section 4.1_
hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or
parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and the Merger shall be
abandoned, without further action by Parent or the Company.

 



23 4.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Section 4.1_, then each of the parties shall
be relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after
the date of such termination and such termination shall be without liability
to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Common Stockholders or the Preferred
Stockholders; except that the provisions of this _Section 4.3_, _Section
7.6_ (Confidentiality) and _Article X_ (Miscellaneous) shall remain in full
force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their terms. No such termination shall relieve (i) any party hereto from
liability for any willful breach of this Agreement and (ii) Parent from any
liability for Losses to the Stockholder Parties (or the Company) for any
failure to fund or close the Transactions for any reason if the conditions to
Closing contained in _Section 8.1_ have been satisfied (or are expected to be
satisfied at the Closing and are then capable of being satisfied) (an "
_Impermissible Failure to Close_ "), regardless of whether or not such breach
was willful. The Parent Parties liability for any Impermissible Failure to
Close shall (1) not include any Losses for punitive damages (except to the
extent paid to a third party) or damages based on a "multiple of profits" or
"multiple of cash flows", (2) include damages for diminution in value, if any,
and (3) be limited to an aggregate maximum amount of damages paid to the
Company, the Representative, the Stockholder Parties, or any other person
permitted to claim under this Agreement, of $150,000,000 (it being understood
that the Company has the ability to seek damages on behalf of the
Stockholders and/or Optionholders in the event of an Impermissible Failure to
Close (but, for the avoidance of doubt, while these provisions shall not limit
specific performance, the Company may not seek both specific performance and
such damages simultaneously (although such may be sought sequentially to the
extent unsuccessful with respect to the first remedy sought)) and it being
understood that the Company shall not be prohibited from seeking fees, costs
and expenses as contemplated by _Section 10.15_). The Parent Parties shall
have no liability for an Impermissible Failure to Close if the debt Financing
Sources articulate in writing that the Companys material restatement
(undertaken in the Companys sole discretion) of any of the Financial
Statements was the primary cause for its failure to fund. The Company and the
Stockholder Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid taking
any action intended to increase the amount of any Losses arising in
connection with an Impermissible Failure to Close for which the Company (on
behalf of the Stockholders and/or Optionholders) may wish to seek damages;
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholder Parties shall
have no obligation to (but may in their sole discretion) sell the Company to
mitigate or establish such Losses.

Company is duly qualified or authorized to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing (or its equivalent) under the laws of
each jurisdiction in which its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct
of its business as now conducted requires such qualification or authorization,
except where the failure to be so qualified, authorized or in good standing

Parent prior to the date hereof a true and complete copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, each as amended to date (together,
the " _Company Charter Documents_ "), and each such instrument is in full
force and effect. The Company is not in violation in any material respect of
any of the provisions of the Company Charter Documents.

under the Company Documents. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Company Documents and the consummation of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company,
except for obtaining the Written Consent. The Written Consent is the only
vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock required in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions under the DGCL and the
Company Charter Documents, and no other corporate proceeding is necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
Company Documents. This Agreement has been, and each of the Company Documents
will be at or prior to the Closing, duly and validly executed and delivered
by the Company and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
the other parties hereto and thereto) this Agreement constitutes, and each
Company Document when so executed and delivered will constitute, the legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against it in
accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors rights and
remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles
of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and
fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at
law or in equity).

thereafter modified or rescinded) by unanimous vote (with no abstentions) at
a meeting duly called and held or by unanimous written consent, has (a)
approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, (b) determined
that this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Merger and
the Transactions are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and
its Stockholders, and (c) recommended that the Stockholders adopt this
Agreement.

 

(c) The Company, prior to the Effective Time, will have notified the
Stockholders of the Transactions as and to the extent required by the terms

herein. The information furnished to the Stockholders in the Letter of
Transmittal did not contain, and will not contain, at or prior to the
Effective Time, any untrue statement of a material fact and will not omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which made, not false or

whole, none of the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or
the Company Documents, the consummation of the Transactions, or compliance by

of termination or cancellation under, require any notice, consent or waiver
under, require the payment of a penalty or increased liabilities or fees or
the loss of a benefit under or result in the imposition of any Lien (other

properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary are bound.

execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Company Documents or the
compliance by the Company and its Subsidiaries with any of the provisions
hereof or thereof, or the consummation of the Transactions, except for (i)

Law enforced by any Governmental Body regarding preacquisition notifications
for the purpose of competition reviews), and (ii) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and

5.4 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 120,000,000
shares of Common Stock, (ii) 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
(iii) 5,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and (iv) 5,000 shares of
undesignated preferred stock. As of the date hereof, there are (i)
116,205,638.036 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, (ii)
91,327.375 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, and
(iii) 1,000.000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding,
none of which are held by the Company as treasury stock or by any Subsidiary.
A list of all holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock together with the
number of shares held by each such holder, in each case as of the date hereof,
is set forth on _Schedule 5.4(a)_ , and each such holder holds good, valid and
marketable title to such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as
applicable, free and clear of all Liens other than restrictions on transfer
under applicable federal and state securities Laws. There are no holders of
capital stock of the Company other than as set forth on _Schedule 5.4(a)_.
All of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock
were duly authorized for issuance and are validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and were not issued in violation of any purchase or call option,
right of first refusal, subscription right, preemptive right or any similar
rights. There are no accrued or unpaid dividends with respect to any issued
and outstanding shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that will not be
satisfied by the payment of the Merger Consideration hereunder.

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.4(b)_ and other than the Options set
forth on _Schedule 5.4(c)_ as of the date hereof, there is no existing option,
warrant, call, right, or Contract of any character to which the Company is a
party requiring, and there are no securities of the Company outstanding
that upon conversion, exercise or exchange would require, the issuance of any
shares of capital stock of the Company or other securities convertible into,
exchangeable for or evidencing the right to subscribe for, purchase or receive
shares of capital stock of the Company. Except as set forth on _Schedule
5.4(b)_ and other than the Options set forth on _Schedule 5.4(c)_ , the
Company is not a party to, or otherwise subject to, any voting trust, proxy or

thereof, the date of grant, the exercise price per share, the applicable
vesting schedule, and the expiration date thereof. Each Option was issued with
an exercise price for purposes of Section 409A of the Code that is no less
than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant and is
exempt from Section 409A of the Code.

owned by each equity

 



26  owner. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.5(a)_ , neither the Company nor

any Person that is not a Subsidiary of the Company. Each Subsidiary is a duly
organized and validly existing corporation or other entity in good standing
(or its equivalent) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified or authorized to do business
as a foreign corporation or entity and is in good standing (or its equivalent)
under the laws of each jurisdiction in which its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business as now conducted requires
such qualification or authorization, except where the failure to be so
qualified, authorized or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each Subsidiary has all requisite corporate or entity power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and carry on its business
as now conducted, except for such matters that would not be material to the
operations of such Subsidiary.

 

(b) The outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests of each
Subsidiary are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and all such
shares or other equity interests represented as being owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company and its Subsidiaries are owned free and clear of
any and all Liens (other than Permitted Exceptions) and were not issued in
violation of any purchase or call option, right of first refusal,
subscription right, preemptive right or any similar rights, except as set
forth on _Schedule 5.5(b)_. No shares of capital stock are held by any
Subsidiary as treasury stock. There is no existing option, warrant, call,
right or Contract of any character to which any Subsidiary is a party
requiring, and there are no securities of the Company or any Subsidiary
outstanding that upon conversion, exercise or exchange would require,
the issuance of any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any
Subsidiary or other securities convertible into, exchangeable for or
evidencing the right to subscribe for, purchase or receive shares of capital
stock or other equity interests of any Subsidiary. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 5.5(b)_ , no Subsidiary is party to, or otherwise subject to, any
voting trust, proxy or other Contract with respect to the voting, redemption,
repurchase, sale, transfer or other disposition of the shares of capital
stock or other equity interests of any Subsidiary.

(c) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
charter and by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of each
Subsidiary of the Company (the " _Subsidiary Charter Documents_ "), and each
such instrument is in full force and effect. None of the Subsidiaries is in
violation in any material respect of any of the provisions of its Subsidiary
Charter Documents.

5.6 _Financial Statements_.

(a) The Company has delivered to Parent copies of (i) the audited consolidated
balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2012
and 2011 and the related audited consolidated statements of income, cash flows
and stockholders equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the years
ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2013 and the
related unaudited consolidated statements of income and stockholders equity of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal quarter and nine-month period
then ended (such audited and unaudited statements, including the related notes
and schedules thereto, are referred to herein as the " _Financial Statements_
"). Except as set forth in the notes thereto and, in the case of the
unaudited financial statements, normal recurring year-end adjustments, each of
the Financial Statements has been prepared in accordance with GAAP and
presents fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position
and results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the dates
and for the periods indicated therein. For the purposes hereof, the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
at September 30, 2013 is referred to as the " _Balance Sheet_ " and September
30, 2013 is referred to as the " _Balance Sheet Date_ ".

 



27 (b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.6(b)_ , neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any Indebtedness or liabilities that would be required to be
reflected in, reserved against or otherwise described on a balance sheet of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, or in the notes thereto, in
accordance with GAAP and that are not so reflected, reserved against or
described on the Balance Sheet, other than (i) liabilities incurred in the
Ordinary Course of Business after the Balance Sheet Date, (ii) liabilities

Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and (2) in a timely manner
accumulate and communicate to the Companys principal executive officer and
principal financial officer the type of information that would be required to
be disclosed in the Financial Statements (such systems and processes being
herein referred to as the " _Financial Controls_ "). Since January 1, 2012, to
the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, their
respective officers nor the Companys independent auditors, has identified or
been made aware of any material complaint, allegation, deficiency, assertion
or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the Financial Controls or the
Financial Statements that has not been resolved. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there have been no instances of fraud committed by any officer or
employee of the Company, whether or not material, that occurred during
any period covered by the Financial Statements.

or would not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Real Property Leases is

appurtenances pertaining or relating thereto) free and clear of any Liens
other than Permitted Exceptions.

(b)  _Schedule 5.9(b)_ sets forth the address and description of the

Surviving Corporation, or the operation of its business, thereat. The Owned
Real Property is in good condition and repair subject to ordinary wear and
tear in all material respects.

5.10  _Tangible Personal Property_. _Schedule 5.10_ sets forth all leases and
subleases of tangible personal property to or by the Company or a Subsidiary

Company Product (other than any employee invention assignment agreements or
agreements with independent contractor entities that provide for the

5.13 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Schedule 5.13(a)_ contains a list of each material Company Benefit Plan

means only those employment agreements constituting Significant Contracts
hereunder). " _Company Benefit Plans_ " means each "employee benefit plan"
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (" _ERISA_ "), whether or not subject to ERISA), and each
other compensation, incentive, equity-related, retirement, welfare,
employment, termination or other benefit plan, program, agreement, policy or
arrangement under which any current or former employee, director or consultant
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") has

Subsidiaries.

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has made available
to Parent copies of the following, to the extent applicable: (i) the plan
document and any related funding instrument, (ii) the most recent IRS
determination letter, (iii) the most recent summary plan description, (iv)

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained, funded, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other
applicable Laws. Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely on a
favorable opinion letter issued by the IRS and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there has been no occurrence or condition which could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on such determination. No nonexempt
"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan that could reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any material liability.

(d) None of the Company Benefit Plans is subject to Title IV or Section 302
of ERISA or is a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) or

210(a) of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code, and neither the Company nor

liability under Section 4980B of the Code or withdrawal liability that has
not been satisfied in full.

 



36 (e) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan, no actions, suits or claims
(other than routine claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course of Business)
are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, that could result
in a material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(f) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.13(f)_ , neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions, either alone or together
with any event, condition or circumstance, could (i) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or increase the amount payable under any Company Benefit
Plan, (ii) increase the compensation or benefits payable to any Company
Employee, or (iii) result in the forgiveness in whole or in part of any
outstanding loans made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Person.

 

(g) No amount or benefit that could be received or owed (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) as a result of or in connection with any
of the Transactions, whether alone or together with any other event, condition
or circumstance (excluding any actual or proposed agreements, payments or
arrangements entered into or proposed by or at the behest of the Parent
or its Affiliates to which the Company is not a party prior to the Closing
Date), by any Company Employee, or any other Person who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.280G-1), could be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such
term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

(h) No Company Benefit Plan or other agreement or arrangement of the Company
or its Subsidiaries provides any Person with a "gross up" or similar payment
in respect of any Taxes that may become payable under Section 409A or Section
4999 of the Code. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan and each other
agreement or arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code and is subject to Section 409A of the Code, (i) the
written terms of such arrangement have at all times since January 1, 2010 been

death or medical benefits, beyond termination of service or retirement, other
than coverage mandated by Law.

 

(j) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is maintained outside of
the United States or in which service providers located outside of the United
States participate, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any obligation in connection with the termination of, or withdrawal
from, such Company Benefit Plan and (ii) the present value of the benefit
liabilities (whether or not vested) under each such Company Benefit Plan,
determined as of the end of the Companys most recently ended fiscal year on a
the basis of actuarial assumptions, each of which is reasonable, did not
exceed the current value of the assets of such Company Benefit Plan allocable
to such benefit liabilities.

5.14 _Labor_.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound
by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other arrangement or

by, any Governmental Body relating to employees or employment practices.

or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any
Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if the entering into a definitive agreement relating to or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be
expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or

 



47  significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental Body necessary
to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (ii) significantly increase the risk of any
Governmental Body entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the

objections, if any, asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to this
Agreement so as to enable the Transactions to be completed by the Termination

to take such actions) as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any.

7.5 _Further Assurances_. Each of Parent and the Company shall use (and the
Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use) its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to
consummate the Transactions and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the

respective obligations to consummate the Transactions.

information provided to them in connection with this Agreement (including

hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the
individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were directors, officers or
managers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such or taken in some other capacity at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time on or prior to the Closing
Date. Parent agrees that all rights of the Indemnitees to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to
the Closing Date as provided in the Company Charter Documents or Subsidiary
Charter Documents, as applicable, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and any indemnification agreements of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights of the Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law or
approved by such Indemnitees. In addition, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay or reimburse any expenses of any Indemnitee
under this _Section 7.7_ as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
applicable Law.

(b) Parent, from and after the Closing Date, shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or comparable organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no
less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of certain
liabilities of directors, officers, managers, employees and agents and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
as applicable.

 



48 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
control the defense of, including the investigation and any settlement or
compromise of, any litigation, claim or proceeding (each, a " _Claim_ ")
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this _Section 7.7_ with
counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnitee shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim
at his or her own expense.

 

(d) Each of the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, and
cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any Claim
and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested
and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(e) At the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, obtain,
maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming the
Indemnitees as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six years
from the Closing Date from a insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
liability insurance with coverage comparable to the Companys existing
policies (the " _Existing Policy_ ") with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual
premiums for any such policy or policies in excess of 200% of the current
annual premium for such existing policies. If any future annual premiums
exceed 200% of the current annual premiums, then Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage to the amount
of coverage that can be obtained for an annual premium equal to 200% of the
current annual premium.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.7_: (i) are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

(g) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates or merges with or into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this
_Section 7.7_.

 

(h) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.7_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 7.7_ applies without the consent of the
affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom
this _Section 7.7_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 7.7_).

(i) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its directors or officers, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section
7.7_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

 



49 7.8 _Preservation of Records_. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the
respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a period of
seven (7) years from the Closing Date (or longer if required by applicable
Law) and shall make such records (or copies) and reasonably appropriate
personnel available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice,
to any Stockholder or the Representative, at the sole cost and expense of such
Stockholder or Representative, as may be reasonably required by such party in
connection with any insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings or Tax audits
against, governmental investigations of, or compliance with legal requirements
by, the Stockholders, the Representative or any of their
respective Affiliates, or otherwise pertain to any pre-Closing period.

7.9 _Publicity_. The initial press release announcing this Agreement, any
ancillary agreements and the Transactions shall be in substantially the form
attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit F_. No other press release, public
announcement or public filing related to this Agreement or the Transactions,
or prior to the Closing any other announcement or communication to the
employees, customers or suppliers of the Company, shall be issued or made by
any party hereto without the joint approval of Parent and the Company (which
approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless
required by Law (in the reasonable opinion of counsel) in which case Parent
and the Company shall have the right to review such press release,
announcement, public filing or communication prior to issuance, distribution
or publication. The parties understand and agree that Parent or its Affiliates
intend to publicly disclose the existence of this Agreement and the
Transactions subsequent to the execution of this Agreement; provided that any
such initial disclosure shall require the joint approval of Parent and the
Company (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld). For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that Accel-KKR Capital Partners
III, L.P. (" _Accel-KKR_ ") and its Affiliates (except for the Company and
its Subsidiaries) may provide general information (other than the identity of
any Parent Parties) about the subject matter of this Agreement in connection
with Accel-KKRs or its Affiliates normal fund raising, marketing,
informational or reporting activities.

7.10 _Exclusivity_. The Company agrees that after the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, it shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all of their respective
officers, directors, managers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, agents, advisors, representatives and controlled Affiliates of
the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit,
initiate, or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal; (b) initiate, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person
any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way or take any other
action knowingly to facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or could be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal; (c) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of the Companys or any Company
Subsidiaries securities; or (d) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to delivery of the
Written Consent, if the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith that it is required by its fiduciary duties to do so, the board of
directors may respond to any Person making an Acquisition Proposal after the
date of this Agreement that was not solicited after the execution of this
Agreement and will not be bound by the restrictions set forth above, in which
case, Parent will be entitled to receive any information provided to such
party simultaneously with delivery to any such party. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall promptly, but in any case within 48 hours after receiving
any Acquisition Proposal from a third party, advise Parent orally and in
writing thereof, including the identity of such party and the material terms
of any such offer, and the Company shall keep Parent fully informed with
respect thereto. For purposes of this _Section 7.10_, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, offer or proposal for, or
indication of interest in, a merger, consolidation, asset purchase, stock
purchase, stock exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction that is
similar in any respect to the Transactions or that otherwise involves any
purchase of the business, at least 51% of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the majority of the capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the Transactions.

 



50 7.11 _Notification_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
the Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable upon Mark Duffell,
Jeff Wylie or John Murray obtaining actual knowledge, with no duty of inquiry,
thereof, (a) of any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding that reasonably
could be anticipated to (i) render inaccurate in any material respect any
representation or warranty herein made by the Company or (ii) prohibit or
restrain or adversely affect the ability of such party to consummate the
Transactions or the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder
in all material respects, (b) in writing of any fact or condition that causes
or constitutes a material breach of the representations and warranties not
qualified by materiality or a breach of the representations and warranties
qualified by materiality made by the Company herein as of the date of this
Agreement, or any fact or condition that would cause or constitute a material
breach of any representation or warranty not qualified by materiality or a
breach of any representation or warranty qualified by materiality, in each
case as if such representation or warranty been made as of the time of the
occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition, (c) of the occurrence
of any material breach of any covenant of the Company and (d) of any claim,
or any verbal or written inquiry by any Taxing Authority, regarding a Tax
liability or potential Tax liability of the Company. Should any matter
described in this  _Section 7.11_ that first exists and occurs after the
date hereof require any change to the disclosure Schedules, the Company may
(but shall not be obligated to) also deliver to Parent a supplement to the
disclosure Schedules specifying such change; _provided_ , that such updated
disclosures will not be deemed to amend and supplement the appropriate
Schedules for purposes of (i) the conditions to closing set forth in _Section
8.1(a)_, (ii) Parents ability to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 4.1(e)_ or _Section 4.1(f)_, or (iii) Parents ability to bring
claims for indemnification under _Article IX_.

 

7.12 _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, intangible, recordation,
documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges, of any nature whatsoever,
applicable to, or resulting from, the Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation. For the avoidance of doubt,
Transfer Taxes do not include any Stockholders or Optionholders income
Taxes. The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
filing of any Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, including joining in
the execution of any such Tax Return or other documentation where necessary.
Parent and Representative shall, upon request of the other party, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Transfer Taxes.

(b) _Tax Returns_. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall timely prepare
and file (or cause such timely preparation and filing) with the appropriate
Taxing Authority all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
periods that (x) end prior to or on the Closing Date (each, a " _Pre-Closing
Tax Return_ ") the due date of which (including extensions) is after the
Closing Date, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay (or cause to
be paid) all Taxes shown thereon, or (y) include the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period Tax Return_ "), and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes shown thereon. All Pre-Closing Tax Returns
and Straddle Period Tax Returns described in the prior sentence shall be
prepared consistent with the methodologies and practices historically applied
by the Company and its Subsidiaries when filing its prior year Tax Return (for
purposes of this _Section 7.12_, the determination of Estimated Pre-Closing
Taxes and Final Pre-Closing Taxes pursuant to _Section 3.7_, and with respect
to Tax matters in _Article IX_ , the foregoing will be deemed to be "past
practice") except as otherwise required by applicable Law or as specifically
required under this Agreement. The Representative, at its sole expense, shall
have reasonable access during normal business hours to those persons preparing
any Pre-Closing Tax Return or Straddle Period Tax Return and the

 



51  information to be included in such Tax Return prior to such Tax Returns
submission to the Representative for review, as described below. With regard
to both Pre-Closing Tax Returns and Straddle Period Tax Returns, at least
twenty (20) days prior to the date on which each such Tax Return is due
(including extensions), Parent shall submit such Tax Return to the
Representative for its review, and within the ten (10) day period starting on
the day such Tax Return is submitted to the Representative for its review, the
Representative shall have the right to suggest modifications to such Tax
Returns. With regard solely to any Pre-Closing Tax Return, described in
the first sentence of this _Section 7.12(b)_, if the Representative does not
timely submit suggested modifications to Parent as described in the preceding
sentence, the Representative will waive its right to suggest modifications to
such Tax Return, or if the Representative does timely submit suggested
modifications to Parent as described in the prior sentence, Parent shall make
each such timely suggested modification to such Tax Return to the extent such
suggested modification is not inconsistent with the standard set forth in the
second sentence of this _Section 7.12(b)_; provided that if the Closing Date
is later than March 31, 2014, and such modification results in a material
reduction in Tax liability or material increase in a Tax refund or credit of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or a material increase in any amount
owed by Parent to Representative under _Section 7.12(f)_ hereof, in each case
allocable to a Tax period beginning before the Closing Date, the requirements
of this sentence shall also apply to Straddle Period Tax Returns. Parent shall
not file any Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without
Representatives consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided, however, that if such consent is not provided
Representatives failure to consent prior to the due date (including all
available extensions) for filing such Tax Return shall not prevent Parent
from timely filing any such Tax Return; and provided that if the Closing Date
is later than March 31, 2014, such consent right shall also apply to Pre-
Closing Straddle Returns that show a material amount of Taxes for which
Representative (in its capacity as such) could be liable to Parent hereunder.
For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary
(including without limitation in the case Representative does not provide
comments to any Tax Return or does not consent to its filing), the
Representative (in its capacity as such) shall be relieved of any obligation
to indemnify Parent or Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates with respect
to any Losses arising from Taxes directly attributable to a particular Tax
position taken by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries in
filing a Pre-Closing Tax Return or Straddle Period Tax Return (including
pursuant to any amendments of such Returns or pursuant to any elections or
changes in Tax accounting method with retroactive effect) that is
inconsistent with the past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
except to the extent that such Tax position is required by applicable Law or a
Taxing Authority or mutually agreed in writing by the Representative and
Parent.

(c) _Cooperation_.

 

(i) The Representative (acting on behalf of the Stockholders) and Parent shall
cooperate reasonably with respect to (a) the preparation and filing of all
Pre-Closing Tax Returns and Straddle Period Tax Returns with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (b) the resolution of all disputes with and
audits by a Taxing Authority relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, including, but
not limited to, giving each other reasonable access to records, personnel or
powers of attorney reasonably necessary in connection with such Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and cooperating, as necessary, in
responding to any inquiries, audits or similar proceedings by any Taxing
Authority relating to such Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, a " _Tax Matter_ "). Subject to the foregoing, (x) with regard to any
Tax Matter that concerns any Pre-Closing Tax Return, Parent shall manage and
control such Tax Matter and the Representative shall be entitled to
participate in any such Tax Matter to the extent such Tax Matter could
reasonably be expected to materially impact Taxes (including a potential
refund of Taxes) in a Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (y) with regard to any Tax
Matter that concerns any Straddle Period Tax Return, Parent shall manage and
control such Tax Matter and the Representative shall be entitled to
participate in any such Tax Matter to the extent such Tax Matter could
reasonably be expected

 



52  to materially impact Taxes (including a potential refund of Taxes) with
respect to the Pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period. In the event of any
conflict between this  _Section 7.12(c)(i)_ and _Section 9.3_, this
_Section 7.12(c)(i)_ shall be controlling.

(ii) Parent shall (A) cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to retain all
books and records (in their possession on the Closing Date or produced
thereafter by the Parent, Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries) with
respect to Tax Matters pertinent to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
shorter of (1) the retention period described in _Section 7.8_, or (2) 180
days after the expiration of the statute of limitations (including any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority and (B)
give the Representative reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records, and, if the
Representative so requests, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall allow the Representative to take
possession of such books and records at the sole expense of the
Representative provided the Representative agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of any such books and records. Parent, the Company and its
Subsidiaries each agree that it will cooperate with and make available to the
Representative, during normal business hours, all books and records and other
information (in the possession of the Company or its Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date or produced thereafter by the Parent, Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries) and employees (without substantial disruption of
employment) retained and remaining in existence after the Closing that are
necessary or useful in connection with any Tax Matter involving a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period. For the avoidance of doubt,
reference in the prior sentence to books and records includes any workpaper,
schedule, document, computation or verification of any amount paid or payable,
in each case related to such Tax Matter. Parent and the Representative shall,
upon request of the other party, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain or provide any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority
or any other Person, at the sole expense of the requesting party, as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). The
Representative shall make all information with respect to Taxes pertinent to
the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Pre-Closing Straddle Period in Representatives possession on the Closing Date
available to Parent to enable Parent and its Affiliates to properly compute
their taxable income. Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on one hand, and
the Representative, on the other hand, shall provide any necessary consents
and powers of attorney required by the other party for such other party to
conduct and control Tax Matters with respect to the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries for which such party has control hereunder. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this _Section 7.12(c)(ii)_ shall require the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to prepare or produce
outside the ordinary course of their respective businesses any books or
records with respect to taxable periods beginning before the Closing Date.

 

(d) _Interpretation_. For purposes of this Agreement, "Pre-Closing Taxes"
consist of (1) any accrued and unpaid Tax liability of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, as of the Closing Date, allocable to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and (2) any allocation of Taxes to a Pre-Closing Straddle Period under
this _Section 7.12(d)_. Any Tax of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to any Straddle Period (except for Transfer Taxes described in
_Section 7.12(a)_, the allocation of which is governed by that section) shall
be apportioned to the portion of such Straddle Period up to and including the
Closing Date (such portion, a " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ "), based, (i)
in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income,
payroll, payments or receipts, upon a _per diem_  basis and, (ii) in the case
of any Tax based upon or related to income, payroll, payments or receipts,
upon the amount of such Taxes which would be payable if the relevant taxable
period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date. For purposes of
this _Section 7.12(d)_, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item that
is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period in the same manner as that set forth in clause (i) of this
_Section 7.12(d)_. Proration of Taxes that are undetermined as of the

 



53  Closing Date (1) shall be based on the most recently available Tax rate and
valuation, giving effect to applicable exemptions, recently-voted millage,
change in valuation, and similar items, whether or not officially certified
to the appropriate Taxing Authority as of the Closing Date, and (2) shall use
a 365-day year.

 

(e) _Filing and Amendment of Tax Returns; Elections_. Except as required by
applicable Law or by a Taxing Authority, without the prior written consent of
the Representative (in the case of matters pertaining solely to Straddle
Periods, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Parent,
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not (i) except for
Tax Returns that are filed pursuant to _Section 7.12(b)_ or _Section
7.12(f)_, file or amend or permit any of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to file or amend any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (ii) with respect to Tax Returns filed pursuant to _Section
7.12(b)_, after the date such Tax Returns are filed pursuant to _Section
7.12(b)_, amend or permit any of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
to amend any such Tax Return (provided that in the case of Straddle Period
Tax Returns, Parent may amend such Tax Returns without the consent of the
Representative if such amendment does not result in a material increase in Tax
liability or material decrease in Tax refund or credit of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or a material increase in any amount owed by Parent to
Representative under _Section 7.12(f)_ hereof allocable to a Tax period
beginning before the Closing Date), (iii) extend or waive, or cause to be
extended or waived, or permit the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
or extend or waive, any statute of limitations or other period for the
assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period (provided that Parent may so extend, waive or permit such
extension or waiver of any such statute or period related to a Straddle Period
without the consent of Representative if such extension or waiver is not with
respect to an amount in controversy that reasonably could result in a material
increase in Tax liability or material decrease in Tax refund or credit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or a material increase in any amount owed
by Parent to Representative under _Section 7.12(f)_ hereof allocable to a
Tax period beginning before the Closing Date), (iv) make or change any Tax
election or accounting method that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Periods or Straddle Periods of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries (provided that Parent may make or change such an election or
accounting method with retroactive effect to Straddle Periods without the
consent of Representative if such election or change does not result in a
material increase in Tax liability or material decrease in Tax refund or
credit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or a material increase in any
amount owed by Parent to Representative under  _Section 7.12(f)_ hereof
allocable to a Tax period beginning before the Closing Date) or (v) make any
election under Section 338 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or non-U.S. law) with respect to the Transactions.

(f) _Tax Refunds_. Except to the extent reflected as an asset in the final
calculation of Net Working Capital or included as a reduction in Final Pre-
Closing Taxes, the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholder Parties) shall
be entitled to (A) any Tax refunds that are received by the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries (other than refunds attributable to
VAT, GST or any similar sales or use tax to the extent such amounts are
required to be returned by the Parent, Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries to a customer after the Closing Date), and (B) any
amounts credited against Tax (other than amounts credited against Tax with
respect to VAT, GST or similar sales or use tax to the extent that amounts
with respect thereto are required to be returned by the Parent, Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to a customer after the Closing Date), and
(C) any reduction in any Pre-Closing Taxes, excluding any amounts relating to
the items set forth on _Schedule 9.1(a)(iv)_ , paid by the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries as compared to the amount taken into account
with respect to such Pre-Closing Taxes, excluding any amounts relating to the
items set forth on _Schedule 9.1(a)(iv)_ , in the determination of Final Pre-
Closing Taxes, to which the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries become entitled in a Tax period ending after the Closing Date, in
each case, that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or that are allocable to a
Pre-Closing Straddle Period, as determined under _Section 7.12(d)_) of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. The Parent shall pay over to
the

 



54  Paying Agent (on behalf of each Series B Stockholder, Common Stockholder and
Optionholder in accordance with their respective Allocation Percentages) any
such refund, credit or reduction within five (5) days after receipt of such
refund or within five (5) days of filing of the Tax Return reflecting such
credit or reduction. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns under
_Section 7.12(b)_, the Parent and the Representative agree that the
Surviving Corporation shall elect to carry back any item of loss, deduction or
credit from any Tax period ending on the Closing Date, to prior taxable years
to the fullest extent permitted by law (using any available short-form or
accelerated procedures (including filing IRS Form 1139 and any corresponding
form for applicable state, local and foreign tax purposes) and filing amended
Tax Returns to the extent necessary) and obtain any potential Tax refunds
or claims related thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment
required to be made by Parent to the Representative pursuant this _Section
7.12(f)_, shall be reduced by the amount of any Tax liability of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Pre-Closing Straddle
Periods, not included in the calculation of Final Pre-Closing Taxes, Net
Working Capital, Transaction Costs or Indebtedness to the extent that
Representative could have liability for such Tax liability under _Article IX_
(including applicable limitations); provided, however, that for the avoidance
of doubt the amount of any Tax liability offset against a payment otherwise
due to Representative pursuant to this  _Section 7.12(f)_ shall count toward
the Representative Cap as if paid in cash as an indemnity under _Section
9.1(b)_.

 

7.13 _Financing Assistance_. Although the parties acknowledge and agree that
obtaining financing is not a condition to Closing, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
officers, employees representatives and advisors, including legal, financial
and accounting advisors, to, provide such cooperation as is reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with its financing (the " _Financing_ ") in
connection with the Transactions, including (i) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions,
and reasonably assisting Parent and the Financing Sources in the preparation
of definitive financing documents, offering documents, rating agency
presentations and other materials reasonably and customarily requested to be
used in connection with obtaining the Financing, (ii) if reasonably requested
by Parent or a Financing Source, providing direct contact between senior
management and representatives (including accountants) of the Company, on the
one hand, and Financing Sources or potential Financing Sources, potential
lenders and investors for the Financing, on the other hand, (iii) providing
reasonably promptly to Parent and the Financing Sources such financial and
other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries which is set
forth on _Schedule 7.13_ or such other financial information that is readily
available or within the Companys possession, in each case, as is reasonably
requested in connection with obtaining the Financing, (iv) the Company and its
Subsidiaries executing and delivering reasonable and customary certificates,
management representation letters and other documentation required by
the Financing Sources and the definitive documentation relating to the
Financing, (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in
satisfying the conditions precedent set forth in any definitive documentation
relating to the Financing, (vi) delivering notices of prepayment within the
time periods required by the agreements governing the Closing Indebtedness for
the repayment in full thereof at the Effective Time; (vii) delivering
possessory collateral (such as certificated equity and promissory notes)
within its possession or the possession of Closing Indebtedness lenders, and
(viii) taking all reasonable formal corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
the consummation of the Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide such
cooperation to the extent such cooperation materially interferes with the
Companys or its Subsidiaries day to day operations or to produce the
information above if such information is unavailable to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or its production is impracticable or would cause undue burden
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (2) unless otherwise expressly agreed by
the Company in its sole discretion, the effectiveness of the documentation
executed or delivered by the Company under this _Section 7.13_ shall
be subject to the effectiveness of the Merger, (3) the pre-Closing board of
the directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or equivalent

 



55  governing body) shall not be required to approve any document or other
matter related to the Financing or incur any liability with respect thereto,
(4) Parent shall coordinate its request for the Companys assistance so as to
minimize disruption to the Companys executive officers day to day
responsibilities, and (5) the Companys obligations set forth in this _Section
7.13_ shall not include any obligation on the part of the Company to (I)
obtain accountants comfort letters or legal opinions, (II) provide solvency
opinions, (III) provide Regulation S-X compliant financial statements, or (IV)
incur any liability in connection with, related to or arising from the
Financing or to any Financing Source prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the cooperation contemplated by this _Section 7.13_. The Company shall notify
Parent promptly if it materially restates any audited historical financial
statements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provided for under this
_Section 7.13_, in whole or in part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection
with the Financing prior to the Effective Time. The Company will be deemed in
compliance with this _Section 7.13_, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub may
allege that the Company is or has not been in compliance with this _Section
7.13_, unless Parent provides prompt written notice of the alleged failure to
comply specifying in reasonable detail specific steps to cure such alleged
failure in a commercially reasonable and practicable manner consistent with
this _Section 7.13_, which failure to comply has not been cured within ten
(10) Business Days from receipt of such written notice (in which case the
Outside Date shall also be extended by the number of days that the Company
actually failed to be in compliance with this _Section 7.13_, including any
portion of the cure period used by the Company).

 

7.14 _280G Matters._

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company will provide each "disqualified
individual" with respect to the Company (within the meaning of Section 280G(c)
of the Code) with the opportunity to either (i) unconditionally waive and
forfeit such "disqualified individuals" rights to any payment or benefits
that would constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) (the " _Unconditionally Waived 280G Benefits_ ")
so that all remaining payments and/or benefits, if any, shall not be deemed to
be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code) or (ii) waive such "disqualified individuals" rights to some or all of
such payments or benefits (the " _Conditionally Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so
that all remaining payments and/or benefits, if any, shall not be deemed to be
"excess parachute payments;" _provided_ that, following the execution of the
waivers with respect to the Conditionally Waived 280G Benefits, the Company
will submit to a stockholder vote (along with adequate disclosure satisfying
the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder) the right of any such "disqualified individual" to
receive the Conditionally Waived 280G Benefits. Not less than five Business
Days prior to soliciting such waivers and, if applicable, stockholder vote,
the Company shall provide drafts of such materials (incorporating the
information regarding Parent 280G Payments in the notice from Parent provided
pursuant to _Section 7.14(c)_) to Parent for its review and approval prior
to soliciting such waivers and, if applicable, soliciting such stockholder
vote. Any Unconditionally Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided.
If any of the Conditionally Waived 280G Benefits fail to be approved by the
stockholders as contemplated above, such Conditionally Waived 280G Benefits
shall not be made or provided. Parent will provide the Company with
information regarding any payment then anticipated to be made by Parent
following the Closing that would reasonably be expected to constitute a
"parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code)
to any "disqualified individual" with respect to the Company (within the
meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) and will cooperate as reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with the Companys compliance with this
_Section 7.14_.

 



56 (b) In the event that the Company solicits waivers with respect to any
Conditionally Waived 280G Benefits, prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably acceptable to Parent that a vote
of the stockholders of the Company was solicited in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this  _Section 7.14_ and that either (i) the
requisite number of votes of the stockholders of the Company was obtained with
respect to the Conditionally Waived 280G Benefits (the " _280G Approval_ ") or
(ii) the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, the
Conditionally Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided. In no event
shall this _Section 7.14_ be construed to require the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof to compel any Person to waive any existing rights under
any Contract that such Person has with the Company or any Subsidiary thereof,
and in no event shall the Company or any Subsidiary thereof be deemed in
breach of this _Section 7.14_ if any such Person refuses to waive any such
rights or any or all of the stockholders fail to approve any Conditionally
Waived 280G Benefits.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect
to each individual whom the Company has identified in written notice to Parent
no later than January 15, 2014 as a disqualified individual, (i) the Company
shall have no obligation to seek waivers from any such person with respect to
any payment or benefit attributable to any actual or proposed agreements or
arrangements entered into or proposed by or at the behest of Parent or its
Affiliates to which the Company is not a party as of January 15, 2014 ("
_Parent 280G Payments_ ") and (ii) no amounts with respect to Parent 280G
Payments shall be treated as payments or benefits that could constitute or
contribute to the calculation of any potential parachute payments for
purposes of the requirements of this _Section 7.14_ or _Section 9.1(a)(iv)_,
except, in each case, to the extent that Parent has provided written notice to
the Company of the nature and amount of any actual or potential Parent 280G
Payments with respect to the identified disqualified individuals no later than
three (3) Business Days after Parent has received the notice specified in this
_Section 7.14(c)_.

 

7.15 _Post-Closing Obligation_. From and after the Closing through April 30,
2015, unless required by Law, Parent will not perform invasive or subsurface
investigations of, expand or otherwise alter the external physical structure
(other than cosmetic changes) or external physical footprint on the Owned Real
Property located in Renfrewshire, Scotland and referenced on  _Schedule
5.9(b)_ without the prior written consent of the Representative (which consent
may be withheld for any reason). In the event a good faith claim for
indemnification has been made by Parent or a Parent Indemnified Party alleging
a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.17_,
Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid taking any action
intended to increase the amount of any Losses arising in connection with such
breach.

to comply with any provision of this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

9.1  _Indemnification of Parent Indemnified Parties_.

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this
_Article IX_ ), the Representative (in its capacity as such) will indemnify
Parent and its Affiliates and each of their officers, directors, employees or
agents (each, a " _Parent Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the "
_Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, Taxes, damages, expenses, penalties, fines, and costs (including
reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses and the cost of
investigation and defense) whether or not involving a third party claim, but
excluding any reduction in Tax net operating loss or other Tax attribute of
the Company or its Subsidiaries that does not result in an increase in Pre-
Closing Taxes (" _Losses_ "), suffered by any Parent Indemnified Party to the
extent arising out of, in connection with, or related to (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in

 



59  this Agreement or by any Stockholder in the Letter of Transmittal delivered
by such Stockholder, (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by (x)
the Company in  _Section 7.2(b)_, _Section 7.3_, _Section 7.9_, _Section
7.10_, _Section 7.11_, and _Section 7.14_ to be performed prior to the
Closing (the " _Specified Covenants_ ") or (y) the Representative to be
performed following the Closing, (iii) any Adjustment Escrow Deficiency Amount
in accordance with _Section 3.7_, and (iv) any item set forth on _Schedule
9.1(a)(iv)_.

 

(b) In addition to (but without duplication of) the foregoing, from and after
the Closing, the Representative (in its capacity as such) will indemnify the
Parent Indemnified Parties from and against any Taxes imposed on the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (whether imposed by Law, Tax sharing agreement, Tax
indemnity obligation or similar agreement in respect of Taxes that was
entered into prior to the Closing Date, or otherwise) with respect to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods or Pre-Closing Straddle Periods, in each case, to the
extent not otherwise already accrued in the calculation of Final Pre-Closing
Taxes, Net Working Capital, Transaction Costs or Indebtedness, and excluding
any Taxes attributable to (A) any election made under Section 338 of the Code
(or any corresponding foreign, state or local election), (B) any tax elections
or amended Tax Returns (other than tax elections or amended Tax Returns filed
pursuant to _Section 7.12_ and, to the extent required, consented to by
Representative) or changes in method of Tax accounting, in each case, made or
filed after the Closing Date and that is not consistent with "past practices"
as defined in _Section 7.12(b)_ (except where such election, return or change
is required by applicable Law or a Taxing Authority), (C) the financing of the
Transactions, or (D) transactions occurring on the Closing Date but after the
Closing.

(c) No claim shall be brought or maintained by any Parent Indemnified Party
against any Stockholder Party or any other Person other than (i) the
Representative in accordance with this _Article IX_, (ii) the RandW Insurer
pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy and (iii) any Stockholder for any breach
of the representations and warranties set forth in the Letter of Transmittal
or any breach of the Specified Representations, and no recourse shall be
brought or granted against any such Person other than (i) the Representative
in accordance with this _Article IX_, (ii) the RandW Insurer pursuant to the
RandW Insurance Policy and (iii) any Stockholder for any breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in the Letter of Transmittal or any
breach of the Specified Representations, in each case by virtue of or based
upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants of any party hereto set forth
or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any
document or certificate delivered hereunder or otherwise relating to or
arising from the Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this  _Section 9.1(c)_ shall not preclude or limit Fraud Claims.

9.2 _Limitations; Survival_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to _Section
9.2(f)_, Parent shall not be entitled to recover Losses under _Section 9.1_
(X) unless, until and only to the extent that the aggregate amount of all
Losses suffered or incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties exceeds in the
aggregate $5,140,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case Parent shall be
entitled to indemnification only for such excess (subject to the Cap or the
Representative Cap, as the case may be), (Y) in excess of $51,500,000 or such
greater amount as may be provided in the RandW Insurance Policy (the " _Cap_
"), and (Z) for any single claim less than $50,000 (the " _Mini-Basket_ "),
except that a series of related claims (or Losses), including individual
Tax claims, shall be aggregated for purposes of this _Section 9.2(a)(Z)_
Mini-Basket. The Parent Indemnified Parties will be entitled to recover for,
and the Deductible and the Mini-Basket set forth in this _Section 9.2(a)(X)_
and  _(Z)_ , respectively shall not apply to (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Cap or the Representative Cap, as applicable, shall apply to), any
claims for Losses arising out of, in connection with, or related to any
Adjustment Escrow Deficiency Amount in accordance with _Section 3.7_, and
each claim for indemnification set forth in _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_, _Section
9.1(a)(iv)_ __or _Section 9.1(b)_.

 



60 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, but
subject to _Section 9.2(f)_ , it is agreed that the RandW Insurance Policy
procured by Parent shall be the Parent Indemnified Parties sole recourse and
source for recovery for Losses under this _Article IX_ in excess of the
Representatives maximum liability for $25,000,000 in the aggregate (as such
$25,000,000 amount shall be reduced in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Representative Cap_ "). For indemnification claims made by
the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement (subject to the
other limitations set forth herein, including, without limitation, if
applicable, the Deductible and the Mini Basket): (1)(x) at any time from and
after the Closing to and including April 30, 2015 (the "General Survival
Period"), the Representative Cap shall be $25,000,000 and (y) the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification from the
Representative (and the Representative shall only have liability) for claims
made during such General Survival Period (regardless of when an
indemnification payment is made with respect to such claims, including if
otherwise to be paid after such period) for Losses in an amount up to the
remainder of (A) $25,000,000 _minus_ (B) the aggregate of all amounts paid
(at any time) to the Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of indemnification
claims pursuant to this _Article IX_; (2)(x) at any time after April 30, 2015
and prior to April 30, 2016 (the " _Initial Line Item Indemnity Period_ "),
the Representative Cap shall be decreased to $12,500,000 and (y) the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification from the
Representative (and the Representative shall only have liability) for claims
made during such Initial Line Item Indemnity Period (regardless of when an
indemnification payment is made with respect to such claims, including if
otherwise to be paid after such period) solely pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)(iv)_ and _Section 9.1(b)_ and then only for Losses in an amount up to
the lesser of (i) the reduced Representative Cap of $12,500,000 and (ii) the
remainder of (A) $25,000,000 _minus_ (B) the aggregate of all amounts paid
(at any time) to the Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of indemnification
claims pursuant to this _Article IX_; (3)(x) at any time on or after April
30, 2016 and on or prior to February 3, 2017 (the " _Second Line Item
Indemnity Period_ "), the Representative Cap shall be further reduced to
$6,250,000 and (y) the Parent Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification from Representative (and Representative shall only have
liability) for claims made during such Second Line Item Indemnity Period
(regardless of when an indemnification payment is made with respect to such
claims, including if otherwise to be paid after such period) solely pursuant
to  _Section 9.1(a)(iv)_ and _Section 9.1(b)_ and then only for Losses in
an amount up to the lesser of (i) the reduced Representative Cap of $6,250,000
and (ii) the remainder of (A) $25,000,000 _minus_ (B) the aggregate of
all amounts paid (at any time) to the Parent Indemnified Parties in respect
of indemnification claims pursuant to this _Article IX_; and (4) after
February 3, 2017, (x) the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification from Representative pursuant to this _Article IX_ and (y)
the Representative Cap shall be reduced to $0 (it being understood that the
reduction of the Representative Cap to zero ($0) and the foregoing subclause
(4)(x) of this  _Section 9.2(b)_ shall not affect the ability of the Parent
Indemnified Parties to recover, subject to the limitations herein, in respect
of any unresolved claims validly made and outstanding as of February 3, 2017).
For purposes of clarity, in no event will the Parent Indemnified Parties be
entitled to indemnification (or the Representative be liable pursuant to this
_Article IX_) unless at any time an indemnification payment is to be made,
the payment of such amount would be eligible to be payable pursuant to the
preceding _Section 9.2(b)(1)_ through _(4)_ above. In addition, the parties
agree that any payment of any Adjustment Escrow Deficiency Amount in
accordance with _Section 3.7_ (or  _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_ ) shall reduce the
Representative Cap on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event, other than as set forth in _Section 9.2(f)_ , shall the
Representative be liable in excess of $25,000,000 in the aggregate.

(c) Following the Closing, except solely for claims against the RandW Insurer
pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy, and subject to _Section 9.2(f)_, the
indemnification from the Representative pursuant to _Section 9.1_ (in no
event to exceed the Representative Cap) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
for any Loss, liability or damage, whether or not arising out of third party
claims, (including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses, court costs and all reasonable amounts paid in
investigation, defense or settlement of any of the foregoing) of the Parent
Indemnified Parties with respect to any misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or
breach of, any representations or warranties of the Company (or the
Representative or any Stockholder Party, if applicable) or any breach or
failure in performance of any covenants or agreements made by the
Stockholders, the Optionholders, the Representative and/or, prior to Closing,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in this Agreement or in any
exhibit or schedules hereto or any document or certificate delivered
hereunder or otherwise relating to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, their
businesses,

 



61  operations, assets, properties, liabilities or this Agreement or the
Transactions. Parent (and the Parent Indemnified Parties) may not avoid such
limitation on liability by seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or
pursuant to any other theory of liability other than as set forth in _Section
9.2(f)._ For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall in no event limit,
waive or restrict any claim for damages for breach of contract, tort or
pursuant to any other theory of liability (and Parent hereby acknowledges and
agrees that such remedies are not barred or prohibited), that the Company (if
prior to the Closing) or the Representative (whether for itself or on behalf
of one or more Stockholder Parties) may bring against Parent, including for
any breach by Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any covenant to be
performed following the Closing, subject to the limitation set forth in 
_Section 4.3_ on the terms set forth therein.

(d) Solely for purposes of the RandW Insurance Policy, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company, the
Stockholders, the Optionholders and the Representative set forth in this
Agreement or in any Letter of Transmittal shall survive the Closing and shall
terminate and expire on the close of business on the date that is set forth
in the RandW Insurance Policy which shall not be sooner than three (3) years
after the Closing Date (the " _R andW Expiration Date_") except that (a) the RandW
Expiration Date for the Fundamental Insurance Representations shall be no
sooner than the date that is six (6) years after the Closing Date, and (b) the
RandW Expiration Date for the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 5.11_ shall be no sooner than the date that is four (4) years after
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the parties agree that if any Parent Indemnified Party delivers, prior to the
RandW Expiration Date, a notice in respect of a claim regarding a breach of a
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement, then
such representation or warranty will survive the RandW Expiration Date and
remain in full force and effect with respect to such claim until the final
resolution thereof. For all other purposes (including for purposes of the
indemnification obligations of the Representative pursuant to this _Article
IX_ ), the representations and warranties of the Company or the Stockholders
set forth in this Agreement or in any Letter of Transmittal shall survive the
Closing and shall terminate and expire on the close of business on April 30,
2015 (the " _Representative Expiration Date_ "), except that notwithstanding
the foregoing, claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(iv)_
and _Section 9.1(b)_ may be brought against the Representative on or before
February 3, 2017 (subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.2(b)_).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties agree
that if any Parent Indemnified Party delivers, prior to the Representative
Expiration Date, a written notice to the Representative in respect of a claim
regarding a breach of a representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement, then such representation or warranty will survive the
Representative Expiration Date and remain in full force and effect with
respect to such claim until the final resolution thereof.

(e) Each covenant of the Company, the Representative or Parent in this
Agreement, which contemplates performance following the Closing (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the covenants in _Sections 3.3_ , _3.4_ , and _3.8_ )
shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms; _provided_ ,
_however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the covenants contained in _Article
VII_ shall terminate on the Closing Date upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than the covenants contained in
_Sections 7.7_ , _7.8_ ,  _7.9_ and _7.12_ , which shall survive in
accordance with their terms and the Specified Covenants which shall survive
until April 30, 2015); _provided_ _further_ that Parent may seek indemnity for
a breach of the Specified Covenants pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ so long
as a valid claim is made in accordance with this Agreement on or before April
30, 2015.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 9.2_
shall preclude or limit (i) Fraud Claims, including, but not limited to, the
waiver contained in _Section 9.2(c)_ or (ii) Parents ability to seek
indemnification directly from any Stockholder for any breach of the
representations and warranties of such Stockholder set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal delivered by such Stockholder or any breach of the Specified
Representations at any time on or prior to April 30, 2015;

 



62   _provided_ that Parent shall not be entitled to recover Losses arising out
of, in connection with, or related to any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in the Letter of Transmittal or any breach of the
Specified Representations from any Stockholder (including the Representative
in its capacity as a Stockholder) in excess of the aggregate cash proceeds
received by such Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (it being understood
that the Representative Holdback Amount shall not be included in determining
the proceeds received by the Representative in its capacity as a Stockholder);
_provided_ _further_ that the representations and warranties set forth in the
Letter of Transmittal and the Specified Representations shall terminate and
expire on the close of business on April 30, 2015.

 

(g) (i) _Control._ The obligation of the Representative to indemnify the
Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to the matters marked with an
asterisk on _Schedule 9.1(a)(iv)_ will be limited to 90% of the Losses
incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties attributable thereto to the extent
such Losses arise as a result of a Legal Proceeding initiated by a
Governmental Body where Parent controls the conduct of such Legal Proceeding
(and in the case of all other such Losses, Representatives obligation to
indemnify will remain at 100% (subject to the other terms and conditions of
this _Article IX_ )).

 

(ii) _Initiation, Action and Past Practices._ Except as otherwise set forth in
this _Section 9.2(g)(ii)_, Representative shall not have any obligation to
indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties (pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(iv)_ or
otherwise) with respect to any matter marked with an exclamation on _Schedule
9.1(a)(iv)_ to the extent the resulting Losses relating to such matter: (x)
arise from a Legal Proceeding with a Governmental Body that is (A) initiated
by Parent or arising following action taken by Parent, in each case that is
designed to result in the initiation of a Legal Proceeding with a
Governmental Body, or (B) a result of a disclosure made to a Governmental Body
by Parent, Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates, except to the extent
such initiation or action in the case of (A), or disclosure in the case
of (B), is required by applicable Law (the "Required by Law Exception"), or
such initiation or action in the case of (A), or disclosure in the case of
(B), is explicitly contemplated and permitted by this Agreement or (y)
are attributable, other than to a disclosure referred to in this _Section
9.2(g)(ii)(x)(B)_ , to the failure of Parent to comply with the "past
practice" standard with respect to the portion of any Tax Returns which
relates to the matters marked with an exclamation on _Schedule 9.1(a)(iv)_
occurring in Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Pre-Closing Straddle Periods, except
to the extent such deviation from past practice is subject to the Required by
Law Exception and relates to the matters marked with an exclamation on
_Schedule 9.1(a)(iv)_ , or is explicitly contemplated and permitted by this
Agreement). Parent shall be entitled to determine in the first instance
whether any initiation, action or deviation from past practice satisfies the
Required by Law Exception and may take any such action that Parent determines
in good faith is required by applicable Law, without the consent of the
Representative, but will provide Representative prompt written
notification of such initiation or action, if any, and disclose in writing to
Representative in reasonable detail the nature of any such initiation, action,
or deviation from past practice, if any. Parent shall not be liable for any
failure to promptly notify the Representative of any such initiation, action
or deviation from past practice unless the Representative is actually and
materially prejudiced by such delay in notification. Representative may, at
any time, including in connection with an indemnification claim made under
_Section 9.1_ hereof with respect to the matters marked with an exclamation
on _Schedule 9.1(a)(iv)_ , dispute whether the Required by Law Exception was
satisfied. If Representative wishes to dispute Parents position regarding
the Required by Law Exception, the parties shall refer such dispute to a
mutually agreed big four accounting firm unless otherwise agreed by the
parties (the " _Dispute Firm_ "). The parties will provide to the Dispute
Firm the information necessary to resolve such dispute. If the Dispute Firm
determines, at least at a should level, that Parents initiation, action or
deviation satisfied the Required by Law Exception, Representative shall
bear the costs of the Dispute Firms fees related to the dispute, and there
shall be no alteration of the Representatives indemnification caused by this
_Section 9.2(g)(ii)_. For the avoidance of doubt, no costs related to
resolving the dispute, including the Dispute Firms fees incurred in this
dispute, shall in any way affect the Representatives indemnification
obligations set forth in _Section 9.2(b)_ hereof, and 

 



63  Representative shall bear sole cost of such fees which will not apply
against the Representative Cap. Alternatively, if the Dispute Firm does not
determine, at least at a should level, that Parents initiation or action
satisfied the Required by Law Exception, Parent shall bear the costs of the
Dispute Firms fees related to the dispute and the obligation of
Representative to indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties (pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)(iv)_ or otherwise) for the matter in question shall, with respect to
any matter marked with an exclamation point on _Schedule 9.1(a)(iv),_ be
limited to two-thirds of the Losses incurred by the Parent Indemnified
Parties with respect to which Parent initiated or took the action in question;
provided that, except as otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement (
_e.g._ , pursuant to operation of the Representative Cap), with respect to
Losses arising in connection with the items listed in item 4 of _Schedule
9.1(a)(iv),_ Parent Indemnified Parties shall not bear ( _i.e.,_ through lack
of indemnification hereunder) Losses of more than $3,000,000 hereunder.

 

9.3 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

 

(a) In order for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim, suit
or demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third
Party Claim and the facts known by the Indemnified Party relating thereto
promptly within 30 days after receiving written notice from a third party
which may give rise to a Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
within seven (7) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) delivered by such
Person to the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) If (x) the Indemnifying Party, subject to the limitations set forth
in this _Article IX_, has conceded liability to indemnify the Indemnified
Party with respect to all Losses relating to such Third Party Claim, (y)
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Parent Indemnified Party or their
respective representatives are the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified
Party reasonably determines that the likely maximum amount of such Losses is
less than or equal to the Cap, and (z) the Third Party Claim is not reasonably
likely to have an adverse effect on the Indemnified Party or its Affiliate
other than as a result of monetary damages, then the Indemnifying Party shall
have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a
given Third Party Claim to elect, at its option, to assume the defense of any
such Third party Claim, in which case:

(i) the attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court or
arbitration costs incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with
defending such Third Party Claim shall be payable by such Indemnifying Party
(unless such Indemnifying Party is the Representative, in which case, such
costs shall be payable from the Representative Holdback Amount);

(ii) the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to be indemnified for any
costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defenses of such Third Party Claim following the Indemnifying Partys
assumption of such defense, except for actual out-of-pocket costs incurred
in connection with the Indemnifying Partys requests pursuant to _Sections
9.3(b)(iv)_ , _(v)_ and _(vi)_ which costs shall be reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party;

 

(iii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to monitor such defense at its
sole expense;

 



64 (iv) the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all
books and records that are under the control of the Indemnified Party and
that the Indemnifying Party reasonably considers necessary or desirable for
the defense of such Third Party Claim subject to appropriate confidentiality
protection to the extent applicable; 

(v) the Indemnified Party shall execute such documents and take such other
actions as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request for the purpose of
facilitating the defense of, or any settlement or compromise of such Third
Party Claim;

(vi) the Indemnified Party shall otherwise cooperate as reasonably requested
by the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such Third Party Claim;

(vii) the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to
such Third Party Claim; and

(viii) the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any agreement providing
for the settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim or the consent to
the entry of a judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement
agreement imposes on the Indemnified Party or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates any obligation other than, in the case where the Representative is
the Indemnifying Party, an obligation to pay Losses in an amount less than
the Representative Cap.

(c) If (i) the Indemnifying Party has not conceded liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to all Losses relating to such Third Party
Claim, (ii) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
representatives are the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines in good faith that the likely maximum amount of such
Losses is greater than the Representative Cap, (iii) the Indemnifying Party
elects not to defend a Third Party Claim or (iv) the Indemnifying Party is
not permitted to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim pursuant to
_Section 9.3(b)_ above, then the Indemnified Party shall diligently and
competently defend such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall have no right to seek indemnification under this
_Article IX_ in respect of such Third Party Claim for any agreement providing
for the settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim or the consent to
the entry of a judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim entered into
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) If any Indemnified Party asserts the existence of a claim giving rise to
Losses (but excluding Third Party Claims), such party shall give written
notice to the Indemnifying Party promptly upon having knowledge of the
existence of such indemnifiable claim (but in any event prior to the
applicable Expiration Date). Such written notice shall state that it is being
given pursuant to this  _Section 9.3_, specify, in reasonable detail, the
nature and amount of the claim (to the extent they are capable of
determination). If such Indemnifying Party contests such assertion of a claim
by giving such written notice to the Indemnified Party, then the parties
shall act in good faith to reach agreement regarding such claim during a
subsequent sixty (60) day period. If litigation or arbitration between the
parties shall arise with respect to any such claim, the prevailing party
shall be entitled to reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such litigation or arbitration as more fully set forth in
_Section 10.15_.

 

(e) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim may be asserted by notice to the party obligated to indemnify pursuant
to _Section 10.11_. Such notice must be in writing, must set forth in
reasonable detail the facts known by the Indemnified Party relating to

 



65  such claim and amount of the claim (to the extent such amount is capable of
determination) and must include a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises (to the extent such provisions can be determined at that time or a good
faith estimate thereof); _provided_ , _that_ , subject to _Section 9.2(d)_,
failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. For purposes
of this _Section 9.3_, if the Stockholder Parties comprise the Indemnified
Party, any references to the Indemnified Party (in each case except provisions
relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any payments) shall be
deemed to refer to the Representative.

 

9.4 _Determination of Losses_.

 

(a) The amount of any and all Losses under this _Article IX_ shall be
determined net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party
under insurance policies, indemnities or other reimbursement arrangements (not
to include any tax benefits resulting from such Losses other than with respect
to tax benefits that have the result of reducing the amount of cash tax paid
for the taxable year during which the Loss giving rise to the indemnification
payment is incurred) with respect to such Losses net of out-of-pocket costs of
recovery. The Indemnified Party shall seek full recovery under all insurance
policies (or any other contractual source of indemnity or reimbursement)
covering any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not
subject to indemnification hereunder. Each party hereby waives, to the extent
permitted under its applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights
that its insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses. Any
indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes. If an insurance or other recovery
is made by any Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses for which any such
Person has previously been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Person
or Persons that provided such indemnity payments to such Indemnified Party.

(b) Subject to _Section 3.7(f)_, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have
no right to indemnification hereunder with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss
to the extent Parent shall have requested and received a reduction in the
Company Statement or the Parent Closing Statement on account of (but only to
the extent of such reduction) any matter forming the basis for such Loss or
alleged Loss. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any amount is taken
into account as a current liability in the calculation of Net Working Capital
(e.g., as a reserve) or included in Indebtedness, Final Pre-Closing Taxes or
Transaction Costs, such amount shall not be considered a Loss hereunder to the
extent that the amount payable to the Stockholders and/or Optionholders by
Parent pursuant to this Agreement has actually been reduced by such amount.

(c) In no event shall Parent (or any Parent Indemnified Party) be entitled
to recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of punitive damages
(except to the extent that punitive damages are paid to a third party) and no
"multiple of profits", "multiple of revenue", "multiple of cash flow" or
similar valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any
Losses, regardless of whether or not any such multiple or similar valuation
methodology was used by Parent at the time of, or in connection with,
calculating it bid, its proposed purchase price, or its final purchase price.
Furthermore, it is understood that no amounts need to be paid as indemnity
hereunder with respect to a Third Party Claim unless a Loss is suffered or
incurred and the other limitations and conditions set forth in this Agreement
are satisfied. Attorney, consultant, and other professional fees and
disbursements incurred by an indemnifying party in connection with this
_Article IX_ shall be reasonable.

 

(d) The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate all Losses.

 



66 9.5 _Overlapping Indemnification_.

 

(a) To the extent that a Parent Indemnified Party brings a claim for
indemnification with respect to Item 3 on _Schedule 9.1(a)(iv)_ (a " _Parent
Claim_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable Parent Indemnified
Party to, timely assert and reasonably pursue a claim for indemnification
based on the same set of facts as the Parent Claim (a " _Ciboodle Claim_ ")
against Sword Soft Limited, a private limited company incorporated in England
and Wales (company number 06124324) and Sword Group SE, a societas europaea,
registered in Luxembourg (registration number B 168244) (the " _Ciboodle
Sellers_ ") in accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement described in
subsection (h) of _Schedule 5.8_.

 

(b) In addition to asserting any Ciboodle Claim against the Ciboodle Sellers,
the Parent Indemnified Parties may assert a Parent Claim based on the same
breach or set of facts and circumstances against the Representative in respect
thereof under this _Article IX_ ; provided that no Parent Indemnified Party
shall actively pursue the counterpart Parent Claim against the
Representative, which counterpart Parent Claim shall be automatically stayed
during except to the extent necessary to preserve any claims of any Parent
Indemnified Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure of the Ciboodle
Sellers to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to any
portion of a Ciboodle Claim or the Parent Indemnified Parties inability to
satisfy any Losses from the Ciboodle Sellers shall not relieve the
Representative of their indemnification obligations with respect to such
portion of the counterpart Parent Claim or constitute any defense with respect
thereto.

(c) Any amounts recovered from the Ciboodle Sellers by the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount of Losses that
are the basis for the Parent Claim.

 

(d) If the Parent Indemnified Parties have not recovered in full all Losses
sustained or incurred by them resulting from, arising out of or in connection
with Item 3 on _Schedule 9.1(a)(iv)_ following the timely assertion and
reasonable pursuit of a Ciboodle Claim against the Ciboodle Sellers, the
Parent Indemnified Parties may pursue a direct claim against the
Representative for any Losses not recovered by the Ciboodle Sellers subject
to the limitations set forth in this _Article IX_.

(e) If, after the Representative pays the Parent Indemnified Parties for any
Losses resulting from or arising out of the counterpart Parent Claim, the
Ciboodle Sellers pay any amounts to the Parent Indemnified Parties resulting
from or arising out of the counterpart Ciboodle Claim, the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall promptly pay to the Representative an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) the amount received by the Parent Indemnified Parties from the Ciboodle
Sellers in respect of the counterpart Ciboodle Claim and (ii) the amount
received by the Parent Indemnified Parties from the Representative in respect
of the counterpart Parent Claim, in each case, less any reasonable out-of-
pocket legal fees associated with the Ciboodle Claim.

 

ARTICLE X

_MISCELLANEOUS _

10.1 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that the rights of each party to consummate the Transactions are unique and
recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any
party, money damages would be inadequate and the non-breaching party would
have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-
breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity (including monetary
damages, but, in any event, only as such remedies against the Stockholder
Parties or Parent Parties, as applicable are limited by this Agreement), to
enforce their rights and the other partys obligations hereunder not only by
an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for

 



67  specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without
posting of bond or other security). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
agree that no claim for specific performance by the Company and/or the
Representative on behalf of the Company and/or any Stockholder Party may be
made concurrently with a claim for money damages in connection with an
Impermissible Failure to Close (it being understood and agreed (x) that such
claims may be made sequentially to the extent unsuccessful with respect to the
first remedy sought (e.g., the Company may seek specific performance and
later, if such efforts were unsuccessful, may sue for money damages in respect
of an Impermissible Failure to Close) and (y) for the avoidance of doubt,
that the failure of the first claim or the failure to bring both claims
simultaneously shall not prejudice any subsequent claim in any way, _provided_
that the Company shall not be prohibited from seeking fees, costs and
expenses as contemplated by _Section 10.15_). For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event may the Company and/or the Representative, on its own behalf or on
behalf of the Stockholder Parties, obtain both specific performance and such
monetary damages. The parties hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party and
to enforce compliance with their covenants and obligations contained herein.
Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exhaustive of any other
remedy expressly conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party
(including monetary damages, but, in any event, only as such remedies against
any of the Stockholder Parties or Parent Parties, as applicable, are
limited by this Agreement), and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. If, prior to the Outside
Date, the Company brings any Legal Proceeding to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by Parent and/or Merger Sub,
the Outside Date shall (unless otherwise determined by the Company in its sole
discretion) automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time during which
such Legal Proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such
other time period established by the court of competent jurisdiction presiding
over such Legal Proceeding.

 

10.2 _Acknowledgement of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that it has conducted an independent investigation
and verification of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The representations and warranties by the Company in
this Agreement constitute the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Company or any other Person to Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Parent and
Merger Sub understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other
representations and warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied are
specifically disclaimed by the Company and the Stockholders. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub has received certain projections estimates, forecasts and
future plans, including projected statements of operating revenues and income
from operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and certain business plan
information. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and future plans, that Parent and Merger Sub are familiar with
such uncertainties and that each of Parent and Merger Sub is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and future plans so furnished
to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections and forecasts. Accordingly, each of Parent and Merger
Sub hereby acknowledges that none of the Representative, the Stockholders, the
Optionholders or any of their Affiliates, or their respective officers,
directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors
and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Stockholder Parties_ ") is making
any representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and future plans. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied on
any such estimates, projections or other forecasts or future plans. Parent
further agrees, for itself and any of the Parent Parties, that none of the
Stockholder Parties or any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability to any Parent Party or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to Parent or any other Parent Party, or Parents use of, any such
estimates (other than estimates set forth in the Company Statement on which
Parent may rely), projections or other forecasts or future plans.

 



68 10.3 _Non-Recourse_. All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement to
the extent permitted to be made hereunder, may be made only against the
Persons that are expressly identified as parties hereto or the RandW Insurer
or, in the case of the Specified Representations or the representations in the
Letter of Transmittal, the Stockholders. Except as set forth in the preceding
sentence or expressly in this Agreement, no Person who is not a named party
to this Agreement, including any past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, equityholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of any named party to this Agreement ("
_Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of
an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any obligations or
liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its
negotiation or execution. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended
as third-party beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement. Nothing in
this _Section 10.3_ shall preclude or limit Fraud Claims.

 

10.4 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. It is acknowledged by each
of the parties hereto that each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
Representative and Accel-KKR have retained Kirkland and Ellis LLP to act as its
counsel in connection with the Transactions and that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has
not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in connection with the
Transactions and that none of the other parties hereto has the status of a
client of Kirkland and Ellis LLP for conflict of interest or any other purposes
as a result thereof. Parent, Merger Sub, the Representative, the Company, the
Stockholders, the Optionholders and their respective Subsidiaries hereby
agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Stockholder Parties or Parent
Parties, as appropriate, that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and/or its Subsidiaries on
the one hand, and the Representative, Accel-KKR and/or their Affiliates, on
the other hand, Kirkland and Ellis LLP may represent the Representative, Accel-
KKR and/or such Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the
Representative, Accel-KKR and/or such Affiliates may be directly adverse to
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, and even though
Kirkland and Ellis LLP may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in
a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries.
Parent and Merger Sub further agree that, as to all communications among
Kirkland and Ellis LLP, the Representative, Accel-KKR and/or any of their
respective Affiliates that relate in any way to the Transactions
(collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), the attorneyclient
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Accel-KKR and
may be controlled by Accel-KKR and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries. The
Privileged Communications are the property of Accel-KKR, and from and after
the Closing none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any Person purporting to
act on behalf of or through the Company or its Subsidiaries will seek to
obtain such communications, whether by seeking a waiver of the attorney-
client privilege or through other means. As to any such Privileged
Communications prior to the Closing Date, Parent, the Company, and each of its
Subsidiaries together with any of their respective affiliates, Subsidiaries,
successors or assigns, further agree that no such party may use or rely on any
of the Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any of the
parties after the Closing. The Privileged Communications may be used by the
Representative, Accel-KKR and/or any of their respective Affiliates in
connection with any dispute that relates in any way to the Transactions,
including in any claim for indemnification brought by Parent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries and a third party (other
than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates) after
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries may assert the
attorneyclient privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
by Kirkland and Ellis LLP to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Surviving Corporation nor its Subsidiaries may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Representative and Accel-
KKR.

 



69 10.5 _Exclusivity of Agreement_. The parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to
define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the subject
matter of this Agreement exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms
and provisions of this Agreement; and the parties hereto expressly disclaim
that they are owed any duties by the other party not expressly set forth in
this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 10.5_ shall preclude or limit Fraud
Claims. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the sole and
exclusive remedies for any and all claims arising under, out of, or related
to this Agreement against the Stockholder Parties (including any
representations and warranties set forth herein) shall be those remedies
provided in the Letter of Transmittal (i.e., direct claims against
the Stockholders) and _Sections 3.7_ , _4.3_ , _10.1_ , _10.3_ and _Article
IX_ hereof. No Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse,
whether in contract, tort or otherwise against the Stockholder Parties; 
_provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein
shall limit any remedy (whether for damages or specific performance) (i)
following a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
4.1_, against any party hereto from liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement, (ii) against Parent from any liability for Losses to the
Stockholder Parties (or the Company) brought by the Company or the
Representative for any Impermissible Failure to Close subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 4.3_ and (iii) following the Effective
Time, against Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any breach of any
covenant by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. The provisions of this
_Section 10.5_ and the limited remedies provided in _Sections 3.7_ , _4.3_ ,
_10.1_ , _10.3_ and _Article IX_ , were specifically bargained for by the
parties and were taken into account by them in arriving at the Base Purchase
Price and the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

10.6 _No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter_. Parent and Merger Sub shall
not take any action with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries that
would cause the Transactions to constitute part of a transaction that is the
same as, or substantially similar to, the " _Intermediary Transaction Tax
Shelter_ " described in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

10.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other
agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions.

10.8 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (and
the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the documents referred to herein,
including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the entire agreement of the
parties with respect to the Transactions and supersede all prior agreements
(including any letters of intent or term sheets) among the parties with
respect to the Transactions. The parties have voluntarily agreed to define
their rights, liabilities and obligations with respect to the Transactions
exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this
Agreement, and the parties hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed any
duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Furthermore, the parties each hereby acknowledge that this
Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties
derived from arms-length negotiations, and all parties specifically
acknowledge that no party has any special relationship with another party that
would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an
ordinary seller in an arms-length transaction.

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement) shall be governed

 



70  by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to agreements executed and performed entirely within such
State. Any action against any party relating to the foregoing shall be
brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware over any such action (or, if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware determines that it does not have or should
not exercise subject matter jurisdiction of such action, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware). The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection that they may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action brought in such court
or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such action.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto
acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the
Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the Transactions, the
financing commitments, the financing or the performance of services thereunder
or related thereto shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state
or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, and
any appellate court thereof and each party hereto submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court, (ii) not to bring or permit any of their
Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal
Proceeding in any other court, (iii) that service of process, summons, notice
or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses
provided in _Section 10.11_, or in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law, shall be effective service of process against them for any such Legal

Proceeding with respect to the debt Financing Sources shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State that would result in

10.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal,
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

 

10.13 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder may be made by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment
without the required consents shall be void, except (i) Parent or Merger Sub
may assign their rights and obligations hereunder to any of their Affiliates
and (ii) that at and after the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub may
collaterally assign their rights hereunder to any commercial lender or other
debt financing source of Parent and Merger Sub without the Companys consent.
No assignment of any obligations hereunder shall relieve the assigning party
of any such obligations or of any liability for any breach by such party or
its assignee of any such obligations.

 

10.14 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and, except (v)
as set forth in _Section 4.3_, _Section 7.7_, _Section 10.3_ and _Section
10.5_, (w) for the right of the Company (or the Representative) on behalf of
the Stockholders and/or Optionholders to pursue damages (including claims for
damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including _Sections 3.1_ and _3.3_ , to the
Stockholders and Optionholders) pursuant to _Section 4.3_ (whether or not
this agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Section 4.1_ but subject to
the limitations set forth in  _Section 4.3_) or specific performance
pursuant to _Section 10.1_, (x) for

 



73  the right of the Representative on behalf of the Stockholders and
Optionholders to pursue damages after the Closing for the breach of any
covenant or agreement made by Parent to be performed after the Effective
Time, (y) after the Effective Time, if Parent shall not have made payments in
accordance with _Sections 3.1_ , _3.3_ or _3.7_ , the Representative, on
behalf of each Stockholder (and, if applicable, Optionholder) shall have the
right to enforce directly its right to receive the amounts payable pursuant to
_Sections 3.1_ , _3.3_ or _3.7_ , and (z) that the Financing Sources are third
party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any provisions in this Agreement
reflecting the last sentence of _Section 10.9_ hereof, each of which rights
set forth in clauses (w), (x), (y) and (z) hereof are hereby expressly
acknowledged and agreed to by Parent and Merger Sub, and nothing herein,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 

10.15 _Prevailing Party_. In the event any litigation or other court action,
arbitration or similar adjudicatory proceeding (a " _Proceeding_ ") is
commenced or threatened by any party (the " _Claiming Party_ ") hereto to
enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other party (the "
_Defending Party_ "), all fees, costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable and documented attorneys fees and court costs,
incurred by the prevailing party in such Proceeding shall be reimbursed by the
other party; _provided_ , that if a party prevails in part, and loses in
part, in such Proceeding, the court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding
over such Proceeding shall award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and
expenses incurred by each party on an equitable basis. For purposes hereof,
and without limitation, the Defending Party shall be deemed to have prevailed
in any Proceeding described in the immediately preceding sentence if the
Claiming Party commences or threatens any such Proceeding and (i) such
underlying claim(s) are subsequently dropped or voluntarily dismissed, and/or
(ii) the Defending Party defeats any such claim(s).

10.16 _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this Agreement will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person.
The Schedules attached to this Agreement have been arranged for purposes of
convenience in separately titled sections corresponding to sections of this
Agreement. Capitalized terms used in the Schedules and not otherwise defined
therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement. Any information
disclosed in one section of the Schedules shall be deemed to be disclosed as
an exception to any other representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement to the extent that the disclosure is reasonably apparent on its
face, from a reading of such disclosure item, to be an exception to such other
representations and warranties The specification of any dollar amount or the
inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or the Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended
to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so
included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including,
without limitation, whether such amounts or items are required to be
disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary
course of business, and no party will use the fact of the setting of the
amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the
Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described or included in this
Agreement or in any Schedule or Exhibit is or is not required to be
disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed
as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in this
Agreement and in the Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for
purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein
will be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of
any matter whatsoever (including, without limitation, any violation of law or
breach of contract).

10.17 _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby,
this Agreement will govern and control.

 



74 10.18 _Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and
will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto
or thereto will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument will
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent such defense related to lack of authenticity.

10.19 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including by means of facsimile, each of which will be deemed to
be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together,
will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.

 

10.20 _Appointment of Representative_.

 

(a) Each Common Stockholder, by their adoption and approval of this Agreement,
and each Preferred Stockholder and Optionholder hereby irrevocably
constitutes and appoints Accel-KKR Capital Partners III, LP as its true and
lawful agent, attorney-in-fact, proxy and representative and authorizes it for
such Common Stockholder, Preferred Stockholder or Optionholder and in such
Common Stockholders, Preferred Stockholders or Optionholders name, place
and stead, in any and all capacities, to do and perform each and every act and
thing (including executing documents and other instruments) necessary or
desirable to be done in connection with the Transactions, as fully to all
intents and purposes as the undersigned might or could do in person. Each
Common Stockholder, by their adoption and approval of this Agreement, and each
Preferred Stockholder and Optionholder acknowledges and agrees that upon
execution of this Agreement, upon any delivery by the Representative of any
waiver, amendment, agreement, opinion, certificate or other document executed
by Accel-KKR Capital Partners III, LP in its capacity as the Representative,
such Common Stockholder, Preferred Stockholder or Optionholder shall be bound
by such documents or action as fully as if such Common Stockholder, Preferred
Stockholder or Optionholder had executed and delivered such documents.

(b) Each Common Stockholder, by their adoption and approval of this Agreement,
and each Preferred Stockholder and Optionholder agrees that Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by the
Representative, on behalf of the Common Stockholders, Preferred Stockholders
and/or Optionholders, pursuant to  _Section 10.20(a)_ above (each, an "
_Authorized Action_ "), and that each Authorized Action shall be binding on
each Common Stockholder, Preferred Stockholder and/or Optionholder, as
applicable, as fully as if such Common Stockholder, Preferred Stockholder
and/or Optionholder had taken such Authorized Action.

(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby acknowledges and agrees that Accel-KKR
Capital Partners III, LP shall have no liability whatsoever to any other party
hereto in its capacity as the Representative.

 

(d) Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deal
exclusively with the Representative on all matters relating to this
Agreement, the Company Documents and the other agreements contemplated hereby
and thereby and shall be entitled to rely conclusively

 



75  (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed
or purported to be executed on behalf of any Stockholder or Optionholder by
the Representative in connection herewith, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any Stockholder or Optionholder by the
Representative in connection herewith, as fully binding upon such Stockholder
or Optionholder. The Representative may (and each Stockholder and
Optionholder hereby authorizes it to), but shall not be required to, make
claims and seek recourse on behalf of one or more Stockholder Parties as
contemplated by or related to or arising from this Agreement or the other
documents referred to herein or otherwise relating to the Transactions.

(e) Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any Stockholder or Optionholder for any action taken by the Representative
pursuant to this Agreement or any Company Document.

(f) At all times from and after the date of this Agreement, except as set
forth in _Section 7.9_ (Publicity), the Representative shall not disclose any
confidential non-public information it obtains in its capacity as the
Representative hereunder with respect to the Company and Surviving
Corporation, except in each case for information that is in the public domain
other than through conduct of the Representative or as may be legally
required. If the Representative is requested or required (by oral request or
written request for information or documents) in any legal proceeding to
disclose any such confidential information, then the Representative shall
notify Parent promptly in writing (to the extent practicable) of the request
or requirement so that Parent may seek an appropriate protective order at its
cost. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
acknowledge that in the course of the Representatives investment in
the Company, the Representatives exposure to the confidential information of
the Company will likely serve to give the Representative increased knowledge
and understanding of the Companys industry, technology, and business in a way
that cannot be reasonably expected to be forgotten or separated from the
Representatives overall knowledge base. Accordingly, the Representative will
not be in breach of this Agreement by reason of remembering, retaining, or
making use of general ideas or general concepts that may form a part of the
Representatives increased knowledge as described in the preceding sentence.

 

(g) Each Common Stockholder, by their adoption and approval of this Agreement,
and each Preferred Stockholder and Optionholder agrees to reimburse and
indemnity the Representative for any Representative Indemnification pursuant
to _Section 3.8_.

10.21 _Payments to Optionholders_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Representative agrees to promptly deliver to the
account or accounts of one or more of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, as instructed by Parent, all amounts paid to the Representative
on behalf of the Optionholders pursuant to this Agreement, and Parent agrees
to cause the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries to promptly pay
such amounts to the Optionholders in cash, through Parents, the Surviving
Corporations or one of its Subsidiaries payroll systems or otherwise, less
applicable withholding taxes, in each case allocated in accordance with the
Representatives instructions.

 

10.22 _Consents_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that certain consents to
the Transactions may be required from parties to contracts, leases, licenses
or other agreements to which the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries is
a party (including the Significant Contracts) and such consents have not been
obtained as of the date of this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub agree
and acknowledge that, except as set forth in this Agreement (including any
breach of _Section 7.3_), none of the Stockholder Parties will have any
liability whatsoever to Parent or Merger Sub (and Parent and Merger Sub will
not be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in
connection with the Transactions or because of the default, acceleration or
termination of any such contract, lease, license or other agreement as a
result thereof. Parent and Merger

 



76  Sub further agree that, except as set forth in this Agreement (including any
breach of _Section 7.3_), no representation, warranty or covenant of the
Company contained herein will be breached or deemed breached and no condition
of Parent or Merger Sub will be deemed not to be satisfied as a result of the
failure to obtain any consent or as a result of any such default, acceleration
or termination or any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation
commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any such default,
acceleration or termination.
