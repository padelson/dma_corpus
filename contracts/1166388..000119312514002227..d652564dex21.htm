Subsidiaries, the Representative and Accel-KKR have retained Kirkland&nbsp;&amp; Ellis LLP to act as its counsel in connection with the Transactions and that Kirkland&nbsp;&amp; Ellis LLP has not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in
connection with the Transactions and that none of the other parties hereto has the status of a client of Kirkland&nbsp;&amp; Ellis LLP for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Parent, Merger Sub, the Representative, the
Company, the Stockholders, the Optionholders and their respective Subsidiaries hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Stockholder Parties or Parent Parties, as appropriate, that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and/or its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Representative, Accel-KKR and/or their Affiliates, on the other hand, Kirkland&nbsp;&amp; Ellis LLP may represent the Representative, Accel-KKR and/or such
Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the Representative, Accel-KKR and/or such Affiliates may be directly adverse to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, and even though Kirkland&nbsp;&amp; Ellis LLP may have
represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub further agree that, as to all
communications among Kirkland&nbsp;&amp; Ellis LLP, the Representative, Accel-KKR and/or any of their respective Affiliates that relate in any way to the Transactions (collectively, the &#147;<U>Privileged Communications</U>&#148;), the
attorney&#150;client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Accel-KKR and may be controlled by Accel-KKR and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries. The Privileged
Communications are the property of Accel-KKR, and from and after the Closing none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through the Company or its Subsidiaries will seek to obtain such communications,
whether by seeking a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or through other means. As to any such Privileged Communications prior to the Closing Date, Parent, the Company, and each of its Subsidiaries together with any of their respective
affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, further agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any of the parties after the Closing. The Privileged Communications may be
used by the Representative, Accel-KKR and/or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with any dispute that relates in any way to the Transactions, including in any claim for indemnification brought by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries and a third party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney&#150;client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Kirkland&nbsp;&amp; Ellis LLP to such third party; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that neither the Surviving Corporation nor its
Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Representative and Accel-KKR. </P>
