Acquired Entity for any taxable years or periods beginning on or before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (Straddle Period) and shall
cause the relevant Acquired Entity, as applicable, to remit any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns (Straddle Period Tax Returns). The Purchaser shall

AILP, ALP or Heartland Transmission L.P. ending on or before the Closing Date

Such notice shall set out such information with respect to such notice,
inquiry or Tax Assessment as is then available (without the incurring of

Sellers) to the Purchaser or any of the Acquired Entities. The Sellers shall
have the right to undertake and control any proceeding, hearing, complaint,
claim, demand, objection or other defence of or with respect to any such

Closing Date, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall jointly control any
proceeding, hearing, complaint, claim, demand, objection or other defence of

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, for greater certainty,
that (i) a continuing condition for a period that does not exceed three (3)
years after the Closing Date that the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries not
commit a sanctionable offense shall be considered a reasonable condition,
unless the inability of obtaining the lifting of the World Bank sanction
results from any acts or sanctionable practices of the Purchaser Guarantor or
any one of its Subsidiaries, and (ii) the Purchaser Guarantor and each of its
Subsidiaries, other than the Purchaser and its respective Subsidiaries, shall
not be required, under any circumstance, to submit to any condition or

they used prior to Closing to prevent any AUC Disallowance to occur, and the
Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate and take such other reasonable steps
as are necessary to enable and cause (subject to Applicable Law) the Operating
Entities to conduct themselves as aforementioned, in each case, including

success and whether such review or proceeding should be carried out.

For the purposes of Section 9.3(c), "Operating Entities" shall include their
respective successors and assigns.

Indemnification Procedure - Third Party Claims

---|--- 

(a)

|

If any claim, assertion or proceeding by or in respect of a third party (a
Third Party Claim) is made or commenced against the Purchaser, the Sellers,
942064 Alberta Ltd., a Purchaser Indemnified Person or a Sellers Indemnified
Person, as the case may be, (an Indemnified Person) in respect of which the
Indemnified Person proposes to demand indemnification from a Party pursuant to
Sections 9.1 or 9.2 (the Indemnifying Party), the Indemnified Person shall
give notice to that effect together with particulars of the Third Party Claim
to its Indemnity Representative and the Indemnifying Party with reasonable
promptness. The failure to give, or delay in giving, such notice will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except and only to the
extent of any prejudice caused to the Indemnifying Party by such failure or
delay. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the Indemnity Representative given
not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice described in Section

acknowledge in writing complete responsibility for and agree to indemnify the
Indemnified Person in respect of such Third Party Claim.

the Indemnifying Party shall actively and diligently proceed with the defence,
compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim at its sole costs and
expenses, retaining counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnity
Representative; and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the Indemnifying Party shall not need to obtain the consent of the Indemnity
Representative to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim unless such judgement or settlement imposes a
restriction on the Indemnity Representative or it entails costs for it, in
which event such consent may not be unreasonably or arbitrarily withheld or
delayed. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of a Third Party Claim in
accordance with Section 9.4(b), the Indemnified Person and the Indemnity
Representative may retain separate co-counsel at their sole cost and expense,
and may participate in the defence of the Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

The Indemnified Person and the Indemnity Representative shall, at their sole
costs and expenses, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and use their
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to make available to the Indemnifying Party
all relevant information in their possession or under their control (provided
that it does not cause either of them to breach any confidentiality
obligations) and shall take such other steps as are, in the reasonable opinion
of counsel for the Indemnifying Party, necessary to enable the Indemnifying
Party to conduct such defence. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

If (i) the Indemnifying Party fails to give the Indemnity Representative the
notice required in Section 9.4(b), or (ii) the Indemnifying Party breaches any
of its other obligations under this Section 9.4, the Indemnity Representative
may assume control of the defence, compromise or settlement of the Third Party
Claim and retain counsel as may appear advisable, acting reasonably, the whole
at the Indemnifying Party's sole costs and expenses. The Indemnifying Party
shall, at its sole costs and expenses, cooperate fully with the Indemnity
Representative and use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to make available
to the Indemnity Representative all relevant information in its possession or
under its control and take such other steps as are, in the reasonable opinion
of counsel for the Indemnity Representative, necessary to enable the Indemnity
Representative to conduct the defence. The Indemnifying Party shall reimburse
the Indemnified Person and the Indemnity Representative promptly and
periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party Claim
(including legal fees and expenses), and shall remain responsible for any
Damages the Indemnified Person and the Indemnity Representative may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, or relating to, the Third Party Claim to the
fullest extent provided in this Article 9. 

| 
---|--- 

9.5

|

Duty to Mitigate and Subrogation 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Nothing in this Agreement in any way restricts or limits the general
obligation at law of an Indemnified Person to mitigate any Damages which it
may suffer or incur by reason of the breach by an Indemnifying Party of any
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or obligation of the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents.
The amount of Damages under this Article 9 will be determined net of (i) any
Tax benefits realizable by any Indemnified Person in relation to any such
Damages (including any Tax benefits arising from the deductibility or
amortization of any such Damages or from a potential allowance, refund,
credit, deduction or loss carry-over), and (ii) any amounts recovered or
recoverable by the Indemnified Person under insurance policies, indemnities,
reimbursement arrangements or similar agreements with respect to such Damages.
The Indemnified Person shall take all appropriate steps to enforce such
recovery. 
| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The Indemnified Person shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, subrogate its rights to the Indemnifying Party and will make all
counterclaims and join in any litigation all other Persons as may be
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party, the whole at the costs and
expenses of the Indemnifying Party.

Section 9.6.

---|--- 

(a)

|

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 9 :

payments are made hereunder in respect of any matter relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, no duplicate recovery shall be available hereunder; 

| 
---|---

|

for greater certainty, Damages (which for greater certainty do not include AUC

Sellers and 942064 Alberta Ltd. in accordance with Section 9.3(a), exceed, in
the aggregate, an amount equal to at least one percent (1.0%) of the
Acquisition Price, in which case the liability of the applicable Indemnifying
Party is solely for the amount of such Eligible Claims in excess of one
percent (1.0%) of the Acquisition Price;

damages calculated by reference to any Acquisition Price methodology. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, solely for purposes of
calculating Damages under this Article 9, any qualifications or limitations
set forth in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement as to

similar materiality qualifier) contained therein shall be disregarded. 
| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Any payments by one Party to another for the benefit of the other Party made
pursuant to this Article 9 shall be treated by the Parties for all purposes as
an adjustment to the Acquisition Price.

|

For greater certainty, the amounts and percentages set forth in Sections
9.7(a)(iv), 9.7(a)(v) and 9.7(a)(vi) apply once to the Sellers and 942064

provisions of Section 9.5 and 9.7, mutatis mutandis.

| 
---|--- 

9.9

|

Exceptions to Indemnification 

Neither the Purchaser nor any Purchaser Indemnified Person is entitled to any
claim or other recourse against the Sellers or 942064 Alberta Ltd. nor do the
Sellers or 942064 Alberta Ltd. have any liability in connection with any
breach of any obligation, condition or covenant of the Sellers or 942064
Alberta Ltd. in this Agreement or any Transaction Document, occurring during

| 
---|--- 

9.10

|

Indemnification Sole Remedy 

The rights and remedies that a Party may have against the other Party for a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation under this
Agreement or any Transaction Document are exclusively governed by this
Agreement; provided, for greater certainty, that with respect to the failure
of such Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the
Closing Date where all conditions to Closing in favour of such Party have been
met in accordance with the terms hereof (except for conditions not being met
as a result of a breach resulting from such Party's actions or omissions), the
provisions of Section 9.11 shall govern.

| 
---|--- 

9.11

|

Equitable Remedies 

Each Party agrees that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that a
Party hereto does not consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the
Closing Date and as set forth herein where all conditions to Closing in favour
of such Party have been met in accordance with the terms hereof (in this
Section 9.11, a Failure to Close). In this case, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent such Failure to Close and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in order for Closing to
occur, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each Party agrees that, in connection with a Failure to Closing by
such Party, it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has
an adequate 

remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent a Failure to Close and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement in order for Closing to occur shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

| 
---|--- 

9.12

|

Agency for Non-Parties 

To the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement,
each Party hereby accepts each indemnity in favour of its indemnified Persons
who are not Parties as agent and trustee for and on their behalf. A Party may
enforce an indemnity in favour of any of that Party's indemnified Persons on
behalf of each such Person.
