and deliver to Penton all of his DII Shares free and clear of any mortgage,

consideration specified below in this section 2.   (b) PURCHASE AND SALE OF

of this Agreement, Penton will cause DII to purchase from the Sellers, and
the Sellers will sell, assign, transfer and deliver to DII, all of their
limited partnership interests in DCI free and clear of any mortgage, pledge,
lien, encumbrance, charge or other security interest for the consideration
specified below in this section 2.   7  12   (c) PURCHASE PRICE. (i) (i)
In full consideration for the transfer of Duke\'s DII Shares and the
Sellers\' DCI partnership interests, Penton will deliver and pay to Sellers a
total purchase price of up to $150 million in cash (the Purchase Price). The
Purchase Price is payable in two parts as follows: (1) at Closing, Penton
will pay to the Sellers $100 million in cash, subject to the adjustment
provided in section 2(g)(i) below (the Cash Payment), by wire transfer or
delivery of other immediately available funds and (2) Contingent Payments of
up to $50 million, if earned, due over a period following Closing
as described in this section 2(c). The Contingent Payments consist of a
Revenue Contingent Payment and an EBITDA Contingent Payment, each defined
below, to be paid by Penton, if earned, on or before March 31 following the
end of each of the calendar years 2000, 2001 and 2002 (each, a "Yearly
Contingent Payment Period" and collectively the "Contingent Payment Period,")
and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 2(c). The
Parties agree that the consideration for the DII Shares consists solely of a
portion of the Cash Payment and none of the Contingent Payments. The
consideration for the DCI interests is the balance of the Cash Payment and
all of the Contingent Payments. The final allocation of the Purchase Price
among the Sellers shall be determined in a writing executed by all Sellers
and Penton on or before two business days before the Closing Date. The
Sellers will, at Closing, assign their rights to receive the Contingent
Payments to a newly formed limited liability company (New LLC) that will be
wholly owned by Sellers. Penton shall pay all Contingent Payments, if earned,
by wire transfer to New LLC. Sellers acknowledge that payment of the
Contingent Payment to New LLC pursuant to this section 2(c) is in complete
satisfaction of Penton\'s obligations under this section 2(c) to pay
the Purchase Price to Sellers. Any Contingent Payment that is not paid when
due shall accrue interest from the due date until paid at the Applicable
Rate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the amount of any Contingent Payment is in
dispute, it will not be   8  13  considered due until the later of March
31 of the year following the end of the applicable Yearly Contingent Payment
Period and five business days after resolution of such dispute.   (ii) (A)
The "Revenue Contingent Payment" is equal to 24% of the amount by which
revenue (as adjusted as provided by section 2(c)(vi) hereof) generated by the
business of the Companies and the DCI Subsidiary (the Business) in respect of
such year exceeds $50 million; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the total
cumulative amount of the Revenue Contingent Payment that may be earned during
the Contingent Payment Period will not exceed $30 million; PROVIDED, FURTHER,
that if the total cumulative amount of the Revenue Contingent Payment earned
during the Contingent Payment Period does not equal at least $15 million, an
additional Yearly Contingent Payment Period, calendar year 2003, will be
added to the Contingent Payment Period to achieve up to, but not more than, a
total cumulative Revenue Contingent Payment of $15 million. For example, the
annual Revenue Contingent Payments for 2000, 2001, 2002 and, if applicable,
2003, would be as follows if the revenues of the Business were in the amounts
indicated below (subject, however, to the $30 million maximum Revenue
Contingent Payment amount):   9  14     ($million)   Calendar
Years  2000 2001 2002 2003  ~~   Revenue $54.0 $70.0 $90.0 $110.0  Less

$15.0  Contingent Payments, \'00-\'02 12.96  Payment in 2003: 2.04    
The amount of any Revenue Contingent Payment earned will be reduced by
any amounts that are due to Penton pursuant to section 2(f) or section 10(f)
hereof. Revenue, for purposes of this section 2(c), will be determined in
accordance with GAAP on an accrual basis, consistently applied by Penton from
period to period in a manner consistent with DCI\'s accounting practices as
reflected in the Financial Statements if DCI\'s accounting practices are
consistent with GAAP.   (B) The "EBITDA Contingent Payment" is equal to 56%
of the amount by which EBITDA (as adjusted as provided by section 2(c)(vi)
hereof) of the Business in respect of such year exceeds $8 million; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the total cumulative amount of the EBITDA Contingent Payment
that may be earned during the Contingent Payment Period will not exceed $20
million. For example, the annual EBITDA Contingent Payments for 2000, 2001
and 2002   10  15  would be as follows if the EBITDA of the Business were
in the amounts indicated below (subject, however, to the $20 million maximum
EBITDA Contingent Payment amount):   ($million)   Calendar Years  2000
2001 2002 EBITDA $9.0 $14.0 $20.0 Less: minimum required 8.0 8.0 8.0 Excess
over minimum 1.0 6.0 12.0 Factor .56 .56 .56 Contingent payment earned $ .56
$ 3.36 $ 6.72 Cumulative payments .56 3.92 10.64    (C) "EBITDA" means for
any fiscal period, the sum of net income determined in accordance with GAAP
on an accrual basis, consistently applied by Penton from period to period in
a manner consistent with DCI\'s accounting practices as reflected in the
Financial Statements if DCI\'s accounting practices are consistent with GAAP,
plus, to the extent deducted in computing net income, interest expense,
income tax expense, all depreciation and, without duplication, all
amortization, plus or minus, as the case may be, other extraordinary income
or expense items, whether unrelated to the operation of the Business or
incurred in the usual and ordinary course of the operation of the Business.
The EBITDA of the Business will be determined initially by
Penton. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the calculation of EBITDA of the
Business for purposes of this subsection will not include allocations of
Penton\'s general corporate overhead costs except as provided herein, but
will include (x) operating expenses directly related to the Business
including, without limitation, (i) retirement and welfare plan contribution
costs for employees involved in management and operation of the Business,
(ii) casualty and liability insurance premiums allocable to operation of the
Business, (iii) employee costs for personnel whose work is principally
related to operation of the Business, and (iv) other charges incurred by
Penton in the ordinary course of business of operating the Business that
may   11  16  differ in amount, nature and type from those previously
incurred by DCI in operating the Business, (y) general and administrative
expenses directly related to the Business, and (z) indirect services,
including accounting and services currently performed by third party vendors
(other than those of the type set forth in (x) and (y) above), to the extent
such costs and expenses do not exceed DCI\'s current cost for such services.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, EBITDA of the Business will
account for any cost savings realized as a result of the Business being
operated by DII as a subsidiary of Penton, including by using services
provided by Penton.   (iii) If additional working capital is required to
expand the Business, advances by Penton for such purposes will bear interest
at the average borrowing rate from time to time of Penton. Such interest
charge will be deducted in determining EBITDA.   (iv) Penton shall provide
its initial determination of revenue and EBITDA of the Business for the
previous Yearly Contingent Payment Period to DCI within 60 days of the end of
the previous Yearly Contingent Payment Period (the Revenue/EBITDA
Determination). Penton shall include in the Revenue/EBITDA Determination an
unaudited operating profit and loss statement of the Business for the
respective Contingent Payment Period, certified by the chief
financial officer of Penton as being in accordance with GAAP on an accrual
basis, consistently applied by Penton from period to period in a manner
consistent with DCI\'s accounting practices as reflected in the Financial
Statements if DCI\'s accounting practices are consistent with GAAP. Unless
Duke, within fifteen business days after receipt of the Revenue/EBITDA
Determination, notifies Penton that it objects to the computation of revenue
and/or EBITDA as set forth in the Revenue/EBITDA Determination, the
Revenue/EBITDA Determination will be binding upon the parties for such Yearly
Contingent Payment Period. If   12  17  Duke objects to Penton\'s
calculation of revenue and/or EBITDA as set forth in the Revenue/EBITDA
Determination, not later than fifteen business days following delivery to
Sellers of the Revenue/EBITDA Determination, Duke shall notify Penton in
writing of such objection (the Objection). The Objection must specify (a) the
amount of the proposed adjustment to revenue and/or EBITDA as set forth in
the Revenue/EBITDA Determination; (b) the item(s) to which such
Objection relates; and (c) the facts and circumstances supporting the
Objection. During the 10 business-day period following the delivery to Penton
of any Objection, Penton and Duke will discuss Duke\'s proposals in the
Objection and endeavor in good faith to reach agreement upon appropriate
adjustments to the Revenue/EBITDA Determination. If Penton and Duke are
unable to agree upon the revenue and/or the EBITDA for the previous Yearly
Contingent Payment Period during such 10 business-day period, then Penton and
Duke will jointly engage a mutually acceptable, independent accounting firm
to resolve the dispute in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth
in section 2(f)(ii).   (v) Sellers acknowledge that Penton will own and
control the Business and that, after the Closing, Penton may operate the
Business in such manner as it determines to be in its best interest;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Penton shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maximize revenue and EBITDA of the Business. Throughout the Contingent
Payment Period, Penton will promptly provide to Duke copies of all written
reports, financial statements, projections, budgets, studies and other
similar analysis concerning DII, the DCI Subsidiary or the Business made
available to management of the Companies.   (vi) If Penton, the Companies or
the DCI Subsidiary sell or in anyway transfer (i) control of any of the
Companies and the DCI Subsidiary (a Sold Company) or (ii) any asset or group
of assets comprising a magazine, newsletter, web site or other business unit
of the   13  18  Business acquired from Sellers as the Business existed
as of the Closing Date (a Sold Business Unit) during the Contingent Payment
Period to a Person that is not controlled by, under common control with, or
controlling Penton, then, in calculating the Revenue Contingent Payment and
the EBITDA Contingent Payment, the actual revenue and EBITDA of the Business
will be increased by the annualized amount of revenue and EBITDA,
respectively, contributed by the Sold Company or Sold Business Unit to the
Business during the most recent 12-month period before completion of such
sale or transfer multiplied by the average annual growth rate of such Sold
Company or Sold Business Unit during the most recent 24-month period before
completion of such sale or transfer. For example, if (i) the Sold Company or
Sold Business Unit contributed $10 million of revenue and $1 million of
EBITDA during the most recent 12-month period before the sale is completed,
(ii) the average annual growth rate for such Sold Company or Sold Business
Unit over the 24-month period before the sale is completed is 10% and (iii)
the sale is completed on September 30, 2001, then (x) the actual revenue of
the Business for the 2001 Yearly Contingent Period will be increased by
$2.75 million ($10 million x 10% growth rate (1.1 factor) x 0.25 (3 mos/12
mos)) and the actual revenue of the Business for the 2002 Yearly Contingent
Period will be increased by $11 million ($10 million x 10% x 1.0 (12 mos/12
mos)) and (y) the actual EBITDA of the Business for the 2001 Yearly
Contingent Period will be increased by $275,000 ($1 million x 10% x .25) and
the actual EBITDA of the Business for the 2002 Yearly Contingent Period will
be increased by $1.1 million ($1 million x 10% x 1.0). Any sales or transfers
to a Person that is controlled by, under common control with or controlling
Penton will not affect the calculation of revenue or EBITDA for purposes of

Parties may mutually determine (the Closing Date).   (e) DELIVERIES AT THE
CLOSING. At the Closing, (i) Sellers will deliver to Penton, or DII as its

PRICE ADJUSTMENT. (i) (i) The Purchase Price will be increased by the amount
by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds zero or decreased by the amount
by which the Closing Working Capital is less than zero. An estimate of
Closing Working Capital shall be determined in good faith by
Sellers immediately prior to Closing (Estimated Closing Working Capital) and
used in determining the Purchase Price payable at Closing pending a final,
post-Closing, determination in accordance with this section 2(f).   (ii)
Within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, Penton at its expense, shall
prepare and deliver to Sellers a balance sheet of DCI prepared in accordance
with GAAP,   15  20   as used for the Financial Statements as of the
close of business on the last business day immediately preceding the Closing
Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the Closing occurs within the first ten
days of the prior month end, then the balance sheet will be prepared as of
the close of business on the last business day of the month end prior to
Closing (the Closing Balance Sheet). Closing Working Capital will be the
Working Capital reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet. Working Capital means
current assets minus current liabilities, excluding (i) any deferred
subscription revenue, (ii) any accrued expense relative to the Duke
Communications International, L.L.L.P. Equity Rights Appreciation Plan, and
(iii) any current liabilities of DCI or DII retained by the Sellers or
against which the Sellers are obligated to indemnify Penton and DII in
accordance with this Agreement, but including as a current liability the
long-term portion of the Promissory Notes dated April 7, 2000, and August 15,
2000, payable to First National Bank. Within 45 calendar days after Penton\'s
delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet, Duke shall deliver to Penton a written
statement describing the objections (if any) to the Closing Balance Sheet. If
Duke does not deliver a written statement within those 45 days, the Closing
Working Capital reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet will be final
and binding. If Duke does deliver a written statement within those 45
calendar days, Duke and Penton shall attempt to resolve any disputed items,
but if within 60 calendar days of Duke\'s delivery of a statement of
objections to Penton any disputes remain open, Duke and Penton shall select a
mutually acceptable independent accounting firm to resolve said disputes. If
Penton and Duke are unable to mutually agree on such an accounting firm
within ten calendar days, an accounting firm will be selected by lot from
among the "Big 5" after eliminating any Big 5 firms representing a Party and
after eliminating one firm designated as objectionable by each of Duke on the
one hand and Penton on the other hand. The Parties shall cause said firm to
resolve any disputed items as soon as   16  21  practicable and the
determination of that firm shall be final and binding. Said firm will make
its determination in accordance with GAAP, as used in the Most Recent
Financial Statements based solely upon the presentations by Penton and Duke
and only with respect to the differences submitted by Penton and Duke.
The determination by said firm may not be for an amount that is outside of
the range of Penton\'s and Duke\'s disagreement or consider items that are
not in dispute. The costs and expenses incurred in connection with a
determination by the selected firm shall be allocated by that firm, in its
discretion, in proportion to the relative success of the Parties as to the
dispute.   (iii) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than five
calendar days, after the Closing Working Capital has been finally determined
pursuant to this section 2(f), the difference between Closing Working Capital
and Estimated Closing Working Capital, plus simple interest on that amount at
the Applicable Rate from Closing to the date of payment, shall be paid by
Penton (in the case of a positive difference) or by the Sellers (in the case
of a negative difference) to the other Party as the adjustment to the Cash
Payment portion of the Purchase Price   3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Sellers at any time
prior to the Closing (A) in the event Sellers have breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement in
any material respect, Penton has notified Sellers of the breach, and the
breach has continued without cure for a period of 30 days after the notice
of   50  55  breach or (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before September 30, 2000, by reason of the failure of any condition
precedent under section 7(a) hereof (unless the failure results primarily
from Penton itself breaching any representation, warranty, or covenant
contained in this Agreement);   (iii) Sellers may terminate this Agreement
by giving written notice to Penton at any time prior to the Closing (A) in
the event Penton has breached any representation, warranty, or covenant
contained in this Agreement in any material respect, the Sellers have
notified Penton of the breach, and the breach has continued without cure for
a period of 30 days after the notice of breach or (B) if the Closing shall
not have occurred on or before September 30, 2000, by reason of the failure
of any condition precedent under section 7(b) hereof (unless the failure
results primarily from the Sellers breaching any representation, warranty, or
covenant contained in this Agreement); and   (iv) either Party may terminate
this Agreement if any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental
agency shall have issued an order, decree or injunction or taken any other
action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree or
injunction or other action shall have become final and nonappealable.   (b)
EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to
section 8(a) above, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder
shall terminate (other than the confidentiality provisions contained in
section 6(e) above, the obligations described in this section 8(b) and the
provisions of sections 11(b) and 11(l), which shall survive termination).  
9. POST-CLOSING COVENANTS. The Parties agree as follows with respect to
the period following the Closing.   51  56   (a) GENERAL. In case at any
time after the Closing any further action is necessary to carry out the
purposes of the this Agreement, each of the Parties will take such further
action (including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and
documents) as the other Party reasonably may request, all at the sole cost
and expense of the requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled
to indemnification therefor under section 10 below). Sellers acknowledge and
agree that from and after the Closing Penton will be entitled to possession
of all documents, books, records (including tax records), agreements, and
financial data of any sort, except any contained in the Excluded
Assets, relating to DCI, DII and the DCI Subsidiary.   (b) LITIGATION
SUPPORT. In the event and for so long as any Party actively is contesting or
defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation,
charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with (i) any transaction
contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving any of the Companies and the DCI Subsidiary, each of the other
Parties will cooperate with the contesting or defending Party and its counsel
in the contest or defense, make available its personnel, and provide such
testimony and access to its books and records as shall be necessary in
connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of
the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party
is entitled to indemnification therefor under section 10 below).   52 
57   (c) TAX ELECTION.   (i) At Penton\'s request, DII and Duke will join
with Penton in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and
any corresponding election under state, local, and foreign tax law) with
respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of DII hereunder (a Section
338(h)(10) Election). Duke will include any income, gain, loss, deduction or
other tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on his Tax
Return to the extent required by applicable law. Duke will also pay any Tax
imposed on DII attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election,
including, but not limited to, (1) any Tax imposed under Section 1374, or (2)
any state, local or foreign Tax imposed on DII\'s gain.   (ii) At Penton\'s
request, DII and the Sellers will cause DCI to make an election under Section
754 of the Code (and any corresponding election under state, local, and
foreign tax law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of DII
and the DCI Interests hereunder (a Section 754 Election).   (iii) To the
extent an allocation of the Purchase Price (and any other relevant item)
among the DCI assets is required for Tax purposes, the allocation shall be
based on the fair market values of the assets as determined by Penton and
none of Penton, DCI, DII, and the Sellers will take a position
inconsistent with that determination on any Tax Returns (including amended
returns and claims for refund) or report.   (d) TAX MATTERS. The following
provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as between Penton
and Sellers for certain tax matters respecting the DCI, DII and the DCI
Subsidiary following the Closing Date:   (i) TAX PERIODS ENDING ON OR BEFORE
THE CLOSING DATE. Sellers shall prepare and file all Tax Returns for all
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed   53 
58  after the Closing Date, including the income Tax Returns of DII and DCI
for the short period ending on the Closing Date. Sellers shall permit Penton
to review each such Tax Return prior to filing and shall make such revisions
to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Penton. If a Section
338(h)(10) Election is made, the DII Income Tax Return for the short period
ending on the Closing Date shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or
other tax item that results from such election.   (ii) TAX PERIODS
BEGINNING BEFORE AND ENDING AFTER THE CLOSING DATE. Penton shall prepare and
file any Tax Returns of the Companies and the DCI Subsidiary for Tax periods
which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date. Sellers
shall pay to Penton within 15 calendar days after the date on which Taxes are
paid with respect to such periods an amount equal to the portion of such
Taxes which relates to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date to the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the reserve for
Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established
to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face
of the Closing Balance Sheet. For purposes of this Section, in the case of
any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of
such Tax which relates to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Income Taxes, be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire Taxable period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based
upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date.
Any credits relating to a Taxable period that begins before   54 
59  and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though
the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a
manner consistent with prior practice of the Companies and the DCI
Subsidiary.   (iii) REFUNDS AND TAX BENEFITS. Any Tax refunds that are
received by Penton, the Companies or the DCI Subsidiary, and any amounts
credited against Tax to which Penton, the Companies or the DCI Subsidiary
become entitled, that relate to Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or
before the Closing Date shall be for the account of Sellers, and Penton shall
pay over to the respective Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such
credit within 15 calendar days after receipt or entitlement thereto. In
addition, to the extent that a claim for refund or a proceeding results in a
payment or credit against Tax by a taxing authority to Penton, the Companies
or the DCI Subsidiary of any amount accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet,
Penton shall pay such amount to the respective Sellers within 15 calendar
days after receipt or entitlement thereto.   (iv) COOPERATION ON TAX
MATTERS. Penton, for itself and on behalf of the Companies and the DCI
Subsidiary, and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns of the Companies or the DCI Subsidiary pursuant to this Section and
any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the
Companies or the DCI Subsidiary. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records
and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation,
or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Penton shall cause DII, DCI and the DCI   55 
60  Subsidiary (A) to retain all books and records with respect to the
DCI Subsidiary relating to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Taxing Authority, and (B) to give Sellers reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
Sellers so requests, Penton shall cause DCI, DII or the DCI Subsidiary, as
the case may be, to allow Sellers to take possession of such books and
records. Penton and Sellers shall, upon request, use reasonable efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).   (v) CERTAIN REIMBURSEMENTS BY PENTON.
Penton will reimburse Sellers for up to the first $500,000 of interest
expense incurred by Sellers under section 453A of the Code with respect to
the EBITDA Contingent Payments provided in the Purchase Price. The Parties
agree that the interest expense shall be determined by Sellers in accordance
with Code section 453A, and the regulations thereunder; provided, however,
that the "applicable percentage" defined in section 453A (c) (4) shall be
deemed to be 100%. Penton shall reimburse Sellers for such interest charges
within 15 calendar days after notice from Duke of the Sellers\' payment of
such amounts, which notice shall contain Sellers\' calculation of the
interest charges, including reasonable supporting documentation, and proof of
payment.   (e) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS. Penton will ensure that any
Employee Benefit Plans it adopts with respect to the employees of DCI or the
DCI Subsidiary treat employment with any of the Companies and the DCI
Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date the same as employment with   56 
61  any of Penton and the DCI Subsidiary from and after the Closing Date
for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that there shall be no benefit accrual under the Penton Media, Inc.
Retirement Plan or any other "employee pension benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA.   10. REMEDIES FOR BREACHES OF THIS AGREEMENT.  
(a) SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations
and warranties of Sellers contained in the Agreement shall survive the
Closing and continue in full force and effect for a period of eighteen months
thereafter except (i) those representations and warranties made in section
4(k), (v) and (x), which representations and warranties and any related claim
or action shall survive the Closing until 30 days following the applicable
period of limitations on assessment (including, without limitation, any
extensions thereof) has expired and (ii) those representations and warranties
made in section 3, section 4(a), (b), (d), (e), (f) and (i), which
representations and warranties and any related causes of action will survive
the Closing forever. The representations and warranties of Penton contained
in this Agreement will survive the Closing and continue in full force and
effect for a period of eighteen months thereafter, except those
representations and warranties made in section 5(a), (b) and (d), which
representations and warranties and any related causes of action shall survive
the Closing forever.   (b) INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS FOR BENEFIT OF PENTON.
(i) (i) Sellers will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless Penton
from the following: (1) any liability of DCI, DII or the DCI Subsidiary under
the DCI Equity Appreciation Rights Plan, (2) any liability of DCI, DII or the
DCI Subsidiary arising out of any pending or actually threatened Litigation,
(3) any liability of Sellers, DCI, DII or the DCI Subsidiary for costs and

to employees of DCI, DII or the DCI Subsidiary, (4) any liability
or obligation of Sellers, DCI, DII or the DCI Subsidiary under this Agreement
(or under any side agreement between any of them on the one hand and Penton

than the Consulting Agreement, which will be governed by its terms), (5) any
liability or obligation of DCI, DII or the DCI Subsidiary arising under
Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements, (6) any liability of any of
DCI, DII or the DCI Subsidiary for any Taxes imposed on or asserted against

Subsidiary may be liable in respect of the property, income or operations of
any of DCI, DII or the DCI Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and (7)
any liability or obligation of any of DCI, DII or the DCI Subsidiary that may
arise out of the matters described in Section 4(a)(1) of the Disclosure
Schedule.   (ii) In the event Sellers breach any of their
representations, warranties, and covenants contained in this Agreement (other
than section 4 (i), the breach of which is covered in (iii) below) or in any
agreement or certificate delivered at Closing in accordance with this
Agreement, then Sellers jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold
harmless Penton from and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences
(except as limited in section 10(b)(iv)) Penton may suffer as a result of the
breach through and after the date of the claim for indemnification (including
any Adverse Consequences Penton may suffer after the end of eighteen months
with respect to those representations and warranties whose survival is
limited to eighteen months); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, for purposes of this
provision, with respect to any representation or warranty made by Sellers in
section 3 or section 4, which by its terms contains any qualification or
limitation with respect to knowledge or materiality, such misrepresentation
or inaccuracy thereof will be deemed to have occurred (and indemnification in
respect thereof will be available hereunder) if there would have   58 
63  been a misrepresentation or inaccuracy in such representation or
warranty absent such qualification or limitation. Any written claim for
indemnification made under this section 10(b)(ii) shall be specific as to the
representation, warranty or covenant allegedly breached and shall include
reasonable supporting documentation.   (iii) Sellers will also jointly and
severally indemnify and hold harmless Penton from and against Adverse
Consequences Penton may suffer (A) because of a breach of the representations
and warranties contained in section 4(i), (B) resulting from Sellers\'
operation of the business of DCI, DII or the DCI Subsidiary on or prior to

or the DCI Subsidiary not listed in section 10(b)(i) hereof other than (1)

breach of a representation or warranty of section 4(v)), and (5) all
liabilities of the Companies for transfer, sales, use, and other taxes
arising in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the liabilities described in clauses (1) through (5) being
collectively referred to herein as the Assumed Liabilities); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that Penton may not seek indemnity under both "10(b)(ii) hereof and
this "10(b)(iii) for the same Adverse Consequences if both provisions are
applicable.   59  64   (iv) Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify
Penton from and against any Adverse Consequences under section 10(b)(ii) or
(iii) until Penton has suffered Adverse Consequences under one or both
sections in excess of an aggregate, combined deductible of $1,000,000 (in
which event Sellers will be obligated to indemnify Penton, and Penton may
assert its right to indemnification hereunder only with respect to Adverse
Consequences that are more than $1,000,000). Sellers obligation to indemnify
Penton from and against Adverse Consequences under section 10(b)(ii) is
limited to $25,000,000. Sellers obligation to indemnify Penton from and
against Adverse Consequences under section 10(b)(iii) is limited equal to
$50,000,000. The caps described in the preceding two sentences are separate
and apply independently of each other. Neither the basket nor the caps
described in this section 10(b)(iv) will apply to any claim made by Penton
(1) under section 10 (b)(i), (2) for fraud, (3) based on a misrepresentation
or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties contained in any of
section 3 or section 4(a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (k), (v) or (x), or (4) a
breach of any covenant of Sellers contained in this Agreement.   (c)
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS FOR BENEFIT OF SELLERS.   (i) In the event Penton
breaches any of its representations, warranties, and covenants contained in
this Agreement or in any agreement or certificate delivered at Closing in
accordance with this Agreement, then Penton agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless all Sellers from and against the entirety of any Adverse
Consequences any Seller may suffer as a result of the breach through and
after the date of the claim for indemnification (including any Adverse
Consequences Sellers may suffer after the end of eighteen months with respect
to those representations and warranties whose survival is limited to eighteen
months). Any written claim for indemnification made under this
section 10(c)(i) shall be specific as to the representation, warranty or
covenant allegedly breached and shall include reasonable supporting
documentation.   60  65   (ii) Penton agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers from and against any Adverse Consequences they may suffer by
the failure of Penton to honor any Assumed Liability.   (iii) Penton
further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers from and against
any Adverse Consequence resulting from Penton\'s operation of the business of
DCI, DII or the DCI Subsidiary after the Closing Date.   (d) MATTERS
INVOLVING THIRD PARTIES.   (i) If any third party shall notify any Party
(the Indemnified Party) with respect to any matter (a Third Party Claim)
which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against the other Party
(the Indemnifying Party) under this section 10, then the Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; provided,
however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation
hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party
thereby is prejudiced.   (ii) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to
assume the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at any time within 30 days
after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense of
the Third Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve
its rights in this regard; and provided further that the Indemnified Party
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate
in the defense of the Third Party Claim.   (iii) So long as the Indemnifying
Party has assumed and is conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim in
accordance with section 10(d)(ii) above, (A) the Indemnifying   61 
66  Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably) unless the
judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages by
the Indemnifying Party and does not impose an injunction or other equitable
relief upon the Indemnified Party and (B) the Indemnified Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld unreasonably).   (iv) In the event
the Indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with section 10(d)(ii) above, however, (A) the
Indemnified Party may defend against, and consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim
in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party
need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, any Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith) and (B) the Indemnifying Party will remain
responsible for any Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this section 10.  
(e) ADJUSTMENT TO PURCHASE PRICE. All indemnification payments under
this section 10 shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price.   (f)
DETERMINATION OF ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. The amount of any Adverse Consequence
subject to indemnification hereunder or any claim therefore shall
be calculated net of any insurance proceeds (net of direct collection
expenses and taxes with respect thereto) received or receivable by Penton,
the Companies or a DCI Subsidiary on account of such loss if such proceeds
are payable with respect to a policy, and during a policy period, for which
the   62  67  premiums were paid by the Sellers, the Companies or the DCI
Subsidiary before the Closing Date.   (g) SETOFF. If, after following the
procedures set forth in this section 10, it has been determined that either
party is entitled to an indemnification payment from the other party with
respect to a Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party fails to make such
payment within five business days of such determination, in addition to any
and all other remedies under this Agreement or at law or in equity, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any such indemnification
payment (whether or not such amount is liquidated or reduced to judgment) by
retaining and setting off such amounts against any amounts due or to become
due from the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement, including, without
limitation, any purchase price adjustment pursuant to section 2(f) hereof. If
any claim for indemnification other than with respect to a Third Party Claim
is made and the claim is not settled or the Parties are unable to reach an
agreement for the settlement of the claim within 90 days of the written claim
for indemnification, then the indemnified party will be entitled to
direct payment of any amounts due or to become due from the indemnified party
to the indemnifying party, in an amount not to exceed the amount in
controversy, to an escrow agent to be held by such agent pending the
resolution of the dispute among the Parties. The Parties shall, in such
event, enter into an escrow agreement in substantially the form attached as
Exhibit E to establish the escrow contemplated by this Section.   63 
68   11. MISCELLANEOUS.   (a) EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. No remedy conferred by any
of the specific provisions of this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of
any other remedy and each remedy will be cumulative and will be in addition
to every other remedy given hereunder or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or by statute or otherwise. No remedy will be deemed to be a
limitation on the amount or measure of damages resulting from any breach of
this Agreement. The election of any one or more remedies will not constitute
a waiver of the right to pursue other available remedies. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and except as provided in section 10 hereof, no claim shall be
brought or maintained by Penton or any of the Companies or the DCI Subsidiary
against Duke in his capacity other than as a shareholder of DII or the DCI
Subsidiary or as a limited partner of DCI by virtue of or based upon any
alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants of Sellers set forth in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder.   (b) PRESS RELEASES AND
PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. No Party shall issue any press release or make any
public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement prior to
the Closing without the prior written approval of the other Party; provided,
however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good
faith is required by applicable law or any listing or trading agreement
concerning its publicly-traded securities (in which case the disclosing Party
will use its reasonable best efforts to advise the other Party prior to
making the disclosure).   (c) NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement
shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   64 
69   (d) ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (including the documents referred
to herein) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or
between the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they related in any way
to the subject matter hereof.   (e) SUCCESSION AND ASSIGNMENT. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named
herein and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The rights of
the Sellers to receive the Purchase Price, including the contingent portions
thereof, are freely transferable by the Sellers after prior written notice to
Penton; otherwise, no Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other Party; provided, however, that Penton may (i) assign
any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its
Affiliates and (ii) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its
obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases Penton nonetheless shall
remain responsible for the performance of all of its obligations
hereunder).   (f) COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument.   (g) HEADINGS.
The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.   (h) NOTICES. All notices, requests, demands, claims, and
