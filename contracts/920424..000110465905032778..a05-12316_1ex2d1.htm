thereof (each, a " _Preferred Warrant Holder_ "), in cancellation and
settlement therefor, to a payment in cash (subject to any applicable
withholding taxes), at the Effective Time, equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Series A Preferred Shares as to which that Preferred Warrant

Series A Preferred Liquidation Preference over (y) the exercise price per
Series A Preferred Share subject to such Preferred Warrant (such amounts

this Section 3.4(b). Each vested Common Warrant, either vested pursuant to
its terms or vested by appropriate resolutions of the Company Board (or, if

the extent unexercised as of the Effective Time, shall thereafter no longer
be exercisable but shall entitle each holder thereof (each, a " _Common
Warrant Holder_ ", and together with the Preferred Warrant Holders, the "
_Warrant Holders_ "), in cancellation and settlement therefor, to a payment
in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes), at the Effective Time,

excess, if any, of (x) the Common Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise
price per Class A Common Share subject to such Common Warrant (such amounts
payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Common Warrant Payments_ ", and

and Escrow Fund the aggregate Warrant Payments due pursuant to this Section
3.4.  As soon as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15)
days after the Effective Time, the Payment Agent shall mail to each Warrant
Holder (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the agreement or instrument
evidencing a Warrant (a " _Warrant Agreement_ ") shall pass, only upon proper
delivery by such Warrant Holder of his, her or its Warrant Agreement to the

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

Payment Agent, and shall be in customary form), and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Warrant Agreement in exchange for the
Warrant Payment contemplated to be paid to the Warrant Holder pursuant to
this Section 3.4. Upon surrender of a Warrant Agreement to the Payment Agent,
the Warrant Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Warrant Payment represented by such Warrant Agreement as set forth above,
which Warrant Payment shall be payable upon such proper surrender by the
Payment Agent by delivery of a certified or bank cashiers check or by wire
transfer, less the portion of the Escrow Fund with respect to such Warrant,
which shall be payable in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any cash payable to Warrant Holders.

  

### 

  

## 3.5. _Return of Merger Consideration_. If, after eighteen (18) months
after the Effective Time, there remain any Company Holders who have not
surrendered their Certificates, Option Agreements or Warrant Agreements for
payment of the Merger Consideration, the Payment Agent shall mail notices to
such holders at the address set forth in the records of the Company notifying
them of their right to receive the Closing Merger Consideration and
participate in the Escrow Fund. To the extent that any Company Holders have
not tendered their Certificates, Option Agreements or Warrant Agreements
within ninety (90) days after the mailing of such notice, the Payment Agent
shall return, to the extent permitted by law, to Parent any funds held by it
for the benefit of Company Holders and deliver to Parent any Certificates or
other documents received by it from any Company Holder after such time. Upon
receipt, Parent shall hold the remaining funds for the benefit of such
holders and shall deliver to any Company Holder who has properly surrendered

otherwise escheat to or become the property of any public official, any such
Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

consented thereto in writing or otherwise contractually waived their rights
to appraisal and who have complied with all of the relevant provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless and until such Dissenting Stockholders shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to

any written demands for appraisal of any Company Shares,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served

Stockholders rights of appraisal, and (b) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the

Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, then (i) as of the occurrence of such

pursuant to Section 3.11 hereof); and (ii) the shares of common stock of
Liquidnet Holdings, Inc. held of record by the Company and any registration
or other rights associated therewith. In the event such distributions have

### 

  

#### (i) Parent shall cause to be prepared a consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, together with
calculations of the Working Capital as of the Closing Date (collectively, the
" _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), all of which shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the Audited December 31 Balance
Sheet. Parent shall deliver the Closing Balance Sheet to Representative
within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date.

  



  

19   

     
   

  



  

#### (ii) If within forty-five (45) days following delivery of the Closing
Balance Sheet, Representative has not given Parent written notice of its
objection as to any amounts set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet (which
notice shall state the basis of Representatives objection in reasonable
detail), then the Closing Balance Sheet shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) If Representative duly gives Parent such notice of objection
within the forty-five (45) day period, and if the Representative and Parent
fail to resolve the issues outstanding (after good faith discussions) with
respect to the Closing Balance Sheet within thirty (30) days of the Parents
receipt of Representatives objection notice, the Representative and Parent
shall submit the issues remaining in dispute to Deloitte and Touche, LLP,
independent public accountants, or such other accountants as mutually agreed
by Parent and Representative (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") for
resolution. If issues are submitted to the Independent Accountants for
resolution, then:

  

#### 

  

(A) the Representative and Parent shall execute any agreement(s) required by
the Independent Accountants to accept their engagement;

  



  

(B) the Representative and Parent shall promptly furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Independent Accountants such work papers and other documents
and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent
Accountants may request and are available to that party or its accountants or
other agents, and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Independent Accountants, with a copy to the other party, any written material
relating to the disputed issues;

  



  

(C) the determination by the Independent Accountants, as set forth in a
written notice to be delivered by the Independent Accountants to both the
Representative and Parent, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties and shall be used by Parent to prepare the final Closing Balance
Sheet, which shall become binding on the parties as of the date of the
determination notice sent by the Independent Accountants; and

  



  

(D) the fees and costs of the Independent Accountants for such determination
shall be borne 50% from Parent and 50% out of the Escrow Fund; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the engagement agreement(s) referred to in subpart (A) above
may require the parties to be bound jointly and severally to the
Independent Accountants for those fees and costs, and in the event the Escrow
Agent or Parent pays to the Independent Accountants any amount in excess of
50% of the fees and costs of their engagement, the other party(ies) agree(s)
to reimburse the Escrow Agent or Parent, as applicable, to the extent
required to equalize the payments made by the Escrow Agent and Parent with
respect to the fees and costs of the Independent Accountants.

  



  

### (b) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be decreased or increased, as the case may be, by the amount that the Working
Capital of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, as finally
determined in accordance with Sections 3.11(a), is less than or greater than,
as the case may be, the Target Amount (such difference referred to as the "
_Working Capital Adjustment_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the Working
Capital of the Company shall not include any accruals or liabilities for
Transaction

  



  

20   

     
   

  



  

Expenses, except for the amount of Transaction Expenses, if any, in excess of
Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). If the Working Capital Adjustment
constitutes a decrease in the Merger Consideration, then the amount of the
Working Capital Adjustment shall be paid to Parent out of the Escrow Fund
(and the Representative and Parent shall promptly deliver a joint instruction
letter to the Escrow Agent authorizing the release of such amount from the
Escrow Fund). If the Working Capital Adjustment constitutes an increase in
the Merger Consideration, then Parent shall deposit the amount of the Working
Capital Adjustment with the Payment Agent for distribution to the Company
Holders in accordance with the Payment Agent Agreement. Any payment under
this Section 3.11(b) shall be made within fifteen (15) business days after
the Closing Balance Sheet is finalized in accordance with Section 3.11(a).

except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All premiums with respect to such insurance policies have been paid

action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing consents, approvals
and authorizations of Governmental Authorities and having theretofore used

Parent or the Company (unless, in the case of the Company, Parent agrees
thereto) to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or

greater extent as is provided under the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation and by-laws as of the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation will amend, repeal or modify such provisions in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such persons;
_provided_ ,  _that_ , such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law. In addition, as of

coverage for any current or former officers or directors of the Company or
any Subsidiary under the Companys or Parents directors and officers
liability insurance policy with respect to any actions or omissions by such

applicable policy in effect on the date hereof; provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount no
less favorable in the aggregate than those of the Companys applicable policy
in effect on the date hereof, and which policies may include a "tail policy";

expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums

## 6.8. _Employee Benefits_. For purposes of determining

benefit plans, the " _Purchaser Benefit Plans_ "), except to the extent
excluded from coverage under the comparable employee Plan maintained on or
after the Closing Date (each a " _Continued Employee Plan_ "), Parent shall
for purposes of determining whether the Continuing Employee has met the
eligibility service requirements of a Purchaser Benefit Plan and upon each
applicable Continuing Employees commencement of participation in an
applicable Purchaser Benefit Plan for purposes of vesting and, to the extent
applicable, for purposes of benefit accrual, credit each Continuing Employee
with his or her years of service with the Company, its Subsidiaries that are
ERISA Affiliates, and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such
Continuing Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any similar
Continued Employee Plan prior to the Continuing Employees commencement of
participation in the Purchaser Benefit Plan, except that Continuing Employees
shall receive no such credit (i) to the extent that such credit would result
in a duplication of benefits or (ii) under any newly-established Parent
Benefit Plan for which similarly-situated employees of Parent do not receive
credited service. The Purchaser Benefit Plans that are "group health plans"
(within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code), to the extent it is
lawful and commercially reasonable, shall not deny Continuing Employees
coverage under the Purchaser Benefit Plans that are "group health plans"
(within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) on the basis of pre-
existing conditions and shall credit such Continuing Employees (and
their dependents) for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid under
the applicable Continued Employee Plans in the year of initial participation
in the applicable Purchaser Benefit Plans that are group health plans (within
the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) except to the extent a
Continuing Employee (or dependent) was excluded from coverage under the
applicable Continued Employee Plans. Any Purchaser Benefit Plan that by its
terms, whether specifically or by interpretation, excludes a Continuing
Employee from participation in such Purchaser Benefit Plan (other than any
such plans with respect to which new participation has been frozen for Parent
employees generally) shall be amended to provide that Continuing Employees
shall participate in any such plan to the same extent as similarly situated
employees of Parent (except as my be prohibited by applicable Law), and no
Continuing Employee shall be denied credit for service performed for the
Company, its Subsidiaries that are ERISA Affiliates, and any predecessor
entities under Purchaser Benefit Plans to the extent consistent with the
other provisions of this Section 6.8, if it is contrary to applicable Law.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ERISA Affiliate_ " shall include
any organization that is or has ever been treated as a single employer with
the Company or any Subsidiary under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code or Section 4001(b) of ERISA. The Surviving Corporation shall satisfy
and be fully responsible for any and all COBRA obligations that arise with

exhibits, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Related Agreements and all other
ancillary agreements, documents and instruments to be delivered in connection
herewith, contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, either oral or
written. Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that no representations,
inducements, promises or agreements, orally or otherwise, have been made by
any other party, or by anyone acting on behalf of any party, that are not
embodied herein, and that no other agreement, statement, or promise not
contained in this Agreement shall be valid or binding.

  

## 

  

## 11.2. _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended only by
an instrument in writing signed by duly authorized representatives of
Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company and the Representative. At any time
prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts required hereunder, waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party or parties to be bound thereby.

  

## 

  

## 11.3. _Assignment_. No party hereto shall assign or otherwise transfer
this Agreement or any of its rights hereunder, or delegate any of

parties hereto. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and the rights and
obligations set forth herein shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding
upon the parties hereto, and each of their respective successors, heirs and
permitted assigns.

  

## 

  

## 11.4. _Waivers_. No waiver by any party, whether express or implied, of
its rights under any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of
the partys rights under such provisions at any other time or a waiver of the
partys rights under any other provision of this Agreement. No failure by any
party to take any action against any breach of this Agreement or

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

## default by another party shall constitute a waiver of the former partys
right to enforce any provision of this Agreement or to take action against
such breach or default or any subsequent breach or default by the other
party. To be effective any waiver must be in writing and signed by the
waiving party.

  

## 

  

## 11.5. _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This Agreement shall
be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, except
for matters within the scope of the DGCL, which shall be governed thereby,

Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably submits to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
Each of the parties to this Agreement consents to service of process by
delivery pursuant to Section 10.9 hereof and agrees that a final judgment in
any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.  Each of the

related to or arising out of this Agreement or Related Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby.

hereto shall be cumulative. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are unique transactions and any failure on the part of any party to complete
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms of
this Agreement will not be fully compensable in damages and the breach or
threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement would cause the other
parties hereto irreparable harm. Accordingly, in addition to and not in
limitation of any other remedies available to the parties hereto for a breach
or threatened breach of this Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to seek
specific performance of this Agreement and seek an injunction restraining any
such party from such breach or threatened breach.
