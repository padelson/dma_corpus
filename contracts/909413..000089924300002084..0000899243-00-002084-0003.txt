     in Section 1.10(a)) to the extent Seller does not obtain the consents and
     waivers necessary to assign, transfer or sublicense such Deferred Items to

     pursuant to Section 1.10(a) hereof and (ii) Seller Deferred Items (as
     defined in Section 1.10(b)).

          1.7. Consideration. Regardless of whether the transfer of any Assets
or Subsidiary Interests has been deferred pursuant to the provisions of Section
1.10 or any analogous provision of any related agreement, in consideration for
the sale and transfer of the Assets and the Subsidiary Interests, and subject to

five million dollars ($95,000,000) in cash to Seller (the "Cash Purchase Price")

recent thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date on which the New York Stock
Exchange is open and available for at least five (5) hours for the trading of
securities.

          1.9. Purchase Price Allocation. Seller shall prepare a schedule which
will set forth an allocation of the Purchase Price to each of the Subsidiary
Interests and the aggregate amount of the Assets which will be transferred
pursuant to this Agreement, and Seller and Buyer shall then cooperate in good
faith to revise such schedule to reflect each other's comments on or prior to
the Closing. If the parties are unable to agree upon an allocation prior to the
Closing, the parties shall continue to cooperate in the preparation of, and use
their reasonable best efforts to agree upon, the allocation, provided that any
material issues with respect to the allocation which have not been finally
resolved within 30 days following the Closing shall be referred for resolution
to Ernst & Young LLP or another internationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants as to which Seller and Buyer mutually agree (the "CPA Firm"),
whose determination shall be final and binding upon the parties. The costs of
such CPA Firm shall be shared equally by the parties. As soon as practicable
following the Closing, but in no event later than 90 days prior to the date on
which Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and, if applicable, Form 8023 (or any
similar forms required by any foreign jurisdiction) is due, Buyer will prepare
an allocation schedule (the "Allocation Schedule") of the Purchase Price and
Assumed Liabilities among the Assets (including classes of assets) and
Subsidiary Interests along with the first draft of Internal Revenue Service Form
8594 and, if applicable, Form 8023 (and any similar forms required by any
foreign jurisdiction). Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such
Allocation Schedule and Form 8594 and, if applicable, Form 8023 (and similar
forms), Seller shall propose any changes to such Allocation Schedule and Form
8594 and, if applicable, Form 8023 (and similar forms) or shall be deemed to be
in concurrence therewith, which concurrence shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be reflected in the
Allocation Schedule in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code or, if
applicable, Section 338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and Buyer shall
deliver any changes to the Allocation Schedule to Seller within twenty (20) days
after such changes are made. Seller and Buyer shall endeavor in good faith to
resolve any differences with respect to the Allocation Schedule and Form 8594
and, if applicable, Form 8023 (and similar forms). Seller and Buyer agree to act
in accordance with the computations and allocations contained in the Allocation
Schedule, after giving effect to the foregoing procedures, in any relevant Tax
Returns or filings (including, but not limited to, any forms or reports required
to be filed pursuant to Section 1060

                                       15
<PAGE>

of the Code and, if applicable, Section 338 of the Code, the Treasury
Regulations or any provisions of local, state and foreign law) and shall not
take any position contrary thereto unless required to do so pursuant to a
determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), and shall cooperate in the
preparation of any such forms or reports and to file such forms or reports in
the manner required by applicable law.

          1.10. Deferred Transfers. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery to Buyer of any Asset or Subsidiary Interest is
prohibited by any applicable federal, national, state, provincial, municipal,
foreign or local law, statute, ordinance, act, rule, regulation, governmental
requirement, directive, decision, order, judgment or decree of any kind in any
country ("Law") or would require any governmental or third-party authorizations,
approvals, consents or waivers (each, an "Approval") and such Approvals shall
not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute
a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or any attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof. Following the Closing,
Seller shall use its, and shall cause the Subsidiary Asset Sellers to use their,
reasonable efforts to obtain promptly such Approvals; provided, however, that no
Asset Seller shall be required to pay any consideration therefor, other than
filing, recordation or similar fees payable to any domestic or foreign
government or governmental authority. Pending such Approval, (i) the parties
shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable and lawful arrangements
designed to provide to Buyer the benefits of such Asset or Subsidiary Interest
not sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered at the Closing (each, a
"Deferred Item") and (ii) Seller shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary
Asset Seller to, enforce, at the reasonable request of Buyer for the account of
Buyer, any rights of the applicable Asset Seller arising from such Deferred
Item. Once such Approval for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery of a Deferred Item is obtained, Seller shall, or shall cause the
applicable Subsidiary Asset Seller to, promptly assign, transfer, convey and
deliver, or cause to be assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered, such
Deferred Item to Buyer for no additional consideration. To the extent that any
such Deferred Item cannot be transferred or the full benefits and liabilities of
use of any such Deferred Item cannot be provided to Buyer following the Closing
pursuant to this Section 1.10(a), then Buyer and Seller shall enter into such
arrangements (including subleasing or contracting if permitted) to provide to
Buyer the economic (taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational
equivalent of obtaining such Approval and the performance by Buyer of the
obligations thereunder. Nothing in this Section 1.10(a) shall affect Buyer's
rights pursuant to Sections 5.7 and 7.1(b) hereof or its rights to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof.

          (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
     Agreement, to the extent that the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
     delivery or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to
     Seller of any Excluded Assets on the books of any Transferred Subsidiary
     (including, without limitation, the Contract For the Purchase of Gas
     Compressors and Gas Compression Services between Corpoven, S.A. and
     Southwest Industries, Inc., Venezuelan Branch, dated June 1995) or the
     assumption by Seller of any Excluded Liabilities on the books of any
     Transferred Subsidiary is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require
     any Approval and such Approvals shall not have been obtained prior to the
     Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer,
     conveyance, delivery or assumption, or any attempted sale, assignment,
     transfer, conveyance, delivery or assumption,

                                       16
<PAGE>

     thereof. Following the Closing, Buyer and Hanover shall use their, and
     shall cause their subsidiaries to use their, reasonable efforts to obtain
     promptly such Approvals; provided, however, that none of Hanover or any of
     its subsidiaries shall be required to pay any consideration therefor, other
     than filing, recordation or similar fees payable to any domestic or foreign
     government or governmental authority. Pending such Approval, (i) the
     parties shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable and lawful
     arrangements designed to allocate to Seller the benefits and burdens of
     such asset or liability not sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or
     delivered prior to the Closing (each, a "Seller Deferred Item") and (ii)
     Buyer and Hanover shall, or shall cause their subsidiaries to, enforce, at
     the reasonable request of Seller for the account of Seller, any rights of
     Hanover and its subsidiaries arising from such Seller Deferred Item. Once
     such Approval for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, delivery or
     assumption of a Seller Deferred Item is obtained, Hanover and Buyer shall,
     or shall cause their applicable subsidiary to, promptly assign, transfer,
     convey and deliver, or cause to be assigned, transferred, conveyed and
     delivered, such Seller Deferred Item to Seller for no consideration and
     Seller shall, or shall cause one of its subsidiaries to, effect the
     assumption of any Seller Deferred Items constituting an obligation. To the
     extent that any such Seller Deferred Item cannot be transferred or the full
     benefits and liabilities of use of any such Seller Deferred Item cannot be
     provided to Seller following the Closing pursuant to this Section 1.10(b),
     then Buyer and Seller shall enter into such arrangements (including
     subleasing or contracting if permitted) to provide to Seller the economic
     (taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent of
     obtaining such Approval and the performance by Seller of the obligations
     thereunder. Nothing in this Section 1.10(b) shall affect Buyer's or
     Seller's rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof.

          1.11. Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) Within seventy-five (75) days
after the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, on behalf of Seller, will
prepare, or cause to be prepared, a statement of net assets (the "Closing
Statement") containing a calculation of the net assets of the Compression
Services Business as of the Closing Date (the "Net Assets Amount"). For the
purposes of the calculation referred to in the immediately preceding sentence,
the net assets of the Compression Services Business shall include, among other
things, cash and marketable securities in the Transferred Subsidiaries, but
shall not include amounts due to and from Seller and its affiliates other than
as a result of trade receivables and trade payables. Buyer will assist and
cooperate with Seller in the preparation of the Closing Statement, including by
providing Seller and its accountants access to the books and records relating to
the Compression Services Business and to any other information necessary to
prepare the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in
conformity with GAAP (as defined in Section 2.5), applied on a basis consistent
with the 1999 Statement of Net Assets (as defined in Section 2.5).

          (b) Buyer shall, within forty-five (45) days after the delivery by
     Seller of the Closing Statement and calculation of the Net Assets Amount,
     complete its review of the Closing Statement and the calculation of such
     Net Assets Amount. In the event that Buyer determines that the Net Assets
     Amount has not been determined on a basis consistent with the requirements
     of Section 1.11(a), Buyer shall inform Seller in writing (the "Objection"),
     setting forth a specific description of the basis of the Objection, the
     adjustments to the Net Assets Amount which Buyer believes should be made,
     and Buyer's calculation of the Net Assets Amount on or before the last day
     of such 45-day period and Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted any items
     not disputed in the Objection. Failure to so notify Seller shall constitute
     acceptance and approval of Seller's

                                       17
<PAGE>

     calculation of the Net Assets Amount. Seller shall then have 30 days from
     the date it receives the Objection to review and respond to the Objection.
     If the Net Assets Amount calculated by Buyer and the Net Assets Amount
     calculated by Seller are both less than sixty-nine million eight hundred
     eighty-three thousand dollars ($69,883,000) (the "Base Amount"), Seller
     shall pay an amount equal to the sum of (x) the amount of the deficiency
     between the Base Amount and the Net Assets Amount calculated by Seller plus
     (y) interest computed at the rate declared from time to time by The Chase
     Manhattan Bank as its "prime rate" (the "Prime Rate") for the period from
     the Closing Date to the date of such payment on the deficiency amount, in
     immediately available funds or, at the option of Seller, by paying 50% of
     such deficiency amount in immediately available funds and 50% of such
     deficiency amount by delivering shares of Hanover Stock to Buyer with an
     aggregate value (based on the value used in the determination of the Stock
     Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.7) equal to 50% of such deficiency
     amount within 3 business days of Seller's receipt of Buyer's Objection. If
     the Net Assets Amount calculated by Buyer and the Net Assets Amount
     calculated by Seller are both greater than the Base Amount, Buyer shall pay
     an amount equal to the sum of (1) the amount of the excess of the Net
     Assets Amount calculated by Buyer over the Base Amount plus (2) interest
     computed at the Prime Rate for the period from the Closing Date to the date
     of such payment on the excess amount, in immediately available funds to
     Seller within 3 business days of Seller's receipt of Buyer's Objection.
     Seller shall then have 30 days from the date it receives the Objection to
     review and respond to the Objection. If Seller and Buyer are unable to
     resolve all of their disagreements with respect to the determination of the
     foregoing items within 30 days following the completion of Seller's review
     of the Objection, after having used their good faith efforts to reach a
     resolution, they shall refer their remaining differences to the CPA Firm,
     who shall, acting as experts in accounting and not as arbitrators,
     determine on a basis consistent with the requirements of Section 1.11(a),
     and only with respect to the specific remaining accounting related
     differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the Net
     Assets Amount requires adjustment. Seller and Buyer shall request the CPA
     Firm to use its best efforts to render its determination within 45 days.
     The CPA Firm's determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Seller
     and Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall make reasonably available to the CPA Firm
     all relevant books and records, any work papers (including those of the
     parties' respective accountants) and supporting documentation relating to
     the Closing Statement, the calculation of the Net Assets Amount and all
     other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm. The applicable Net Assets
     Amount (the "Final Net Assets Amount") shall ultimately be equal to (i) the
     Net Assets Amount in the event that (x) no Objection is delivered to Seller
     during the 45-day period specified above, or (y) Seller and Buyer so agree,
     (ii) the applicable Net Assets Amount, adjusted in accordance with the
     Objection in the event that Seller does not respond to the Objection within
     the 30-day period following receipt by Seller of the Objection, or (iii)
     the applicable Net Assets Amount, as adjusted by either (x) the agreement
     of Seller and Buyer or (y) the CPA Firm. All fees and disbursements of the
     CPA Firm, if any, shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer.

          (c) If the Final Net Assets Amount is less than the Base Amount,
     Seller shall pay an amount equal to the difference of (x) the amount of
     such deficiency minus (y) any amounts paid by Seller to Buyer pursuant to
     Section 1.11(b)(x) (such difference, the "Remaining Deficiency Amount"),
     plus (z) interest computed at the Prime Rate for the period from the
     Closing Date to the date of such payment on the Remaining Deficiency
     Amount, in immediately available funds or, at the option of Seller, by
     paying 50% of such Remaining Deficiency Amount

                                       18
<PAGE>

     in immediately available funds and 50% of such Remaining Deficiency Amount
     by delivering shares of Hanover Stock to Buyer with an aggregate value
     (based on the value used in the determination of the Stock Purchase Price
     pursuant to Section 1.7) equal to such 50% of the Remaining Deficiency
     Amount within 3 business days after the ultimate determination of the Final
     Net Assets Amount as provided in this Section 1.11. If the Final Net Assets
     Amount is greater than the Base Amount, Buyer shall pay an amount equal to
     the difference of (1) the amount of such excess minus (2) any amounts paid
     by Buyer to Seller pursuant to Section 1.11(b)(1) (such difference, the
     "Remaining Excess Amount"), plus (3) interest computed at the Prime Rate
     for the period from the Closing Date to the date of such payment on the
     Remaining Excess Amount, in immediately available funds to Seller within 3
     business days after the ultimate determination of the Final Net Assets
     Amount as provided in this Section 1.11.

          (rr) Any amount paid pursuant to this Section 1.11 shall be deemed to
     be an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

          1.12. Further Assurances. After the Closing, each party hereto shall
from time to time, at the request of another party, execute and deliver such
other instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such other actions as such
other party may reasonably request in order to more effectively consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by Section 1.10) and to vest in Buyer good and valid
title to the Subsidiary Interests and the Assets.

                                  ARTICLE II

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

          Seller, on behalf of itself and the Subsidiaries, including, without
limitation, the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Asset Sellers, hereby
represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

          2.1. Organization. Seller is a general partnership duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of New York.
Seller has all requisite partnership power and authority to own its assets and
to carry on the Compression Services Business as now being conducted by it and
is duly qualified or licensed to conduct the Compression Services Business and
is in good standing in the jurisdictions in which the ownership of its property
or the conduct of the Compression Services Business requires such qualification
or license, except jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or
licensed would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations, assets, financial condition or business of
the Compression Services Business taken as a whole (hereinafter referred to as a
"Material Adverse Effect"). Except as set forth in Section 2.1 of the Disclosure
Schedule, with respect to the Compression Services Business, Seller does not own
or have any option or right to acquire, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock or other equity securities of, or have any direct or indirect equity or
ownership interest or debt investment in, any corporation, association,
partnership, joint venture or other business.

                                       19
<PAGE>

          2.2. Subsidiaries. Section 2.2 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
for each Subsidiary (i) its structure (i.e., corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, etc.), name and jurisdiction of incorporation, formation or
organization, as applicable, and (ii) the number of issued and outstanding
shares of each class of its capital stock or other issued and outstanding equity
interests, as applicable, the names of the holders thereof, and the number of
shares or percentage interests, as applicable, held by each such holder. Each
Subsidiary is duly formed or organized, validly existing and, where applicable,
in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, formation
or organization, as applicable, has the requisite corporate or similar power and
authority to own its assets and to carry on the Compression Services Business as
now being conducted by it, and where applicable, is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing in the jurisdictions in which the
ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification or license, except jurisdictions in which the failure to be so
qualified or licensed would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. All the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of the Transferred Subsidiaries are duly authorized and validly
issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable (where applicable) and
owned by the persons set forth in Section 2.2 of the Disclosure Schedule. Except
as set forth in Section 2.2 of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no options,
warrants, calls, commitments, agreements, contracts, understandings,
restrictions, arrangements or rights of any character with respect to the
securities of the Transferred Subsidiaries or the issuance of additional
securities of the Subsidiaries. Complete and correct copies of the charter
documents (or equivalent organizational documents) and all amendments thereto
and the minute books of each of the Transferred Subsidiaries have been made
available to Buyer on or prior to the date of this Agreement.

          2.3. Ownership of Interests. Good title to the Subsidiary Interests is
owned of record and beneficially solely by Seller or a Subsidiary, free and
clear of all Encumbrances, other than certain nominee shares (the "Nominee
Shares"), as to which Seller and the Subsidiaries have the requisite contractual
authority to convey good title to Buyer as set forth in Section 2.2 of the
Disclosure Schedule, and other than as otherwise set forth in Section 2.2 of the
Disclosure Schedule. Subject only to recording on the books of the respective
Transferred Subsidiaries (for which there is no material impediment), the
transfer of the Subsidiary Interests to Buyer at Closing will vest in Buyer good
title to the Subsidiary Interests, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except
for any Encumbrances resulting from any action taken by or on behalf of Buyer or
as otherwise set forth in Section 2.2 of the Disclosure Schedule.

          2.4. Authorization, Etc. Seller has full partnership power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to carry out the
transactions contemplated hereby to be carried out by it, and Seller and each
Subsidiary has full power and authority to execute and deliver any other
agreements or instruments contemplated hereby (to the extent such entity is a
party thereto) and to carry out the transactions contemplated thereby to be
carried out by it. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed by Seller
and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement
of Buyer, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of Seller,
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects
of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general
equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)
and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. When executed and
delivered as provided in this Agreement, each other agreement and

                                       20
<PAGE>

instrument contemplated hereby to be executed by Seller or any Subsidiary will
be a valid and legally binding obligation of Seller or such Subsidiary (to the
extent a party thereto) enforceable against Seller or such Subsidiary in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

          2.5. Financial Statements. Seller has made available to Buyer the
unaudited pro forma Statement of Net Assets of the Compression Services Business
at December 31, 1999 (the "1999 Statement of Net Assets") and the related
unaudited pro forma statement of income for the twelve-month period then ended.
Except as set forth in Section 2.5 of the Disclosure Schedule, all the foregoing
financial statements have been prepared from the books and records of Seller and
its affiliates in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America ("GAAP"), as in effect during the period indicated.
Except as set forth in Section 2.5 of the Disclosure Schedule, the foregoing
income statement presents fairly in all material respects the unaudited pro
forma results of operations of the Compression Services Business for the period
covered, and the 1999 Statement of Net Assets presents fairly in all material
respects the unaudited pro forma financial condition of the Compression Services
Business as of the date thereof, in each case in conformity with GAAP (except as
stated above).

          2.6. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. There are no liabilities of
any kind whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, and
whether due or to become due) that are required to be reflected in, or disclosed
in the notes to, an unaudited pro forma Statement of Net Assets of the
Compression Services Business prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than
liabilities and obligations (i) reflected in the 1999 Statement of Net Assets
(or disclosed in the notes thereto), (ii) arising after December 31, 1999, in
the Ordinary Course of Business or (iii) disclosed in Section 2.6 of the
Disclosure Schedule.

          2.7. No Approvals or Conflicts. Except as set forth in Section 2.7 of
the Disclosure Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance by Seller of
this Agreement and the consummation by Seller and the Subsidiaries of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not (i) violate, conflict with or result
in a breach by Seller or any Subsidiary of any provision of the organizational
documents or the charter (or equivalent) document of Seller or any Subsidiary,
(ii) violate, conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of, or
constitute a default by Seller or any Subsidiary (or create an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default) or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration under, or result in
the creation of any lien, security interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of
the properties of any Seller or any Subsidiary included in the Assets or the
Compression Services Business or on the Subsidiary Interests under, any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit, lease,
contract, agreement or other instrument to which Seller, any Transferred
Subsidiary or any of their respective properties may be bound, (iii) violate or
result in a breach of any order, injunction, judgment, ruling, law or regulation
of any court or governmental authority applicable to Seller, any Subsidiary or
any of their respective properties or (iv) except for applicable requirements of
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), and as otherwise set forth in Section 2.7 of the Disclosure Schedule,
require any order, consent, approval or authorization of, or notice to, or
declaration,

regulatory authority, except, with respect to the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii)
and (iv) above as they apply to matters that are not, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the conduct of the Compression Services Business, as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Seller or the Subsidiaries to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          2.8. Compliance with Law; Governmental Authorizations. Except as set
forth in Section 2.8 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Compression Services
Business is not in violation in any material respect of any order, injunction,
judgment, ruling, law or regulation of any court or governmental authority
applicable to the Assets or the Compression Services Business. Seller and the
Subsidiaries have all licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations
necessary to conduct the Compression Services Business as currently conducted
(all of which are valid and in full force and effect), except where the failure
to have such licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          2.9. Litigation. Except as set forth in Section 2.9 of the Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date hereof, there are no suits, actions, proceedings or
investigations pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller
or any of the Subsidiaries relating to the Compression Services Business or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement before any arbitrator, court or
governmental or regulatory authority or body, which, if decided unfavorably to
Seller or such Subsidiary, would have a Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse effect on the ability of Seller or such Subsidiary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 2.9
of the Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor, to the knowledge of Seller, any
other Asset Seller has received any notice that Seller or any of the other Asset
Sellers or any of the Assets is subject to any decree, order or judgment which
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse effect on the ability of Seller or such other Asset Seller to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth on Schedule
2.9 of the Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of Seller, as of the date
hereof, no Asset Seller is a plaintiff in any suit, action or proceeding. For
the purposes of this Agreement, references to the "Seller's knowledge" or the
"knowledge" of Seller or words of similar import shall mean actual knowledge
after reasonable inquiry of Sammy D. Antoun, Greg Brasel, James Coffman, Barry
Cottrell, Thomas D. Gamble, Brian Gallagher, Steven Muck and David Norton.

          2.10. Personal Property Assets. Except as set forth in Section 2.10 of
the Disclosure Schedule, on December 31, 1999, the Asset Sellers and the
Transferred Subsidiaries had and, except with respect to personal property
assets disposed of or acquired in the Ordinary Course of Business since such
date, the Asset Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries now have, good and
valid title to, or hold by valid and existing lease or license, all the personal
property assets reflected as assets of the Compression Services Business on the
1999 Statement of Net Assets or which would have been reflected on the 1999
Statement of Net Assets if acquired prior to such date, free and clear of all
Encumbrances of any nature except for: (i) Encumbrances which secure
indebtedness or obligations which are properly reflected on the 1999 Statement
of Net Assets; (ii) liens for Taxes not yet payable or being contested in good
faith; (iii) liens arising as a matter of law in the Ordinary Course of
Business, provided that the obligations secured by

                                       22
<PAGE>

such liens are not delinquent or are being contested in good faith; and (iv)
such imperfections of title and Encumbrances which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect (clauses (i) through (iv),
collectively, "Permitted Encumbrances").  Except as set forth in Section 2.10 of
the Disclosure Schedule, the Asset Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries
own, or have valid leasehold interests in, all material tangible personal
property assets necessary for the operation or conduct of the Compression
Services Business as currently conducted and all such assets are in reasonably
good maintenance, operating condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted,
other than machinery and equipment under repair or out of service in the
Ordinary Course of Business.

employees identified as "Additional Employees" on Section 2.13(a) of the

     be expected to affect such qualification.

     where the failure to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect. To
     the knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred with respect to any
     registered Foreign Business Group Plan which would result in the revocation
     of the registration of such Foreign Business Group Plan, or which would
     entitle any person (without the consent of the sponsor of such Foreign
     Business Group Plan) to wind up or terminate any such Foreign Business
     Group Plan, in whole or in part, or could otherwise reasonably be expected
     to have a Material Adverse Effect on the tax status of any such Foreign

valid and binding agreement of Seller, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
agreement of each of Hanover and Buyer, enforceable against each of Hanover and
Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

          3.3. No Approvals or Conflicts. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of Hanover and Buyer of this Agreement and any other
agreements contemplated hereby to be entered into by either Hanover or Buyer,
the consummation by each of Hanover and Buyer of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and the issuance of Hanover Stock by Hanover will not (i)
violate, conflict with or result in a breach by either Hanover or Buyer of any
provision of the certificates of incorporation or by-laws of either Hanover or
Buyer, (ii) violate, conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of, or
constitute a default by either Hanover or Buyer (or create an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration under, or result in the
creation of any lien, security interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of
Hanover's or Buyer's properties under, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed
of trust, license, franchise, permit, lease, contract, agreement or other
instrument to which Hanover, Buyer or any of their respective properties may be
bound, (iii) violate or result in a breach of any order, injunction, judgment,
ruling, law or regulation of any court or governmental authority applicable to

of the Disclosure Schedule, require any order, consent, approval or
authorization of, or notice to, or declaration, filing, application,
qualification or registration with, any governmental or regulatory authority,
except, with respect to the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above as they
apply to matters that are not material to the conduct of the business of Hanover
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the ability
of either Hanover or Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

          3.4. Hanover SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Absence of Certain
Changes. (a) Hanover and, to the extent applicable, each of its then

complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated

None of such Hanover SEC Reports (including but not limited to any financial
statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein)
contained, when filed, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent
revised or superseded by a subsequent filing with the SEC (a copy of which has
been provided or made available to Seller prior to the date hereof), none of the
Hanover SEC Reports filed by Hanover since July 1, 1997 and prior to the date
hereof, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (b) Each of the audited and unaudited financial statements of
     Hanover (including any related notes thereto) included in the Hanover SEC
     Reports, complies or, if not yet filed, will comply as to form in all

     published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; has been

     Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) applied on a consistent basis throughout
     the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
     fairly presents or, if not yet filed, will fairly present the consolidated
     financial position of Hanover at the respective date thereof and the
     consolidated results of its operations and changes in cash flows for the
     periods indicated (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
     to normal year-end audit adjustments).

          (c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated
     balance sheet of Hanover at December 31, 1999, including the notes thereto,
     included in Hanover's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
     December 31, 1999, or on the consolidated balance sheet of Hanover at March
     31, 2000, including the notes thereto, included in Hanover's Quarterly
     Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2000, Hanover
     and its subsidiaries have no liabilities or obligations of any nature
     (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which would be
     required to be reflected on a balance sheet or in the notes thereto
     prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities or obligations
     incurred in the ordinary course of business since March 31, 2000, which
     would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected
     to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the
     ability of Hanover or Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement.

     no representations or warranties, express or implied, at common law, by
     statute or otherwise, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement,
     and Seller, on behalf of itself and its affiliates, hereby disclaims all
     implied warranties, including warranties of merchantability or fitness for
     a particular purpose.

          6.3. Filings and Consents. Each of Seller and the Subsidiaries on the
one hand, and each of Buyer and Hanover on the other hand, shall use all
reasonable efforts to obtain and to cooperate in obtaining any consent,
approval, authorization or order of, and in making any registration or filing
with, any governmental agency or body or other third party required in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement. The
parties agree to cause to be made all appropriate filings under the HSR Act
within five business days of the date of this Agreement and to diligently pursue
termination of the waiting period under such act. The parties agree to take any
and all reasonable steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that is
asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the purchase of the
Compression Services Business so as to enable such purchase to occur as
expeditiously as possible.

          6.4. Tax Matters; Cooperation; Preparation of Returns; Tax Elections.
(a) Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating to the Asset Sellers and the

                                       42
<PAGE>

Transferred Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, access to books and
records, employees, contractors and representatives) as is reasonably necessary
for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes,
the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return. Buyer and
Seller shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to
the Asset Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries until the expiration of all
relevant statutes of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Seller or
Buyer, any extensions thereof). At the end of such period, each party shall
provide the other with at least ten days prior written notice before destroying
any such books and records, during which period the party receiving such notice
can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books and records.

          (b) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns
     in respect of each Transferred Subsidiary (other than a Transferred
     Subsidiary that is a member of an affiliated group that files a United
     States federal consolidated Tax Return or any group that files a combined,
     consolidated, or unitary foreign, state or local Tax Return) for any Pre-
     Closing or Straddle Tax Periods which must be filed after the Closing Date
     in accordance with past practice and custom unless a contrary position is
     required by law. Buyer shall provide Seller 30 days prior to the due date
     of filing such Tax Returns for review and comment and Buyer shall
     incorporate all such reasonable comments into the Tax Return. Buyer shall
     timely pay to the relevant Taxing Authority all Taxes due in connection
     with any such Tax Return and Seller shall reimburse Buyer in accordance
     with procedures provided in Section 6.5(d). For any taxable period of the
     Transferred Subsidiaries that ends on or before the Closing Date, Seller
     and its affiliates shall timely prepare, consistent with past practice and
     custom to the extent any position taken may materially adversely affect the
     Taxes of any of the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (unless
     a contrary position is required by law), and file with the appropriate Tax
     Authority all consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns that include
     any of the Transferred Subsidiaries required to be filed (and shall
     promptly provide, as reasonably requested by, Buyer with copies of the
     portion of such Tax Returns that relate to the Transferred Subsidiaries).

          (c) Seller shall deliver to Buyer at the Closing all necessary
     forms and certificates complying with applicable law, duly executed and
     acknowledged, certifying that the transactions contemplated hereby are
     exempt from withholding under Code Section 1445.

          (d) After the Closing Date, each of Seller and Buyer shall promptly
     notify the other parties in writing upon receipt of written notice of the
     commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or
     of any demand or claim on any Asset Seller, any Transferred Subsidiary or
     Buyer which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of
     time, would be grounds for indemnification by the other party under Section
     6.5 of this Agreement. In the case of an audit or administrative or
     judicial proceeding that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of a
     Transferred Subsidiary, Seller shall have the sole right, at its expense,
     to control the conduct of such audit or proceeding; provided, however, that
     Seller shall not be entitled to settle any Tax, without Buyer's consent,
     which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, if the resolution of such
     Tax issues would have a material adverse effect on the Tax liability of the
     Transferred Subsidiary after the Closing Date. If Seller chooses to control
     the audit or proceeding, Buyer shall execute or cause to be executed powers
     of attorney or other documents necessary to enable Seller to take all
     actions desired by Seller with respect to such proceeding. In the case of
     an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding that relates to a

                                       43
<PAGE>

     Straddle Period of a Transferred Subsidiary, Buyer shall have the right, at
     its expense, to control the conduct of such audit or proceeding, provided,
     however, that (i) Seller shall have the right, at its expense, to
     participate in such proceeding and (ii) Buyer will act upon all reasonable
     recommendations made by Seller and (iii) Buyer will not settle or refuse to
     settle any such proceeding without Seller's consent if the terms of such
     settlement will have a material adverse effect on the amount of Seller's
     indemnification obligation under Section 6.5, which consent will not be
     unreasonably withheld. In the case that Seller gives written notice that it
     wishes to settle an item based on an offer from a Taxing Authority which
     relates solely to the pre-Closing portion of such Straddle Period, but
     Buyer does not settle such item, then Seller's liability for Taxes and
     related costs and expenses relating to such an item shall not exceed the
     amount that Seller's liability for such Taxes and related costs and
     expenses would have been if the item had been settled on the terms and at
     such time offered by such Taxing Authority. The parties shall promptly
     notify the others if such party decides not to control the defense or
     settlement of any proceeding which they are entitled to control pursuant to
     this Agreement and the other parties thereupon shall be permitted to defend
     and settle such proceeding.

          (e) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with one another and use their
     reasonable best efforts to develop a plan to enable Seller and the
     Transferred Subsidiaries to undertake a restructuring of their businesses
     if requested by Seller prior to the Closing Date including any
     restructuring if an election under Section 338(h)(10) is not made under
     Section 6.4(f) of this Agreement ("Restructuring Transaction"). On or prior
     to the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall enter into, or cause to be
     entered into, such agreements as are necessary to implement any such plans
     for a Restructuring Transaction which are reasonably requested by Seller.
     Seller shall be liable for and pay all Taxes and related costs and
     expenses, including any additional transfer taxes related to the
     transactions under this Agreement, incurred as a result of any actions
     taken pursuant to this Section 6.4(e).

          (f) The parties agree to make an election under Section 338(h)(10)
     of the Code with respect to the acquisition of stock of any United States
     Transferred Subsidiary, provided that if Buyer provides written notice to
     Seller no later than twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date that such
     election would have an adverse tax effect on Buyer and provided, further,
     Seller decides to make such election, then Seller shall be liable for any
     incremental tax liability (solely as a result of lost Tax basis in assets
     subject to allowance for depreciation or amortization) to Buyer as a result
     of such election, provided that such indemnification shall be made in
     accordance with and subject to Sections 6.5 and 8.1(c) and (d) of this
     Agreement. Seller will furnish to Buyer the necessary information
     reasonably requested by Buyer to allow Buyer to provide the notice
     contemplated under this Section 6.4(f).

          (g) Buyer shall not, and shall cause any Transferred Subsidiary not
     to, carry back any net operating loss or other Tax attribute to a Pre-
     Closing Tax Period of such Transferred Subsidiary if such Transferred
     Subsidiary were included as part of a United States federal consolidated
     Tax Return or any group that files a combined, consolidated, or unitary
     foreign, state or local Tax Return. In all other cases, Buyer shall not
     carry back such loss or other Tax attribute without Seller's consent, which
     consent shall not be unreasonably withheld (except for a material loss or
     material Tax attribute if such carry back is required by the relevant Tax
     law). Except for refunds resulting from carry backs pursuant to the
     preceding sentence, all other Tax refunds relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
     Period shall be for the benefit of Seller. For

                                       44
<PAGE>

     purposes of Section 6.5(a), Taxes shall include the amount of Taxes which
     would have been paid but for the application of any credit or net operating
     loss or capital loss deduction attributable to Post-Closing Tax Periods.

          6.5. Tax Indemnity. (a) Subject to Sections 8.1(c) and (d) of this
Agreement, Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer and its affiliates (including, after
the Closing Date, the Transferred Subsidiaries) and the Buyer Indemnified
Persons (as defined in Section 8.1(a)) and hold them harmless from any Losses
(as defined in Section 8.1(a)) that they may incur arising out of or due to (i)
Taxes of each of the Transferred Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods,
(ii) Taxes of any other entity which is or has been an affiliate of one or more
of the Transferred Subsidiaries (other than any of the Transferred Subsidiaries)
as a result of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or otherwise, (iii) any
breach by Seller or any of its affiliates of any covenant contained in Sections
6.1(c)(ix)-(x), 6.4 or 6.5, (iv) any breach of any representation or warranty
made by Seller or any of its affiliates in Section 2.12 (including any related
Disclosure Schedule) without regard to any qualification contained therein as to
materiality, except to the extent that any such Losses are otherwise indemnified
pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), and (v) Excluded
Liabilities as it relates to Taxes; provided, however, that the amount of Taxes
and other Losses determined pursuant to this Section shall be reduced by the
reserve for Taxes on the Closing Statement (other than any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income).

          (b) Subject to Sections 8.1(c) and (d) of this Agreement, Buyer and
     each Transferred Subsidiary shall indemnify Seller and its affiliates
     against all Taxes imposed on any (i) Transferred Subsidiaries for a Post-
     Closing Tax Period and (ii) Asset Sellers with respect to Taxes arising out
     of the ownership of the Assets with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period.

          (c)  In the case of any Straddle Period:

                (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes ("Property
        Taxes") of the Transferred Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
        shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire
        Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
        number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing
        Tax Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in
        the Straddle Period; and

                (ii) the Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries (other than
        Property Taxes) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if
        such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing
        Date.

          (d) Payment by the indemnitor of any amount due under this Section
     6.5 shall be made within ten days following written notice by the
     indemnitee that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing Authority
     is due, provided that the indemnitor shall not be required to make any
     payment earlier than two days before it is due to the appropriate Taxing
     Authority. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the
     provisions of Section 6.4(d) above, payment of the Tax to the appropriate
     Taxing Authority shall not be considered to be due earlier than the date a
     final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate Taxing
     Authority or court.

                                       45
<PAGE>

          (rrrr) Buyer and Seller shall share in the ratio of 50/50 all U.S. or
     foreign transfer, documentary, sales, use, excise, stamp, motor vehicle,
     registration, value added or similar Taxes (including all applicable real
     estate transfer or gains Taxes) and notary, filing or recording expenses or
     fees, if any, required to be paid in connection with this Agreement and the
     transactions contemplated hereby, including any interest charge, penalty or
     addition to tax with respect thereto. Each party shall be entitled to pay
     any such amounts on behalf of the other party, and the non-paying party
     shall promptly reimburse the paying party for any amounts so paid. Seller
     and Buyer shall timely cooperate in filing all Tax Returns as may be
     required to comply with the provisions of such Tax laws. Seller shall
     deliver to Buyer all necessary forms and certificates complying with
     applicable law, duly executed and acknowledged, certifying that the
     transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from withholding under the Tax
     laws.

          6.6.  Employees; Benefit Plans.

          (a) Defined Benefit Plans. Seller shall remain the sponsoring employer
     of the Pension Plan for Employees of Dresser-Rand Company and shall as
     sponsoring employer thereunder have any and all rights with respect to the
     plan assets, liabilities and obligations accrued through the Closing Date
     with respect to the plan.

          (b) Defined Contribution Plans. As soon as practicable after the
     Closing Date, Seller shall (A) cause the account balance of each Business
     Employee in all defined contribution plans in which the Business Employees
     participated (the "Seller 401(k) Plans") immediately prior to the Closing
     Date to fully vest, (B) cause the participation of each Business Employee
     who was participating in the Seller 401(k) Plans to cease as of the Closing
     Date and (C) to the extent permitted by applicable law, take such action as
     is reasonably necessary to treat such Business Employees as terminated and
     entitled to a distribution of their account balances under the Seller
     401(k) Plans. To the extent Buyer provides evidence reasonably satisfactory
     to Seller that it maintains a defined contribution plan, qualified under
     Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code, to which Business Employees can
     rollover their vested account balances and in the event such Business
     Employees elect to do so, Seller will cooperate with Buyer to effectuate
     such rollovers.

          (c) Welfare Benefit Plans. (i) As of the Closing Date, Seller shall
     retain or assume sponsorship of the Voluntary Employees' Benefit
     Association and will continue to be responsible for any and all liabilities
     and obligations incurred prior to the Closing Date.

                (ii) As of the Closing Date Seller shall be responsible for
        satisfying all liabilities and obligations with respect to any Business
        Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is receiving benefits pursuant to
        the Seller's long term disability program.

          (d) Post-Retirement Benefit Plan. (i) Seller shall retain the
     liability in respect of any Business Employee who retires or otherwise
     terminates employment with Seller prior to the Closing Date and is entitled
     to post-retirement welfare benefits from Seller on or after the Closing
     Date.

                (ii) With respect to any Business Employee who has not retired
        prior to the Closing Date and who becomes employed by Buyer or the
        Transferred

                                       46
<PAGE>

        Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible
        for providing post-retirement welfare benefits if and only to the extent
        that it adopts any plan to provide such post-retirement benefits to any
        such employees. Nothing contained herein shall require Buyer to adopt,
        establish or maintain any post-retirement welfare benefits.

          (e) Stock Appreciation Right Plan. Seller shall retain the Dresser-
     Rand Company Stock Appreciation Right Plan (the "SARP") and shall be solely
     and entirely responsible for satisfying any and all obligations and
     liabilities with respect to the SARP.

          (f) Continuation of Comparable Benefit Plans. Until December 31, 2000,
     Buyer shall, or shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to, maintain, (A)
     salaries and bonuses for Business Employees at levels no less favorable
     than the salary and bonus rates in effect immediately prior to the Closing
     Date for such Business Employees and (B) employee benefit plans and
     arrangements (other than any special bonus or incentive arrangements not in
     the Ordinary Course of Business and other than any benefit plans described
     in Sections 6.6(b) and 6.6(d)) for Business Employees that, in the
     aggregate, are no less favorable than the Business Group Plans in effect
     immediately prior to the Closing Date, except for such changes as may be
     required by law including, without limitation, any applicable qualification
     requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code. Thereafter, Buyer shall, or
     shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to, provide employee benefit plans
     and arrangements that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
     provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer for the Business
     Employees who continue their employment with Buyer or the Transferred
     Subsidiaries.

          (g) Prior Service; Deductibles. Buyer shall recognize each Business
     Employee's service with Seller or any Subsidiary as of the Closing Date as
     service with Buyer for all purposes, including eligibility, vesting and
     benefit levels, as applicable in Buyer's employee welfare benefit plans,
     employee pension plans, vacation, disability, severance and other employee
     benefit plans or policies, but only to the extent that such service was
     recognized by Seller or any Subsidiary under the applicable Business Group
     Plans. In addition, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Transferred
     Subsidiaries to, waive any pre-existing condition limitations and
     eligibility waiting periods under the employee welfare benefit plans
     applicable to Business Employees or their respective dependents, but only
     to the extent that such service was recognized under such plans for such
     purposes. Buyer shall recognize (or cause to be recognized) the dollar
     amount of all expenses incurred by Business Employees and their respective
     dependents during the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for
     purposes of satisfying the deductibles and co-payment or out-of-pocket
     limitations for such calendar year under the relevant employee welfare
     benefit plans of Buyer.

          (h) Accrued Vacation. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Transferred
     Subsidiaries to, credit each current Business Employee with the accrued and
     unused vacation days and any personal and sickness days accrued in
     accordance with the vacation and personnel policies and labor agreements of
     Seller or any Subsidiary in effect as of the Closing Date.

          (i) Severance Obligations. Seller and Buyer agree that the
     transactions contemplated hereby shall not constitute a severance of
     employment of any Business Employee prior to the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated hereby, and that such employees will

                                       47
<PAGE>

     be deemed for all purposes to have continuous and uninterrupted employment
     before and immediately after the Closing Date. Except as required by law,
     Buyer shall provide severance and other separation benefits to each
     Business Employee terminated by Buyer within one year following the Closing
     Date upon terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the severance
     and other separation benefits provided by Seller and its affiliates in
     effect on the date of this Agreement. Buyer shall be responsible for any
     claim made on or after the Closing Date by any Business Employee for
     severance or other separation benefits including, without limitation, in
     connection with the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby,
     for any contractual, statutory or other claims arising out of or in
     connection with any termination of employment on or after the Closing Date.

          (j) Annual Incentive Compensation. Effective as of the Closing Date
     through December 31, 2000, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Transferred
     Subsidiaries to, maintain the annual incentive compensation plans in which
     any of the Business Employees participate immediately prior to the Closing
     Date. In addition, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries
     to, pay all bonuses payable under such incentive compensation plans to any
     Business Employees in respect of calendar year 2000 no later than March 31,
     2001; provided, however, that Seller shall remain liable for payment of any
     retention or stay bonus to which a Business Employee becomes entitled after
     the Closing Date under an agreement or arrangement established by Seller
     prior to the Closing Date and set forth on Schedule 2.16(ix) of the
     Disclosure Schedule.

          (k) Cooperation and Transition Services. The parties agree to furnish
     each other with such information concerning employees and employee benefit
     plans, and to take all such other action, as is necessary and appropriate
     to effect the transactions contemplated hereby. From and after the Closing
     Date until the earlier of (x) the date of the last payroll for the Covered
     Employees (as defined below) covering December 31, 2000 or (y) sixty (60)
     days following written notice from Seller to Buyer of the sale of Seller or
     substantially all of Seller's assets (the "Transition Period"), (i) Seller
     shall, on behalf of Buyer, perform payroll services for Buyer for United
     States Business Employees (the "Covered Employees") and (ii) Buyer shall
     provide health, life, dental, disability and other employee welfare
     benefits to the Covered Employees pursuant to, and the Covered Employees
     shall continue to be eligible for and participate in, Seller's health
     (other than retiree health), life, dental, disability and other employee
     welfare benefit plans maintained for active employees of Seller ("Seller's
     Welfare Plans"). Seller shall continue to administer on behalf of Buyer,
     Seller's Welfare Plans for the benefit of the Covered Employees and shall
     provide Buyer with reasonable claim detail with respect to claims incurred
     by the Covered Employees during the Transition Period. Buyer shall
     reimburse Seller for all claims, premiums and additional costs paid or
     otherwise incurred by Seller (including reasonable internal administrative
     costs) as a result of the Covered Employees' continuation in Seller's
     Welfare Plans during the Transition Period.

          (l) Foreign Employment Matters. (i) Employment. Without limiting the
     generality of Sections 6.6(f), 6.6(g), 6.6(h) and 6.6(j), as of the Closing
     Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to, assume
     or retain and be responsible for the employment (including any employment
     contracts) of the Business Employees who are employed outside the United
     States (the "Foreign Employees"), and Buyer shall, or shall cause the
     Transferred Subsidiaries to, take any and all actions necessary or
     appropriate (if any) to

                                       48
<PAGE>

     continue the employment of such Foreign Employees and assume or retain all
     obligations and liabilities relating to their employment (including, but
     not limited to, any employment contracts) under applicable laws and
     practices without Seller or any of its affiliates having any liability to
     any such employees for severance, redundancy, termination, payment in lieu
     of notice, indemnity or other payments to any of such employees by reason
     of, or as a result of, the actions contemplated by this Agreement.

                (ii) Employee Benefit Plans for Foreign Employees. Without
        limiting the generality of Sections 6.6(a), 6.6(b), 6.6(d) and 6.6(f),
        effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the
        Transferred Subsidiaries to, maintain, establish and/or qualify or
        register with applicable regulatory authorities employee benefit plans
        for, or shall extend existing Foreign Business Group Plans to, the
        Foreign Employees to the extent required by applicable law and, for not
        less than one year following the Closing Date, provide benefits to the
        Foreign Employees on terms and conditions which are no less favorable in
        the aggregate, to those provided to Foreign Employees by Seller, any
        Subsidiary, or their respective subsidiaries immediately prior to the
        Closing Date.

          (m) No Right to Employment. Nothing herein expressed or implied shall
     confer upon any of the employees of Seller, Buyer, or any of their
     affiliates, any additional rights or remedies, including, without
     limitation, any additional right to employment, or continued employment for
     any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason
     of this Agreement.

          6.7. Labor Matters. (a) Buyer and Seller agree that for purposes of
the WARN Act, the Closing Date shall be the "effective date" as such term is
used in the WARN Act. Buyer acknowledges and represents that it has no present
intent to engage in or permit a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" with respect to
Seller or any Subsidiary as defined in the WARN Act. Buyer shall not, at any
time prior to 90 days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "mass layoff" or
"plant closing" affecting in whole or in part with respect to Seller or any
Subsidiary or as defined in the WARN Act, without notifying Seller in advance
and without complying with the notice requirements and other provisions of WARN.
In addition, Buyer shall provide a full defense to, and indemnify Seller for any
loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including attorney's fees and other
costs of defense) which Seller may incur in connection with, any suit or claim
of violation brought against Seller under WARN for any actions taken by Buyer
with respect to Seller or any Subsidiary or any employee affected by this
Agreement. Seller agrees that between the date hereof and the Closing Date, it
shall cause each Subsidiary not to effect or permit a "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" as these terms are defined in the WARN Act with respect to any
Transferred Subsidiary without notifying Buyer in advance and without complying
with the notice requirements and all other provisions of the WARN Act.

          (b) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in connection with any
     required notification to, or any required consultation with, the employees,
     employee representatives, work councils, unions, labor boards and relevant
     government agencies concerning the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement with respect to the Foreign Employees of any Subsidiary.

          (c) The parties intend that there will be continuity of employment
     with respect to all the Business Employees. It is agreed that prior to, or
     in connection with, the Closing, Buyer shall take no action to cause Seller
     or any of its subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Business
     Employee, and neither Seller nor any of its subsidiaries shall be under any
     obligation to terminate any Business Employee prior to or on the Closing
     Date. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer employment, commencing
     on the Closing Date, to all Business Employees, including those on
     vacation, leave of absence, disability or layoff, employed on the day
     immediately preceding the Closing Date, on the same terms (including
     salary, fringe benefits, job responsibility and location) as those provided
     to such Business Employees by Seller or its subsidiaries on the day
     immediately preceding the Closing Date.

          6.8. Covenant to Satisfy Conditions. Each party hereto agrees to use
all reasonable efforts to insure that the conditions set forth in Article IV and
Article V hereof are satisfied, insofar as such matters are within the control
of such party.

          6.9. Contact With Customers and Suppliers. Prior to the Closing, Buyer
and its representatives shall contact and communicate with the employees,
customers, suppliers and licensors of the Compression Services Business in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby only with the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed
and may be conditioned upon a designee of Seller being present at any such
meeting or conference.

          6.10. Projections. In connection with Buyer's investigation of the
Compression Services Business, Buyer may have received, or may receive, from
Seller, the Subsidiaries, their affiliates and/or their respective
representatives certain projections and other forecasts for the Compression
Services Business and certain business plan and budget information. Buyer
acknowledges that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, (ii) Buyer is familiar with such
uncertainties, (iii) Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to it, and (iv) Buyer will not assert
any claim against Seller, any Subsidiary, any of their affiliates or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates or representatives,
or hold Seller, any Subsidiary, any of their affiliates or any such persons
liable, with respect thereto.

          6.11. Competition. (a) Parent agrees that from the Closing until the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, it will not directly or indirectly
engage or invest in any business in competition with the Compression Services
Business as conducted immediately prior to the Closing. It is understood and
agreed that (i) Parent shall not be deemed to be in default with respect to the
foregoing covenants as a result of any investment it may make in not more than
five percent of the outstanding shares or other units of any security subject to
the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, (ii) the provisions of this Section 6.11(a) shall not apply to any
business activities of Parent, or any of its direct or indirect affiliates,
actually being conducted as of the date hereof, other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries and the Assets, (iii) this Section 6.11(a) shall not be construed
to prohibit Parent, directly or through any affiliate, from hereafter acquiring
and continuing to own and operate any entity which has operations that compete
with the Compression Services Business as conducted immediately prior to the
Closing if such operations account for no more than twenty percent

                                       50
<PAGE>

(20%) of such entity's (including its subsidiaries and divisions) consolidated
revenues, and (iv) the provisions of this Section 6.11(a) shall not be construed
to prohibit Parent, directly or through any affiliate, from selling inventory or
other assets currently owned by a subsidiary or affiliate.

          (b) In the event that the covenants contained in Section 6.11(a)
     are more restrictive than permitted by law, the parties hereto agree that
     the covenants contained in Section 6.11(a) shall be enforceable and
     enforced to the extent permitted by law.

          (c) During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on
     the earlier of (i) the second anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the
     date of termination of this Agreement, each of Parent and Seller will not,
     directly or indirectly, (A) solicit or seek to employ any Business Employee
     who is actively engaged by Seller or one of its subsidiaries in the
     Compression Services Business as of the date of this Agreement; or (B)
     cause or attempt to cause any such Business Employee to resign or sever
     such person's relationship with the Compression Services Business. The
     limitations set forth in this paragraph (c) shall not apply to any person
     whose employment is terminated, directly or indirectly, by Buyer or any of
     its affiliates; who responds to an advertisement that is placed in general
     circulation by or on behalf of Parent, Seller or any of their subsidiaries
     and that is not targeted at persons to whom paragraph (c) otherwise would
     apply; or who initiates employment discussions with Parent, Seller or any
     of their subsidiaries.

          (d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the
     remedy at law for any breach of the requirements of this Section 6.11 would
     be inadequate, and agrees and consents that without intending to limit any
     additional remedies that may be available, temporary and permanent
     injunctive and other equitable relief may be granted without proof of
     actual damage or inadequacy of legal remedy in any proceeding which may be
     brought to enforce any of the provisions of this Section 6.11.

          6.12. Asset Returns. In the event Buyer receives any assets of the
Compression Services Business that are not intended to be transferred pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, Buyer agrees to promptly return such assets to
Seller at Seller's expense. In the event any payments are made to Buyer
following the Closing with respect to accounts receivable that are not
attributable to the Compression Services Business or that relate to any Excluded
Assets or Excluded Liabilities, Buyer agrees to forward such payments to Seller
promptly. In the event any payments are made to Seller following the Closing
with respect to accounts receivable that are attributable to the Compression
Services Business or that relate to any Assets or Assumed Liabilities, Seller
agrees to forward such payments to Buyer promptly. In the event that, following
the Closing, Seller or any of the Subsidiaries receive any assets that were
intended to be, but were not, transferred pursuant to this Agreement at the
Closing, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer to such effect and shall comply with
its obligations in respect thereof contemplated by Section 1.12.

          6.13. Transition Services Agreements. On or prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver, or cause one or more of their
subsidiaries to execute and deliver, a transition services agreement
substantially in the

                                       51
<PAGE>

form attached as Exhibit F hereto (the "Seller Transition Services Agreement")
and a transition services agreement substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit G hereto (the "Buyer Transition Services Agreement", together with the
Seller Transition Services Agreement, the "Transition Services Agreements") with
respect to facilities and services currently shared by the Compression Services
Business and other business operations of Seller or its subsidiaries.

          6.14. Guarantees. Parent hereby guarantees full and timely performance
by Seller of Seller's obligations under this Agreement. Hanover hereby
guarantees full and timely performance by Buyer of Buyer's obligations under
this Agreement.

          6.15. Private Placement. From the period beginning on the date hereof
and ending on the date that is 150 days after the Closing Date (the "Private
Placement Period"), Hanover shall use its reasonable efforts to assist Parent to
accelerate the monetization of the shares of Hanover Stock owned by Parent as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement through the private
placement of such shares with institutional investors; provided that, during the
Private Placement Period, in the event Parent rejects an unconditional and
unqualified written bona fide offer to purchase all (but not less than all) of
the shares of Hanover Stock then owned by Parent in a private placement of such
shares at a net price (after taxes and transaction costs and expenses) in cash
equal to or above the value used in the determination of the Stock Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 1.7, Hanover's obligations under (a) this Section 6.15
and (b) the Registration Rights Agreement shall automatically terminate.

          6.16. Seller Credit Support Instruments. From and after the date
hereof, neither Seller nor any of its affiliates shall issue any standby letters
of credit, guarantees, indemnity bonds or other credit support instruments on
behalf of Seller and/or the Subsidiaries except in the Ordinary Course of
Business.

          6.17. Use of Name. (a) Each of Parent and Seller agrees that, until
the third anniversary of the Closing Date, it will not directly or indirectly
use the name "Dresser-Rand Compression Services" or "D-R Compression Services"
as or as part of any trade name, corporate name, domain name, trademark or
service mark or as part of any logo or design, except with respect to and in
connection with (i) binding transactions in effect as of or prior to the Closing
Date or (ii) the utilization of inventory and other consumable products owned by
Seller or any of its subsidiaries on the Closing Date. Neither Seller nor Parent
shall interfere in any manner with Hanover's or its subsidiaries use of the name
"D-R Compression Services."

          (b) Parent shall not permit the transfer of Seller or substantially
     all of Seller's assets, as the case may be, to any third party ("Third
     Party Acquirer") on terms permitting such Third Party Acquirer to use the
     name "Dresser-Rand Compression Services" as or as part of any trade name,
     corporate name, domain name, trademark or service mark or as part of any
     logo or design, except with respect to and in connection with (i) binding
     transactions in effect as of or prior to the Closing Date (other than a
     transaction comprising the transfer of Seller or substantially all of
     Seller's assets to a Third Party Acquirer) or (ii) the utilization of
     inventory and other consumable products owned by Seller or any of its
     subsidiaries on the Closing Date.

          6.18. Follow-On Relationship. (a) During the period from the earlier
of (a) fifteen months after the Closing Date or (b) January 1, 2002, until the
third anniversary of the earlier of such dates, Hanover shall purchase products,
goods and services with aggregate

                                       52
<PAGE>

purchase prices of not less than twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) from
Seller, its successors and/or any Third Party Acquirer, subject (i) in the case
of any products, goods and services previously delivered to the Compression
Services Business from other operating units of Seller or its subsidiaries, to
reasonably agreeable pricing terms, it being understood that all other terms
shall continue as the terms for such products, goods or services during such
period and (ii) in the case of any new products, goods and services, to
reasonably agreeable pricing, delivery and warranty terms.

          (b) Hanover shall be relieved of its obligations pursuant to
     Section 6.18(a) in the event that Seller or a Third Party Acquirer
     continues to violate the provisions of Section 6.17(b) after receiving two
     written notices at least 14 days apart (with respect to two separate
     violations or an ongoing violation which is not terminated after delivery
     of the first notice) from Hanover or Buyer in good faith requesting that
     Seller or such Third Party Acquirer promptly discontinue using the name
     "Dresser-Rand Compression Services" in violation of Section 6.17(b) of this
     Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                  TERMINATION

          7.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

          (a)  by the mutual consent of Seller and Buyer;

          (b) by Buyer if the Closing has not occurred on or before December
     11, 2000, unless the failure of such consummation shall be due to the
     failure of Buyer to comply in all material respects with the
     representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained herein to
     be performed by Buyer on or before December 11, 2000;

          (c) by Seller if the Closing has not occurred on or before
     December 11, 2000, unless the failure of such consummation shall be due to
     the failure of Seller to comply in all material respects with the
     representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained herein to
     be performed by Seller on or before December 11, 2000; or

          (d) by either Seller or Buyer if any court or governmental
     authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or
     ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
     prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree or
     ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable.

          7.2. Procedure and Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the transactions
contemplated hereby by Seller or Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party. If this Agreement is
terminated and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are abandoned as
provided herein:

                                       53
<PAGE>

          (eeeee) Each party will redeliver all documents, work papers and other
     material of any other party relating to the transactions contemplated
     hereby, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the
     party furnishing the same;

          (fffff) The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue
     in full force and effect; and

          (ggggg) No party to this Agreement will have any liability under this
     Agreement to any other except (i) that nothing herein shall relieve any
     party from any liability for any breach of any of the representations,
     warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and (ii)
     as contemplated by paragraph (b) above and by Section 9.1.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                                INDEMNIFICATION

          8.1.  Indemnification.

          (a) Indemnification by Seller. (i) Subject to the limits set forth in
     this Section 8.1, Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its
     affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Transferred
     Subsidiaries) and their respective officers, directors, partners,
     stockholders, employees, agents and representatives (the "Buyer Indemnified
     Persons") harmless from and in respect of any and all losses, damages,
     costs and reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
     fees and expenses of counsel) (collectively, "Losses"), that they may incur
     arising out of or due to (A) any inaccuracy of any representation or the
     breach of any warranty, covenant, undertaking or other agreement of Seller
     contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule (other than with
     respect to Taxes) and (B) the Excluded Liabilities (other than with respect
     to Taxes). Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, (X)
     none of the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover from
     Seller or any of its affiliates for any claims for indemnity or damages
     with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of any representations or
     warranties, unless and until the total of all such claims in respect of
     Losses pursuant to this Section 8.1(a) exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Buyer
     Deductible") and then only for the amount by which such claims exceed such
     amount, and (Y) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
     recover more than an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase
     Price for any inaccuracies or breaches of representations or warranties
     hereof, it being understood that no such limit shall apply in the case of
     fraud.

                (ii) Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller and to take all other
        reasonable actions, and make all other reasonable omissions, to avoid
        and minimize Losses indemnified by Seller hereunder arising out of or
        due to any inaccuracy or breach of Section 2.17. This Article VIII
        constitutes the sole remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Persons against
        Seller and its affiliates regarding Losses relating to Environmental
        Laws or Hazardous Materials and the Buyer Indemnified Persons hereby
        waive all other rights or causes of action against Seller and its
        affiliates under or relating to Environmental Laws or Hazardous
        Materials.

                                       54
<PAGE>

          (b) Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the limits set forth in this
     Section 8.1, Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller, its
     affiliates and its and their agents and representatives (the "Seller
     Indemnified Persons") harmless from and in respect of any and all Losses
     that they may incur arising (A) out of or due to any inaccuracy of any
     representation or the breach of any warranty, covenant, undertaking or
     other agreement of Buyer or Hanover contained in this Agreement; (B) as a
     result of the conduct of the Compression Services Business or of any
     Transferred Subsidiary after the Closing Date; (C) under any guarantees,
     standby letters of credit or other forms of credit support provided by
     Seller or any of its affiliates to third parties in respect of obligations
     of the Compression Services Business or of any Transferred Subsidiary and
     (D) out of or due to the Assumed Liabilities. Anything to the contrary
     contained herein notwithstanding, (X) none of Seller Indemnified Persons
     shall be entitled to recover from Buyer or any of its affiliates for any
     claims for indemnity or damages with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of
     any representations or warranties, unless and until the total of all such
     claims in respect of Losses pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) exceeds
     $1,000,000 (the "Seller Deductible") and then only for the amount by which
     such claims exceed such amount, and (Y) Seller Indemnified Parties shall
     not be entitled to recover more than an amount equal to fifty percent (50%)
     of the Purchase Price for any inaccuracies or breaches of representations
     or warranties hereof, it being understood that no such limit shall apply in
     the case of fraud.

          (c) Indemnification Calculations. (i) The amount of any Losses for
     which indemnification is provided under this Article VIII shall be computed
     net of any insurance proceeds received by the indemnified party in
     connection with such Losses. If an indemnified party receives insurance
     proceeds in connection with Losses for which it has received
     indemnification, such party shall refund to the indemnifying party the
     amount of such insurance proceeds when received, up to the amount of
     indemnification received. An indemnified party shall use commercially
     reasonable efforts to pursue insurance claims with respect to any Losses.
     If the amount with respect to which any claim is made under this Article
     VIII or under Section 6.5 (an "Indemnity Claim") gives rise to a currently
     realizable Tax Benefit (as defined below) to the party making the claim,
     the indemnity payment shall be reduced by the amount of such Tax Benefit
     actually available to the party making the claim. To the extent such
     Indemnity Claim does not give rise to a currently realizable Tax Benefit,
     if the amount with respect to which such Indemnity Claim is made gives rise
     to a subsequently realized Tax Benefit to the party that made the claim,
     such party shall refund to the indemnifying party the amount of such Tax
     Benefit when, as and if actually realized. Refunds relating to subsequent
     Tax Benefits shall be made on the last business day of the month following
     the year in which the Tax Benefit is realized. For the purposes of this
     Agreement, any subsequently realized Tax Benefit shall be treated as though
     it were a reduction in the amount of the initial Indemnity Claim, and the
     liabilities of the parties shall be redetermined as though both occurred at
     or prior to the time of payment of the initial Indemnity Claim. For
     purposes of this Section 8.1(c), a "Tax Benefit" to a party means an amount
     by which the tax liability of such party (or group of affiliates including
     such party) is actually reduced (including, without limitation, by
     deduction, reduction of income by virtue of increased tax basis or
     otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) as such amount may
     actually be reduced by, but not below zero, any increase in such party's
     tax liability as a result of its receipt of payment for such Indemnity
     Claim plus any related interest received from the relevant Taxing
     Authority. Where a party has other losses, deductions, credits or items
     available to it, the Tax Benefit from any losses, deductions, credits or
     items relating to the Indemnity Claim shall be deemed to be realized
     proportionately with any other losses, deductions, credits or

                                       55
<PAGE>

     items. For the purposes of this Section 8.1(c), a Tax Benefit is "currently
     realizable" to the extent that such Tax Benefit can actually be realized in
     the current taxable period or year or in any Tax Return with respect
     thereto (including through a carry back to a prior taxable period) or in
     any taxable period or year prior to the date of the Indemnity Claim. In the
     event that there should be a determination disallowing the Tax Benefit, the
     indemnifying party shall be liable to refund to the indemnified party the
     amount of any related reduction previously allowed or payments previously
     made to the indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 8.1(c). The amount
     of the refunded reduction or payment shall be deemed a payment under this
     Section 8.1(c) and thus shall be paid subject to any applicable reductions
     under this Section 8.1(c).

                (ii) The parties agree that any indemnification payments made
          pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as an
          adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
          applicable law.

          (d) Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations
     and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement or in any
     instrument delivered pursuant hereto will survive the Closing Date and will
     remain in full force and effect thereafter until the 18 month anniversary
     of the Closing Date, provided that (i) the representations and warranties
     set forth in Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.12, 2.13, 2.24, the first sentence of
     Section 2.1, and Sections 3.2 and 3.5 will survive the Closing Date and
     will remain in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable
     statute of limitations (after giving effect to waiver, mitigation or
     extension thereof) and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in
     Section 2.17 will survive the Closing Date and will remain in full force
     and effect until the third anniversary of the Closing Date; provided,
     further, that such representations or warranties shall survive (if at all)
     beyond such period with respect to any inaccuracy therein or breach
     thereof, written notice of which shall have been duly given within such
     applicable period in accordance with Section 8.1(e) hereof.

          (e) Notice and Opportunity to Defend. If there occurs an event which a
     party asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or
     8.1(b), the party or parties seeking indemnification shall notify the other
     party or parties obligated to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying
     Party") promptly. If such event involves (i) any claim or (ii) the
     commencement of any action or proceeding by a third person, the party
     seeking indemnification will give such Indemnifying Party prompt written
     notice of such claim or the commencement of such action or proceeding;
     provided, however, that the failure to provide prompt notice as provided
     herein will relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder
     only to the extent that such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party
     hereunder. In case any such action shall be brought against any party
     seeking indemnification and it shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the
     commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
     participate therein or, following the delivery by the Indemnifying Party to
     the party or parties seeking indemnification of the Indemnifying Party's
     acknowledgment in writing that the relevant Loss is an indemnified
     liability hereunder, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel selected
     by the Indemnifying Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to
     such party or parties seeking indemnification of such election so to assume
     the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
     party or parties seeking indemnification hereunder for any legal expenses
     of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such party
     or parties in connection with the defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party
     and the party seeking indemnification agree to

                                       56
<PAGE>

     cooperate fully with each other and their respective counsel in connection
     with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such action or asserted
     liability. The party or parties seeking indemnification shall have the
     right to participate at their own expense in the defense of such action or
     asserted liability. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of an
     action (A) no settlement or compromise thereof may be effected (i) by the
     Indemnifying Party without the written consent of the indemnified party
     (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (x)
     there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation
     of the rights of any person by any indemnified party and no adverse effect
     on any other claims that may be made against any indemnified party and (y)
     all relief provided is paid or satisfied in full by the Indemnifying Party
     or (ii) by the indemnified party without the consent of the Indemnifying
     Party and (B) the indemnified party may subsequently assume the defense of
     such action if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
     Indemnifying Party is not vigorously defending such action. In no event
     shall an Indemnifying Party be liable for any settlement effected without
     its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
     delayed).

          (f) Payment. On each occasion that any indemnified party shall be
     entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under this Section 8.1, the
     Indemnifying Party shall, at each such time, promptly pay the amount of
     such indemnification or reimbursement. If any indemnified party shall be
     entitled to indemnification under this Section 8.1, the Indemnifying Party
     shall pay the indemnified party's costs and expenses arising as a result of
     a proceeding directly relating to an indemnifiable Loss (including, without
     limitation, any reasonable fees paid to witnesses), periodically as
     incurred.

          (g) Tax Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
     Section 8.1 (other than as specifically set forth in Sections 8.1(c) and
