automatically converted into the right to  receive $7.90 in cash
(individually, the " _Per Share  Price_ " and, in the aggregate, the "
_Share  Consideration_ "), without interest thereon, upon the  surrender of
the certificate representing such share of Company  Common Stock in the

 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  in _Section 2.8_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or  destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond,  if required) in the
manner provided in _Section 2.10_ ). 

  



  

  (ii) __Owned Company Common  Stock_._ Each share of Company Common Stock 
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any direct or  indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the  Company, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time  (" _Owned Company Common Stock_ "),
shall be  cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or 
consideration paid therefor. 

  



  

  (iii) __Capital Stock of Merger  Sub_._ Each share of common stock, par
value  $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately  prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly  issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock par  value $0.01 per share of the
Surviving Corporation. Each  certificate evidencing ownership of such shares
of common stock  of Merger Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares
of  common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  



  

  (b) __Adjustment to Per Share  Price_._ The Per Share Price shall be
adjusted  appropriately (without duplication) to reflect the economic 
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend  (including
any dividend or distribution of securities  convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization,  recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of  shares or other like change with respect to Company Common
Stock  occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective 
Time. 

  



  

  (c) __Statutory Rights of Appraisal_._ 

  



  

  (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in  this Agreement,
all shares of Company Common Stock that are  issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time  and held by Company Stockholders who
shall have neither voted in  favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in
writing and who  shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory
rights  of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock  in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively,  " _Dissenting Company
Shares_ ") shall not be  converted into, or represent the right to receive,
the Per Share  Price pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_. Such Company 
Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the  consideration that
is deemed to be due for such Dissenting  Company Shares in accordance with
the provisions of  Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting
Company  Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to 
perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their  rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such  Section 262 of the
DGCL shall no longer be considered to be  Dissenting Shares and shall
thereupon be deemed to have been  converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the  Effective Time, the right to receive the Per
Share Price,  without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
or  certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company  Common
Stock in the manner provided in _Section 2.8_. 

  



  

  (ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice  of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company,  withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments received  by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company
Shares and  (B) the opportunity to control all negotiations and  proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal in respect of  Dissenting Company
Shares. The Company shall not, except with  the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any  payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, or settle or  offer to settle any such demands for payment, in
respect of  Dissenting Company Shares. 

  



  

  (d) __Treatment of Company Options and Company Stock  Based Awards_._ 

  



  

  (i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and  without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, each  Company Option that is not yet
vested or exercisable (the  " _Unvested Options_ ")  and/or that  has an
exercise price greater than or equal to the Per Share  Price (the " _Out of
the Money Options_ " and,  together with the Unvested Options, the "
_Assumed  Options_ ") and that is outstanding under any Company  Stock Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be  assumed by Parent and
converted automatically at the Effective  Time into an option, with respect
to shares of the common stock,  par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("
_Parent  Stock_ "), on terms and conditions otherwise the same as  those of
such Assumed Options, except that (A) the number  of shares of Parent Stock
subject to each such Assumed Options  shall be determined by multiplying the
number of shares of  Company Common Stock underlying such Assumed 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  Options immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction  (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which  is the Per Share Price and the
denominator of which is the  average closing price of Parent Stock on the New
York Stock  Exchange as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the five 
(5) full trading days ending on the date that is two  (2) trading days prior
to the Closing Date (rounded down to  the nearest whole share), and (B) the
exercise price per  share of Parent Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent)  shall equal (x) the per share exercise price for the  Company Common
Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such  Assumed Options immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided  by (y) the Exchange Ratio. The
conversion of Assumed  Options shall comply with the requirements of Sections
409A  and 424 of the Code. 

  



  

  (ii) With respect to each Company Option other than the  Assumed Options
(the " _Unassumed Options_ "), upon  the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this  Agreement, the Company shall take such action as may be 
reasonably necessary so that immediately prior to the Effective  Time by
virtue of and subject to the Merger, each Unassumed  Option that remains
outstanding as of immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be cancelled
and automatically converted  into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest),  if any, equal to the product obtained by multiplying 
(x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock  that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option  immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (y) the Per  Share Price, less the per share exercise
price of such Company  Option (the " _Option Consideration_ " and,  together
with the Share Consideration, the " _Merger  Consideration_ ") (it being
understood and agreed that  such exercise price shall not actually be paid to
the Company by  the holder of a Company Option). Parent shall, or shall
cause  the Company to, pay to holders of Unassumed Options the Option 
Consideration, without interest thereon, less applicable Taxes  required to
be withheld with respect to such payments, as soon  as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time. The  Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to effect  the transactions contemplated by this  _Section
2.7(d)(ii)_ under all agreements governing  such Unassumed Options and any
other plan or arrangement of the  Company, including delivering all required
notices and making  any determinations  and/or  resolutions of the Company
Board or a committee thereof. At  least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the  Company shall deliver to Parent a resolution of the plan 
administrator authorizing the treatment of the Unassumed Options  described
herein and all such actions taken to effectuate this  _Section 2.7(d)(ii)_
are consistent with the terms of  the applicable Company Stock Plan. 

  



  

  (iii) Each Company Stock-Based Award that is outstanding  under any
Company Stock Plan immediately prior to the Effective  Time, whether or not
then vested or earned, shall, by virtue of  the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder  thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted
automatically at the  Effective Time into an award based upon Parent Stock,
on terms  and conditions otherwise the same as those of the related  Company
Stock-Based Award, except that the number of shares of  Parent Stock
underlying the Company Stock-Based Award as of the  Effective Time shall be
the number of shares of Company Common  Stock underlying such Company Stock-
Based Award immediately  prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio  (rounded down to the nearest whole share). 

  



  

  (iv) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective  Time, and in
no event later than ten (10) Business Days  thereafter, Parent shall file
with the SEC a registration  statement on  Form S-8  with respect to (A)
the shares of Parent Stock issuable  upon exercise of the Company Options
that are assumed by Parent  hereunder and (B) the shares of Parent Stock
subject to or  issued in respect of any Company Stock-Based Award that are 
assumed by Parent hereunder, and Parent shall exercise  reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such  registration statement for so
long as such Company Options or  Company Stock-Based Awards remain
outstanding. Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall not  issue any shares of Parent Stock in respect of any
Company  Option or Company Stock-Based Award until the  Form S-8  to be
filed as herein has become effective. 

  



  

  (v) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the  obligations and
succeed to the rights of the Company under the  Company Stock Plans with
respect to the Assumed Options and  Company Stock-Based Awards. Prior to the
Effective Time, the  Company and Parent shall take all action required to
reflect the  transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.7(d)_,  including
(A) the conversion of the Assumed Options that  are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time pursuant  to _Section 2.7(d)(i)_ , and (B) the
conversion of the  Company Stock-Based Awards that are outstanding
immediately  prior to the Effective Time pursuant to  _Section 2.7(d)(iii)_,
and the substitution of Parent  for the Company thereunder to the extent
appropriate to 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  effectuate the assumption of such Company Stock Plans by Parent.  From and
after the Effective Time, all references to the Company  (other than any
references relating to a "change in  control" of the Company) in each Company
Stock Plan and in  each agreement evidencing any award of Assumed Options
or  Company Stock-Based Awards shall be deemed to refer to Parent. 

  



  

  (vi) The Company agrees to take any and all actions  reasonably necessary
to approve and effectuate the foregoing  provisions of this _Section 2.7(d)_
including making  any determinations  and/or  resolutions of the Company
Board or a committee thereof or of  any administrator of a Company Stock
Plan. 

  



  

  (e) __Company ESPP; Company 401(k) Plan; Deferred  Compensation Plan_._ 

  



  

  (i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all  actions
reasonably necessary to cause the rights of participants  in the Company ESPP
with respect to any offering period then  underway to be determined by
treating the last business day  prior to, or if more administratively
advisable, the last  payroll date of the Company immediately prior to, the
Effective  Time, as the last day of such offering period and by making such 
other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the  shortened and
final offering period but otherwise treating such  shortened and final
offering period as a fully effective and  completed offering period for all
purposes under the Company  ESPP. 

  



  

  (ii) Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a  participant, each share
of Common Stock purchased under the  Company ESPP prior to the Effective Time
will be treated as a  share of Company Common Stock in accordance with 
_Section 2.7(a)(i)_. 

  



  

  (iii) The Company shall take all actions reasonably  necessary so that the
Company ESPP shall terminate immediately  after the purchase described in
_Section 2.7(e)(i)_  subject to and conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Effective  Time. All amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the 
participants in the Company ESPP that have not been used to  purchase Common
Stock prior to the Effective Time will be  returned to the participants
without interest pursuant to the  terms of the Company ESPP. 

  



  

  (iv) Effective as of no later than the day immediately  preceding the
Closing Date, each of the Company and any ERISA  Affiliate shall terminate
any Employee Plan that includes a Code  Section 401(k) arrangement (a "
_Terminating  Plan_ ") pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board in  a
form reasonably acceptable to Parent and approved by Parent  prior to their
execution. The Company shall provide Parent with  evidence that such
Terminating Plan(s) have been terminated  before the Closing Date, and shall
take such other actions in  furtherance of terminating such Terminating
Plan(s) as Parent  may reasonably require. Parent shall take all steps
reasonably  necessary to permit each Person who has received an eligible 
rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of  the Code),
including rollovers of any outstanding loans from  each 401(k) Plan, if any,
to roll such eligible rollover  distribution as part of any lump sum
distribution to the extent  permitted by each Terminating Plan into an
account under  Parents 401(k) plan (the " _Parent s 401(k)  Plan_"). 

  



  

  (v) Within the  30-day  period prior to the Closing Date, and subject to,
and  conditioned upon, the occurrence of the Effective Time, the  Company
shall terminate the 3Com Corporation 2005 Deferred  Compensation Plan,
amended and restated effective  January 1, 2009 (the " _Deferred
Compensation  Plan_ "). Notwithstanding anything herein to the  contrary,
nothing in _Section 5.1_ or any other  provision of this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from  taking, or otherwise require the Company to obtain
Parents  approval to take, any and all action necessary to implement the 
termination of the Deferred Compensation Plan. As soon as  administratively
practicable following the effective date of the  termination of the Deferred
Compensation Plan, the Company shall  commence distributing the assets of the
Deferred Compensation  Plan in accordance with the requirements of Section
409A of  the Code. The termination of the Deferred Compensation Plan and 
the distribution of the assets of the Deferred Compensation Plan  shall be
complete as soon as administratively practicable but in  no event later than
fifteen (15) Business Days following  the Closing Date. 

  



  

  (vi) The Company agrees to take any and all actions  reasonably necessary
to approve and effectuate the foregoing  provisions of this _Section 2.7(e)_
including making  any determinations  and/or  resolutions of the Company
Board or a committee thereof or of  any plan administrator. 

   
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  Section 2.8 __Exchange  of Certificates_._ 

  



  

  (a) __Payment Agent_._ Prior to the  Effective Time, Parent shall select a
bank or trust company  reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
payment agent  for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ "). 

  



  

  (b) __Exchange Fund_._ On and after  the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be  deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to
the holders of  shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions
of  this _Article II_, an amount of cash sufficient to pay  the aggregate
Share Consideration when necessary for such  payments (such fund, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The  Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. Until  disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this  Agreement, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Payment  Agent,
as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in  obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or  obligations of an agency of
the United States of America or any  agency or instrumentality thereof which
are backed by the full  faith and credit of the United States of America, in
commercial  paper obligations rated  A-1 or  P-1 or  better by Moodys
Investors Services Inc. or  Standard and Poors Corporation, or in deposit 
accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances  of, repurchase or
reverse repurchase agreements with, or  Eurodollar time deposits purchased
from, commercial banks, each  of which has capital, surplus and undivided
profits aggregating  more than $500 million (based on the most recent
financial  statements of the banks which are then publicly available at the 
SEC or otherwise). Any interest and other income resulting from  such
investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that  there are any losses
with respect to any such investments, or  the Exchange Fund diminishes for
any reason below the level  required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay
the cash amounts  contemplated by this _Article II_, Parent shall,  promptly
replace or restore (or cause to be replaced or  restored) the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the  Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient  for the Payment Agent to pay any
outstanding Share Consideration. 

  



  

  (c) __Payment Procedures_._ Promptly  following the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving  Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder  of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a 
certificate or certificates (the  " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior
to the  Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common 
Stock who is entitled to receive the Per Share Price pursuant to  _Section
2.7(a)(i)_: (i) a letter of transmittal  in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be  effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall  pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment  Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the  surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share  Price payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of  this _Article II_. Upon surrender of
Certificates for  cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent
or  agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter  of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in  accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other  documents as may be required by the
instructions, the holders of  such Certificates shall be entitled to receive
in exchange  therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by 
multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company  Common Stock
evidenced by such Certificate, by (y) the Per  Share Price (less any
applicable withholding taxes payable in  respect thereof), without any
interest thereon, and the  Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. The  Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance  with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent 
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance  with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or  accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates on the  Per Share Price payable upon the
surrender of such Certificates  pursuant to this _Section 2.8_. Until so
surrendered,  outstanding Certificates shall be deemed, from and after the 
Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Per  Share Price
(less any applicable withholding taxes payable in  respect thereof), without
interest thereon, payable in respect  thereof pursuant to the provisions of
this  _Article II_. Promptly following the Effective Time,  Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment  Agent to mail to each holder
of record (as of immediately prior  to the Effective Time) of outstanding
shares of Company Common  Stock who is entitled to receive the Per Share
Price pursuant to  _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ represented by book-entry on the 
records of the Company or the Companys transfer agent on  behalf of the
Company: (A) a letter of transmittal in  customary form and (B) instructions
for use in effecting  the surrender of the book-entry shares in exchange for
the Per  Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to the  provisions
of _Article II_. Upon return of a duly  completed and validly executed letter
of transmittal (in  accordance with the instructions thereto), and such
other  documents that may 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  be required by the instructions, the holders of such book-entry  shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an  amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying  (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock  held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and  (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding  taxes
payable in respect thereof) without any interest thereon. 

  



  

  (d) __Transfers of Ownership_._ In the  event that a transfer of ownership
of shares of Company Common  Stock is not registered in the stock transfer
books or ledger of  the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a

to  the terms of a written agreement with such Person or was  otherwise
lawful, except to the extent that any use or  disclosure of any Trade Secret
owned by another Person that was  not done in accordance with a written

Company  Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the foregoing, the 
Company and its Subsidiaries have a policy requiring employees  and certain
consultants and contractors to execute a  confidentiality and assignment
agreement substantially in the  Companys standard form previously provided
to Parent. The  Company and its Significant Subsidiaries have enforced such

investigation or proceeding made, conducted or brought  by a third party that
has been served upon or, to the Knowledge  of the Company, filed or

been notified in writing  of, any alleged infringement or other violation in
any material  respect by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
its  or their current products or services or other operation of the 
Companys or its Subsidiaries business of the  Intellectual Property Rights
of such third party (including by  "invitations" to take licenses to any
such  Intellectual Property Rights). As of the date hereof, to the 
Knowledge of the Company, there is no pending or threatened  claim
challenging the validity or enforceability of, or  contesting the Companys
or any of its Significant  Subsidiaries rights with respect to, any of the
Company  Intellectual Property or Company

  Intellectual Property Rights. As of the date hereof the Company  and its
Subsidiaries are not subject to any Order that restricts  or impairs the use
of any material Company Intellectual Property  or material Company
Intellectual Property Rights, other than  restrictions or impairments that
have not had and would not  reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  (g) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the  consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not as  a result of any Contract to
which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is a party result in (i)
Parent, the Company  or its Subsidiaries granting to any third party any
rights or  licenses to any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property 
Rights, being bound by or subject to any non-compete or other  material
restriction on the operation or scope of their  respective businesses, or the
release or disclosure of any Trade  Secrets (other than pursuant to this
Agreement) which would not  have been granted, bound or released absent such
transaction;  (ii) any right of termination or cancellation under any 
Company Intellectual Property Agreement which would not have  existed absent
such transaction; or (iii) the imposition of  any Lien on any Owned Company
Intellectual Property which would  not have been imposed absent such
transaction, except where any  of the foregoing (in clauses (i) through
(iii)) have not  had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company 
Material Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  (h) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Owned Company  Intellectual
Property, together with the Licensed Company  Intellectual Property,
constitutes all the Intellectual Property  that is necessary for the conduct
of the business of the Company  and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted,
except where the  failure of the foregoing to be true and correct would not 
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the  aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  (i) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in actual  possession of or have
necessary control over: (i) the  source code and object code for all Owned
Software and  (ii) the object code and, to the extent required for the  use
of the Company Software, the source code, for all other  Software material to
the operation of their businesses. The  Company and its Subsidiaries are in
possession of all  documentation (including all related engineering
specifications,  program flow charts, installation and user manuals) and
know-how  required for the use and revision of the Company Software as 
currently used, or that is being designed  and/or  developed for use, in the
businesses of Company and its  Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  (j) Except for source code for non-material Owned Software  that the
Company has made a business decision to license on a  "giveaway" basis, the
Company and its Subsidiaries  have disclosed source code to material Owned
Software only  pursuant to written confidentiality terms that reasonably 
protect the Companys rights in such Owned Software. Except  for source code
for non-material Owned Software that the Company  has made a business
decision to license on a  "giveaway" basis and except as disclosed in
accordance  with such confidentiality agreements or valid source code
escrow  agreements, no Person (other than Company and its Subsidiaries)  is
in possession of any source code for any Software included in  the material
Owned Software or has any rights to the same. 

  



  

  (k) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company  nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of any open source  license, except for any such
violation that has not had and  would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material  Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
Software  that contains or is derived from Designated Open Source has been 
incorporated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries into any  Software
that is Owned Company Intellectual Property, or has  otherwise been
distributed or licensed by the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries to third
parties, in a manner that renders  Software that is Owned Company
Intellectual Property subject to  license terms applicable to Designated Open
Source, except for  incidental bug fixes and any such incorporation,
distribution or  licensing that has not had and would not reasonably be
expected  to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. " _Designated  Open
Source_ " means freely available open source  Software that is licensed
pursuant to a license that upon  distribution of such open source Software
(and modifications  thereof), purports to require the distributing party to
provide  access to the corresponding source code  and/or  restrict ones
ability to charge for use of such Software,  including any Software licensed
pursuant to any GNU general  public license or lesser general public license
or other similar  open source Software license.

Software included in the Owned Company Intellectual  Property, or cause such
Software to irreparably damage or  corrupt any data, hardware, storage media,
programs, equipment  or communications, or (ii) permit any Person to access
such  Software without authorization, except in either case under  clause
(i) or (ii) above as would not reasonably be  expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  (m) Except as has not and would not reasonably be expected  to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and its  Significant Subsidiaries
are not obligated to support or  maintain Software licensed to third parties
except pursuant to  agreements terminable by the Company or relevant
subsidiary  (other than for cause) on a periodic basis and that provide for 
periodic payments to the Company; and (ii) except for  non-disclosure
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of  business and except for
source code agreements covered by  _Section 3.15(j)_ above, none of the
Company  Intellectual Property, including proprietary Software, is  subject
to any Contract or other obligation that would require  the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to divulge to any person,  or to assign or license to any
person, any source code,  proprietary algorithm, or Trade Secret. 

  



  

  (n) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain policies and  procedures

security policy regarding or any unauthorized  access of any data used in the
business of Company or its  Subsidiaries. The use and dissemination of any

the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any notice to, or seek
any  consent from, any employee, customer, supplier, service provider  or

  (a) Section 3.17(a)(i) and Section 3.17(a)(ii) of  the Company Disclosure
Letter, respectively, set forth a  complete and accurate list of (i) all
"employee  benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA),  whether or
not subject to ERISA, and all material International  Employee Plans, as
defined under applicable foreign Laws, and  (ii) all other employment, bonus,
stock option, stock  purchase or other equity-based, benefit, incentive
compensation,  profit sharing, savings, retirement (including early
retirement  and supplemental retirement), disability, insurance, vacation, 
incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental retirement  (including
termination indemnities and seniority payments),  severance, termination,
retention, change of control and other  similar fringe, welfare or other
employee benefit plans,  programs, agreement, contracts, policies or binding
arrangements  (whether or not in writing currently maintained) maintained
or  contributed to for the benefit of or relating to any current or  former
employee, director or consultant of the Company, any of  its Subsidiaries or
any other trade or business (whether or not  incorporated) which would be
treated as a single employer with  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under Section 414 of  the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "), or with  respect
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or  may have any
Liability, other than International Employee Plans  that are not material
(together the " _Employee  Plans_ "). With respect to each Employee Plan, to
the  extent applicable the Company has made available to Parent  complete
and accurate copies of (A) the most recent annual  report on Form 5500
required to have been filed with the  IRS for each Employee Plan, including
all schedules thereto;  (B) the most recent determination letter, if any,
from the  IRS for any Employee Plan that is intended to qualify under 
Section 401(a) of the Code; (C) the plan documents and  summary plan
descriptions, or a written description of the terms  of any Employee Plan
that is not in writing; (D) any  related trust agreements, insurance
contracts, insurance  policies or other documents of any funding
arrangements;  (E) any notices to or from the IRS or any office or 
representative of the DOL or any similar Governmental Authority  relating to
any compliance issues in respect of any such  Employee Plan; and (F) with
respect to each material  Employee Plan that is maintained in any  non-U.S.
jurisdiction  (the " _International Employee Plans_ "), to the  extent
applicable, (x) the most recent annual report or  similar compliance
documents required to be filed with any  Governmental Authority with respect
to such plan and  (y) any document comparable to the determination letter 
reference under clause (B) above issued by a Governmental  Authority relating
to the satisfaction of Law necessary to  obtain the most favorable tax
treatment. 

  



  

  (b) No Employee Plan is (i) a "defined benefit  plan" (as defined in
Section 414 of the Code),  (ii) a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in 
Section 3(37) of ERISA), (iii) a "multiple  employer plan" (as defined in
Section 4063 or 4064 of  ERISA) (in each case under clause (i), (ii) or 
(iii) whether or not subject to ERISA), or  (iv) subject to Section 302 of
ERISA, Section 412  of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. No Employee Plan
provides  health benefits that are not fully insured through an insurance 
contract (other than an Employee Plan that is a health or  dependent care
flexible spending account). 

  



  

  (c) Each Employee Plan has been established, maintained,  operated and
administered in material compliance with its terms  and with all applicable
Law, including the applicable provisions  of ERISA, the Code and any
applicable regulatory guidance issued  by any Governmental Authority. 

  



  

  (d) Each Employee Plan that is a nonqualified deferred  compensation plan
(as defined under Code Section 409A)  satisfies the applicable requirements
of  Sections 409A(a)(2), (3), and (4) of the Code, and  has, since January
1, 2005, been operated in material good  faith compliance with Sections
409A(a)(2), (3), and  (4) of the Code, and no payment pursuant to any such 
Employee Plan would subject any former or current employees,  contractor or
director to Tax pursuant to  Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code if made in
accordance with  the terms of the Employee Plan as in effect as of the date
of  this Agreement. No Employee Plan requires Parent or any of its 
Affiliates to gross up a payment to any former or current  employee, officer
or director of Company or any of its  Subsidiaries for Tax related payments
under Section 409A of  the Code. 

  



  

  (e) As of the date hereof, there are no Legal Proceedings  pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened on  behalf of or against any
Employee Plan, the assets of any trust  under any Employee Plan, or the plan
sponsor, plan administrator  or any fiduciary or any Employee Plan with
respect to the  administration, 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  accounting for or operation of such plans, other than routine  claims for
benefits that have been or are being handled through  an administrative
claims procedure. 

  



  

  (f) Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed  between June 1,
2008 and the date hereof, since  June 1, 2008 no Employee Plan is the subject
of an audit or  investigation by a Governmental Authority or is currently 
participating in a Governmental Authority-sponsored voluntary  compliance
amnesty or similar program. 

  



  

  (g) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or, to  the Knowledge of
the Company, any of their respective directors,  officers, employees or
agents has, with respect to any Employee  Plan, engaged in or been a party to
any non-exempt  "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in 
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA,  which could reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition  of a penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 502(i) of ERISA  or a Tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in
each case  applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any 
Employee Plan or for which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries has any
indemnification obligation. 

  



  

  (h) No Employee Plan that is a "welfare benefit  plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of ERISA  provides benefits to former employees of the
Company or its  ERISA Affiliates, other than as required pursuant to 
Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Law. 

  



  

  (i) Except as would not result in material liability or as  set forth on
Section 3.17(i) of the Company Disclosure  Letter: 

  



  

  (i) each Employee Plan that is intended to be  "qualified" under Section
401  and/or 409  of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
from  the IRS to such effect and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no  fact,
circumstance or event has occurred or exists since the  date of such
determination letter that would reasonably be  expected to materially and
adversely affect the qualified status  of any such Employee Plan; 

  



  

  (ii) to the extent applicable, each International Employee  Plan has been
approved by the relevant taxation and other  Governmental Authorities so as
to enable: (1) the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries and the participants
and  beneficiaries under the relevant International Employee Plan and  (2)
in the case of any International Employee Plan under  which resources are set
aside in advance of the benefits being  paid (a " _Funded International
Employee Plan_ "),  the assets held for the purposes of the Funded
International  Employee Plans, to enjoy the most favorable taxation status 
possible and the Company is not aware of any ground on which  such approval
may cease to apply; 

  



  

  (iii) except for the treatment of the Unassumed Options,  neither the
execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the  consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement  (whether alone or together with
any other event) will  (1) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or 
payable, or required to be provided, to any director, employee  or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, (2)
increase the amount or value of any  benefit or compensation otherwise
payable or required to be  provided to any such director, employee or
independent  contractor, or (3) result in the acceleration of the time  of
payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or  compensation. 

  



  

  (iv) all contributions, premiums and other payments  required to be made
with respect to any Employee Plan have been  timely made, accrued or reserved
for; 

  



  

  (v) to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred  and there
currently exists no condition or set of circumstances  in connection with
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  could be subject to any
material liability under the terms of  any Employee Plan, ERISA, the Code or
applicable regulatory  guidance issued by any Governmental Authority,
Collective  Bargaining Agreement or any other applicable Law; or 

  



  

  (vi) except as required by applicable Law or Order or this  Agreement, no
condition or term under any Employee Plan exists  which would prevent Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any  of its Subsidiaries from terminating or
amending any Employee  Plan without material liability to Parent or the 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (other than  ordinary
administration expenses or routine claims for benefits). 

  



  

  (j) Except as required by applicable Law or Order or the  terms of any
Employee Plans as in effect as of the date of this  Agreement, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has  any plan or commitment to amend in
any respect or establish any  new Employee Plan or to increase any benefits
under any Employee  Plan. 

  



  

  (k) No deduction for federal income tax purposes is  expected by the
Company to be disallowed for remuneration paid  by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of  Section 162(m) of the Code, including by reason of
the  transactions contemplated hereby. 

  



  

  (l) There is no contract, plan or arrangement (written or  otherwise)
covering any current or former employee, director or  consultant of the
Company or any Subsidiary that, individually  or collectively, would give
rise to the payment of any amount  that would not be deductible pursuant to
the terms of  Section 280G of the Code. The Company has provided Parent 
with good faith estimates of the potential excess parachute  payments to
disqualified individuals (in each case within the  meaning of Section 280G of
the Code) paid or payable by the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
result of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in
conjunction  with any other event. Except as expressly provided under the 
terms of this Agreement, including with respect to the treatment  of Company
Options, Company Stock-Based Awards, the Terminating  Plans, and the Deferred
Compensation Plan, the consummation of  the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, by itself, will  not cause or result in the acceleration of the
vesting or  payment of any compensation or benefits in any material amount 
under any Employee Plan. 

  



  

  Section 3.18 __Labor  Matters_._ 

  



  

  (a) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries is a party to any

operate its respective properties and assets. Each of Parent and  Merger Sub
is duly qualified to do business and is in good  standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its  properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make  such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so  qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in
the  aggregate, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the ability of  Parent and
Merger Sub to fully perform their respective  covenants and obligations under
this Agreement. Parent has  delivered or made available to the Company
complete and accurate  copies of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws
or other  constituent documents, as amended to date, of Parent and Merger

Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby  have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or other  action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub,
and no other  corporate or other proceeding on the part of Parent or Merger 
Sub is necessary to authorize, adopt or approve this Agreement  and the

determines in good faith (after consultation with its  independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, it  being understood and agreed that the

agreement and other  material documents with the party making such Superior
Proposal,  (C) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have  negotiated in

enable Parent to propose  changes to the terms of this Agreement that would
cause such  Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, 
(D) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith  (after
consultation with independent financial advisors and  outside legal counsel,
it being understood and agreed that the  "independence" of the Company
Boards independent  financial advisor will be determined by the Company
Board) any  changes to this Agreement proposed by Parent in a written offer 
capable of acceptance and determined that the Superior Proposal  would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes  were to be given
effect, and (E) in the event of any  material change to the financial or
other material terms of such  Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each
case, have  delivered to Parent an additional notice and

Acquisition Proposal, it being  understood and hereby agreed that the Company
Board may only  effect a Recommendation Change in response to or in
connection  with an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to and in accordance with 
_Section 5.3(a)(i)_) (such material fact, event,  change, development or set
of circumstances, an  " _Intervening Event_ ") shall have occurred and be 
continuing; _provided that_ (A) the Company Board  determines in good faith
(after consultation with independent  financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, it being  understood and agreed that the "independence" of the 
Company Boards independent financial advisor will be  determined by the
Company Board) that the failure to take such  action in light of the
Intervening Event would reasonably be  expected to be a breach of its
fiduciary duties, (B) the  Company shall have given Parent at least five (5)
Business  Days prior written notice of its intention to take such  action
and, no later than the time of such notice, provided  Parent with a written
explanation of the Company Boards  basis and rationale for proposing to
effect such Recommendation  Change, (C) if requested by Parent, the Company
shall have  negotiated in good faith with Parent during such five  (5)
Business Day notice period to enable Parent to propose  changes to the terms
of this Agreement that would obviate the  need for the Company Board to
effect such Recommendation Change,  (D) the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith  (after consultation with independent financial
advisors and  outside legal counsel, it being understood and agreed that
the  "independence" of the Company Boards independent  financial advisor
will be determined by the Company Board) any  changes to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and  determined that the failure to take such
action would reasonably  be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties
if such  changes were to be given effect, and (E) in the event of  any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to  such Intervening
Event, the Company shall have delivered to  Parent an additional notice and
the five (5) Business Day  notice period shall have recommenced. 

  



  

  (b) Nothing set forth in _Section 5.2_  or this _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere

the Company Stockholders that the Company Board  determines to make in good
faith (after consultation with its  outside legal counsel) in order to

the Company Board shall  have determined in good faith (after consultation
with outside  legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to
postpone  or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, including in order  to
give Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any new  information or
disclosure that the Company has sent to Company  Stockholders or otherwise
made available to Company Stockholders  by issuing a press release, filing
materials with the SEC or  otherwise (including in connection with any
Recommendation  Change). Unless the Company Board has effected a

to  solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the  adoption
of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law and  take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the  Requisite Stockholder Vote at the

  Section 5.5 __Access_._ At  all times during the period commencing with
the execution and  delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to  occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Article
VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company  shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and  its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel,  accountants and other agents and representatives
reasonable  access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to 
the properties, books and records, officers, agents and  personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company  shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to furnish to Parent  promptly, such information concerning the
Company and its  Subsidiaries business, personnel, assets, liabilities and 
properties as Parent may reasonably request; _provided,  however_ , that the
Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit  access to any documents or
information to the extent that  (a) any applicable Law or Order requires the
Company to  restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or 
information, (b) access to such documents or information  would, in the
Companys good faith opinion after  consultation with outside legal counsel,
result in the loss of  attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
other  applicable legal privilege applicable to such documents or 
information, (c) access to a Contract to which the Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would  violate or cause a default
under, or give a third party the  right terminate or accelerate the rights
under, such Contract  ( _provided that_ such contract is listed on  Section
3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter), or  (d) subject to the terms of
_Section 5.2(b)_ and  _Section 5.2(c)_, such documents or information
relate  directly or indirectly to any Acquisition Proposals that the 
Company or any of its Representatives may have received from any  Person or
any discussions or negotiations that the Company or  any of its
Representatives is having with respect to any  Acquisition Proposal or any
other proposals that could lead to  an Acquisition Proposal; and _provided
further_ , that no  information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation  conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this 
_Section 5.5_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any  representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this  Agreement or otherwise impair the
rights and remedies available  to Parent and Merger Sub hereunder. In the
event that any of the  Company or its Subsidiaries does not provide access
or  information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use  its
reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable  information to Parent
in a way that would not violate the  applicable Law, Order, Contract or
obligation or waive such a  privilege. Any investigation conducted pursuant
to the access  contemplated by this _Section 5.5_ shall be conducted  in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the  conduct of the business
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or  create an unreasonable risk of
material damage or destruction to  any material property or assets of the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries. Any access to the Companys or its 
Subsidiaries properties shall be subject to the  Companys reasonable
security measures and insurance  requirements. The terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality  Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by
Parent or  any of its financial advisors, business consultants, legal 
counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives in  connection with
any investigation conducted pursuant to the  access contemplated by this 
_Section 5.5_. All requests for data and  access under this Agreement shall
be made only to and through  one or more of the individuals designated in
writing by an  Executive Vice President of the Company.

Parent of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against  the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or directors (in their  capacity as such) relating
to this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby, and shall keep
Parent reasonably informed  regarding any such litigation. The Company shall
give Parent the  opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the
defense  and strategy of any such litigation and shall consider  Parents
views with respect to such litigation. 

  



  

  Section 5.7 __Section 16(b)  Exemption_._ The Company shall take all
actions  reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by 
this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities  of the
Company (including derivative securities) in connection  with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each  individual who is a
director or executive officer of the Company  to be exempt under  Rule
16b-3  promulgated under the Exchange Act.

of capital  stock or of any business, assets or property, or the imposition 
of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their  respective

benefits expected to be derived by Parent and its  Subsidiaries from the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement or (B) such actions reasonably

reputational  impact) on the operations or business (other than the
networking  business) of Parent and its Subsidiaries (assuming for purposes 
of this determination that Parent and its Subsidiaries are of  equivalent
size to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a  whole) in any material
jurisdiction. 

  



  

  (c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective  Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on  the other hand, shall keep
the other party promptly informed of  any material communication regarding
any of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement in connection with
any filings,  investigations with, by or before any Governmental Authority 
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated  hereby,
including any proceedings initiated by a private party.  If any party hereto
or Affiliate thereof shall receive a request  for additional information or
documentary material from any  Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act or any 
other Laws with respect to which any such filings have been  made, then such
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to  make, or cause to be made, as
soon as reasonably practicable and  after consultation with the other party,

other (or counsel of each  party, as appropriate) with copies of all written

  Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated  by this
Agreement, and (vii) cooperate and provide each  other with a reasonable
opportunity to participate in, and  consider in good faith the views of the
other with respect to,  all material deliberations with respect to all
efforts to  satisfy the conditions set forth _Section 7.1(b)_ and  _Section
7.1(c)_. 

  



  

  Section 6.3 __Proxy  Statement and Other Required Company  Filings_._ As
soon as practicable following the  date hereof, but in any event no later
than December 7,  2009, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy  Statement for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies 
from the Company Stockholders for use at the Company Stockholder  Meeting. If
the Company determines that it is required to file  with the SEC any Other
Required Company Filing under applicable  Law or Order, the Company shall
promptly prepare and file with  the SEC such Other Required Company Filing.
Parent and Merger  Sub shall furnish all information concerning Parent and
Merger  Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable) as is  required
to be included in the Proxy Statement or such other  filings, or that is
customarily included in such Proxy Statement  or such other filings in
connection with the preparation and  filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement and any Other  Required Company Filing. The Company shall use
reasonable best  efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to
the  Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the  filing
thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that  it will not comment
on, or that it has no additional comments  on, the Proxy Statement. Unless
the Company Board has effected a  Recommendation Change, neither the Company
nor any of its  Affiliates shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement or
any  Other Required Company Filing, or any amendment or supplement  thereto,
and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates, if  applicable, shall
correspond or otherwise communicate with the  SEC or its staff with respect
to the Proxy Statement or any  Other Required Company Filing in any such case
without providing  Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable opportunity to review
and  comment thereon or participate therein, as the case may be and  shall
include in such Proxy Statement or Other Required Company  Filing comments
reasonably proposed by Parent or Merger Sub.  Unless this Agreement is
earlier terminated pursuant to  _Article VIII_, the Company shall (i)
advise  Parent and Merger Sub promptly after it receives notice thereof,  of
any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for an  amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other  Required Company Filing, any
receipt of comments from the SEC or  its staff on the Proxy Statement or any
Other Required Company  Filing or any receipt of a request by the SEC or its
staff for  additional information in connection therewith, and  (ii) provide
Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all  correspondence with its
representatives, on the one hand, and  the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand with respect to the  Proxy Statement or Other Required Company Filings.
If at any  time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, any information 
relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their  respective
directors, officers or Affiliates, should be  discovered by the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub which should be  set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement  or any Other Required Company Filing so that the
Proxy Statement  or any Other Required Company Filing would not include any 
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material  fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the  statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which  they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such  information shall promptly notify the other, and an
appropriate  amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the
applicable  Other Required Company Filing describing such information shall 
be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent  required by
applicable Law or Order or the SEC or its staff,  disseminated to the Company
Stockholders. The Company shall  cause the Proxy Statement and any Other
Required Company Filing  to comply as to form in all material respects with
the  applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the  SEC
and Nasdaq. Unless the Company Board has effected a  Recommendation Change,
the Company shall include the Company  Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and, if applicable,  any Other Required Company Filings. 

  



  

  Section 6.4 __Anti-Takeover  Laws_._ The Company, Parent and Merger Sub 
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all  actions
necessary so that no state anti-takeover or other  similar Law or Order is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement  or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and,  if any anti-takeover statute is or becomes
applicable, to use  their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated  as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the  conditions set forth
in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize  the effect of such Law or Order
on this Agreement and the  transactions contemplated hereby.

to be satisfied, such notice to include a reasonably detailed  description of
the fact, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of  any event or circumstance

of which has been agreed by each of Parent and  the Company. None of the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and  Merger Sub, on the other hand,
hereby shall issue any public  release or make any public announcement or
disclosure concerning  this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement without the prior written consent of the other (which 
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or  conditioned), except
as such release, announcement or disclosure  may be required by applicable
Law or Order or the rules or  regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange  or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the
relevant  party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case  the

  Section 6.7 __Directors   and Officers Indemnification and
Insurance_._ 

  



  

  (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its  Subsidiaries to,
honor and fulfill in all respects the  obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under any and  all indemnification Contracts between the Company
or any of its  Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former 
directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or  officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the  Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ "). In  addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and  ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the  Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its  Subsidiaries
to) cause the certificate of incorporation and  bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the  Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to contain provisions  with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement  of expenses, covering acts and omissions of directors and 
officers (and any other employees or agents who otherwise would  be entitled
to similar benefits thereunder pursuant to the terms  thereof in effect on
the date hereof), in each case in their  respective capacities as such,
occurring at or prior to the  Effective Time, that are at least as favorable
as the  indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses  provisions
contained in the certificate of incorporation and  bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the  Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during  such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed,  amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required 
by applicable Law. 

  



  

  (b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of  _Section
6.7(a)_, to the fullest extent permitted by  applicable Law, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries  shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its  Subsidiaries to) indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified  Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including  reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), 
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and  amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim,  proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, whether civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative, to the
extent such claim,  proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or 
indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to  (i) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in  such Indemnified Persons capacity
as a director, officer,  employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or  other Affiliates occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, or  (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, in
each case regardless of whether such claim,  proceeding, investigation or
inquiry is made, occurs or arises  prior to, at or after the Effective Time.
In addition, to the  fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Surviving  Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause 
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) advance,  prior to the
final disposition of any claim, proceeding,  investigation or inquiry for
which indemnification may be sought  under this Agreement, promptly following
request by an  Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses 
(including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation  expenses) incurred
by such Indemnified Person in connection with  any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry upon  receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified
Person to repay  such advances if it is ultimately decided in a final,  non-
appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction  that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification.  In the event of any
such claim, proceeding, investigation or  inquiry, (A) the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall  have the right (but not the obligation) to
control the defense  thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood
that, by  electing to control the defense thereof, Parent will be deemed  to
have waived any right to object to the Indemnified  Persons entitlement to
indemnification hereunder with  respect thereto), (B) each Indemnified Person
shall be  entitled to retain his or her own counsel, which counsel shall  be
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Surviving  Corporation, whether or
not Parent shall elect to control the  defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry,  (C) the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause  the Surviving Corporation to) pay all reasonable fees and 
expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person,  promptly after
statements therefor are received, whether or not  Parent shall elect to
control the defense of any such claim,  proceeding, investigation or inquiry,
and (D) neither  Parent or the Surviving Corporation on the one hand nor
any  Indemnified Person on the other hand shall be liable for any 
settlement effected without his or her prior express written  consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in  this _Section 6.7(b)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement,  the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
not be obligated to  pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel
(selected by  a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties for any 
Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any  single action)
except to the extent that two or more of such  Indemnified Parties shall have
actual material conflict of  interest in such action. 

  



  

  (c) Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything  to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Company may  purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy on the  DandO Insurance. In the event that the Company purchases
such  a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent  and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such  "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to  honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all 
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under  the first
sentence of this _Section 6.7(c)_ for so  long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full  force and effect. In the event that the Company 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  does not so purchase a "tail" policy prior to the  Effective Time, during
the period commencing at the Effective  Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time,  Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain in effect  the Companys current directors and officers 
liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in  respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the  Effective Time, covering each person covered by
the DandO  Insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts  that
are equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance;  _provided however_ , in
satisfying its obligations under  this _Section 6.7(c)_, Parent and the
Surviving  Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in 
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the  Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three  hundred percent (300%)
amount, the " _Maximum Annual  Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company
represents and  warrants to be as set forth in Section 6.7(c) of the 
Company Disclosure Letter), _provided that_ if the annual  premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent  and the Surviving Corporation

assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge  into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or  surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger,  or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties  and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper 
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of  the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of  Parent and the Surviving

  (e) The obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.7_ shall not be

respect to the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their
respective  directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and 
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this  _Section 6.7_ is not
prior to or in substitution for  any such claims under such policies. 

  



  

  Section 6.8 __Employee  Matters_._ 

  



  

  (a) (i) __Health and Welfare  Plans__. For the period commencing at the 
Effective Time and ending on a date that is no earlier than the  six-month
anniversary thereof, Parent shall, or shall cause the  Surviving Corporation,
to maintain or provide for Continuing  Employees and, as applicable, their
eligible dependents,  benefits under Employee Plans or employee benefit
plans,  programs or policies of Parent or its Affiliates that provide  for
health and welfare benefits (excluding severance) that are  in the aggregate
no less favorable than such benefits maintained  for and provided to
Continuing Employees immediately prior to  the Effective Time. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent  shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to,  (A) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and  eligibility
waiting periods under any group health plans of  Parent or its Affiliates to
be waived with respect to Continuing  Employees and their eligible dependents
to the extent such  Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents were
not  subject to such preexisting conditions and limitations and  eligibility
waiting periods under the comparable Employee Plans  as of the time
immediately preceding the Closing, and  (B) provide each Continuing Employee
with credit for any  deductibles paid under any Employee Plan that provides
medical,  dental, vision or pharmaceutical benefits in the plan year in 
effect 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  as of the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible  or out of
pocket requirements under any medical, dental, vision  or pharmaceutical
plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or  its Subsidiaries that such
employees are eligible to participate  in after the Effective Time to the
same extent that such  expenses were recognized under the comparable Employee
Plan. For  purposes of this Section 6.8(a), " _Continuing  Employees_ "
shall include expatriate employees working  outside the U.S. whose benefits
and payroll are provided  under the plan, programs or arrangements offered to
employees  located in the U.S. 

  



  

  (ii) __Severance Plans_._ For the  period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the first  anniversary thereof, Parent shall, and shall cause
its  Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms as in  effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time the severance  plans maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and  shall recognize continuous
service with the Company or its  Subsidiaries, including predecessor
employers, of participating  Continuing Employees under such plans, but in
all cases solely  to the extent such service would have been recognized by
the  Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after  the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Continuing  Employees located in the
U.S. shall be eligible to  participate in severance plans or programs
available to  similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries 
solely with respect to continuous service credited from and  after the
Effective Time. 

  



  

  (iii) __401(k) Plan_._ Continuing  Employees located in the U.S. shall be
eligible to  participate in Parents 401(k) plan as soon as 
administratively practicable but in no event later than three  (3) months
after the Effective Time, and shall recognize  prior service with the Company
or its Subsidiaries, including  predecessor employers (but only to the extent
recognized by the  Company immediately prior to the Effective Time) for
purposes of  vesting under Parents 401(k) plan. To the extent that  Parent
is unable to provide for the participation of such  Continuing Employees
within the three (3) months after the  Effective Time, Parent shall pay to
such Continuing Employees  (to the extent then still employed by Parent or
its  Subsidiaries) an amount substantially equivalent to what they  would
have received pursuant to any match by Parent under the  Parents 401(k) Plan
had they become participants in  Parents 401(k) Plan, if any, without regard
to any Tax  benefit under such plan. 

  



  

  (iv) __Other Plan Participation; Service  Crediting_._ From and after the
Effective Time,  and except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.8 or as 
may result in duplication of coverage or benefits, Continuing  Employees
shall be eligible to participate in employee benefit  plans and programs of
Parent or a Subsidiary in accordance with  its then-applicable plans and
policies available to similarly  situated employees. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent  shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize
prior  service with the Company or its Subsidiaries, including  predecessor
employers (but only to the extent recognized by the  Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time) only for  purposes of service awards and
determining the amount of  vacation accruals, and not for purposes of any
other plan,  program or policy of Parent or its Subsidiaries, other than to 
the extent required by local Law or Order or as otherwise set  forth in this
Section. 

  



  

  (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Parent  shall, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance  with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective  Time all existing employment,
change of control, severance and  retention agreements between the Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former 
employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries,
on the other hand; provided, however, that nothing  in this Agreement shall
prohibit Parent or its Subsidiaries from  amending or terminating any such
plans or agreements, so long as  such amendment or termination complies with
the terms of any  such plans or agreements, including specifically obtaining
any  necessary or required consents. 

  



  

  (c) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, or as  may be agreed
upon by the Company and Parent prior to the  Closing Date, unused paid-time
off (PTO) days accrued by  Continuing Employees under the plans and policies
of the Company  and its Subsidiaries shall carry over to Parent or its 
Subsidiaries to the extent administratively practicable, and  each such
Continuing Employee shall be paid by the Company in  cash for any accrued and
unused paid-time off (PTO) days that  Parent determines are not
administratively practicable to  continue to honor. 

  



  

  (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are not  intended to confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto  any rights or remedies hereunder,
and nothing herein shall be  deemed to amend any Employee Plan to 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  reflect the terms of this Section 6.8. Furthermore, nothing  in this
Section 6.8 shall limit the right of Parent, the  Surviving Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries to terminate  the employment of any Continuing
Employee at any time.

hereby acknowledge that Parent and  the Company have previously executed the

  Section 9.6 __Severability_._ In  the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the  application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court
of  competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the 
remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and  effect and the
application of such provision to other persons or  circumstances will be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the  intent of the parties hereto. The

this Agreement  with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to
the  extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of  such
void or unenforceable provision. 

  



  

  Section 9.7 __Specific  Performance_._ The parties hereto hereby agree 
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any  provision of this

otherwise breached, and that  money damages or other remedies at law would
not be an adequate  remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties
hereto  acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or 
threatened breach by any party, of any of its covenants or  obligations set
forth in this Agreement, the non-breaching party  shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or  restrain

prevent or restrain breaches or  threatened breaches of this Agreement by
such party (or  parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions  of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of,  or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of  such
party (or parties) under this Agreement.

ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON  CONTRACT, TORT OR

and warranties (or  covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the
face of  such disclosure.
