in any event, so as to provide sufficient notice such that any required
responses from any lease or contract counterparties is due prior to the
scheduled date of the Auction as specified in the bidding procedures attached
to the Bidding Procedures Order),Sellers shall provide written notice, in
substantially the form attached as an exhibit to the proposed form of Bidding
Procedures Order attached to the motion seeking approval of the Bidding
Procedures Order, to each of the counterparties to the Assumed Real
Property Leases or Assumed Contracts listed on the Assumed Contracts
Schedule.

  



  

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Buyer may elect, in its sole and
absolute discretion, to exclude any contract or lease on the
Assumed Contracts Schedule as an Assumed Contract or as an Assumed Real
Property Lease (in which case it shall automatically become an Excluded
Contract or Excluded Real Property Lease, as applicable) by providing to
Sellers written notice of their election to exclude such contract or lease.

  



  

(c) If a counterparty to a contract or lease set forth on the Assumed
Contracts Schedule timely objects to the assumption or assignment or the
amount of the Cure Costs payable with respect to such contract or lease, as
applicable, Sellers shall request that the Bankruptcy Court hear and
determine such objection on an expedited basis. If such objection has not been
resolved prior to the Closing (whether by an order of the Bankruptcy Court or
by agreement with the contract or lease counterparty), Buyer may elect, in its
sole and absolute discretion, one of the following options: (i) treat such
contract as an Excluded Contract or Excluded Real Property Lease, as
applicable, or (ii) if such Assumed Contract or Assumed Real Property Lease is
a Required Contract or Lease, defer the Closing to such later date as Buyer
and the Sellers mutually agree for the resolution of such objection (by order
of the Bankruptcy Court or by agreement of Buyer

  



  

  



    

25

 



    

and the contract or lease counterparty), or (iii) temporarily treat the
contract or lease as an Excluded Contract or Excluded Real Property Lease, as
applicable (a "Designated Agreement"), proceed to Closing with respect to all
other Purchased Assets, and determine whether to treat the Designated
Agreement as an Assumed Contract or Assumed Real Property Lease, as
applicable, or an Excluded Contract or Excluded Real Property Lease, as
applicable, within five Business Days after resolution of such objection
(whether by an order of the Bankruptcy Court or by agreement of Buyer and the
contract or lease counterparty).

  



  

(d) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, prior to Closing,
Sellers shall not assume, reject, or alter any contract, lease or other
agreement unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Buyer.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Sellers or
Buyer identify during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Cases any lease or
contract that is not on the Assumed Contracts Schedule or Excluded Contracts
Schedule, and such contract or lease has not been rejected by Sellers, Buyer
may in its sole and absolute discretion elect by written notice to Sellers to
treat such contract or lease as an Assumed Contract or Assumed Real Property
Lease, and Sellers shall seek to assume and assign such Assumed Contract or
Assumed Real Property Lease (subject to any applicable notice requirements
under the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale Order. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event that Sellers identify any lease or contract not on the
Assumed Contracts Schedule or Excluded Contracts Schedule in accordance with
this Section 2.05(e), Sellers shall promptly provide written notice to Buyer
with respect to such lease or contract. The covenants set forth in this
Section 2.05(e) shall survive Closing.

  



  

Section 2.06. _Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price._

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but not later than 60
days, the Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a statement (the
"Allocation Statement"), allocating the Purchase Price (plus Assumed
Liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of
the Code) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (and any similar provision
of state, local or non-U.S. law, as appropriate), as of the Closing Date. The
Allocation Statement shall be considered final and binding on the parties
unless if within 30 days after the delivery of the Allocation
Statement Parent Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Sellers object to the
allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Sellers and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within 15 days. In the
event that the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within 15 days, the
parties shall jointly retain one of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst and Young or
Deloitte (the "Accounting Referee") to resolve the disputed items. The
parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting
Referee to render its decision as promptly as practicable, including by
promptly complying with all reasonable requests by the Accounting Referee for
information, books, records and similar items. Upon

  



  

  



    

26

 



    

resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the Allocation
Statement shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Sellers.

  



  

(c) The parties agree to be bound by the Allocation Statement and to act in
accordance with the Allocation Statement in the preparation, filing and audit
of any Tax return, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law or a Taxing
Authority.

Buyer, on the other, shall become aware that any of them have received or
otherwise possesses any asset that belongs to another party pursuant to this
Agreement, such party shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred,
such asset to the party so entitled thereto. Prior to any such transfer, the
party receiving or possessing such asset shall hold such asset in trust for

amount of $2,000,000 (the "Good Faith Deposit") pursuant to an escrow
agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") and the Bidding Procedures. The Good Faith
Deposit and any interest credited thereon to the Closing Date shall be
credited against the Purchase Price. If this Agreement is terminated by
Sellers pursuant to Section 11.01(c) (due to a breach by Buyer that
would cause the condition set forth in Section 10.03(a) not to be satisfied),
Sellers shall have the right to retain the Good Faith Deposit and interest
credited thereon as liquidated damages in lieu of any other remedy of Sellers
against Buyer hereunder, including, inter alia, pursuant to Section 11.02(a).
If this Agreement is terminated for any other reason, the Good Faith Deposit
and interest credited thereon shall be returned to Buyer by the Escrow Agent
within three Business Days.

ARTICLE 3

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS

  



  

Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, each Seller represents
and warrants to Buyer as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date that:

  



  

Section 3.01. _Corporate Existence and Power_. Each Seller and each of its
Subsidiaries (and each of Solazyme Bunge and its Subsidiaries) is a
corporation or other entity duly incorporated or formed, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and,
subject to any applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the authority
of the Bankruptcy Court, has all corporate or other powers to carry on the
operation of the Business (or in the case of Solazyme Bunge and its
Subsidiaries, its business) as currently conducted. Each Seller and each of
its Subsidiaries (and each of Solazyme Bunge and its Subsidiaries) has the
power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to conduct
its business as it is now being conducted. Each Seller and each of its
Subsidiaries (and each of Solazyme Bunge and its Subsidiaries) is duly
licensed or qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation or other
organization in all jurisdictions in which its ownership of properties or
assets or the character of its activities is such as to require it to be so
licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified, individually or in the aggregate, has not been and would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Sellers
have made available to the Buyer true, correct and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other organizational documents of
each Seller and each of its Subsidiaries, each as in effect on the date
hereof.

  



  

Section 3.02. _Corporate Authorization and Enforceability_. The execution,
delivery and, subject to the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order (in the
case of Section 11.02(b) hereof) and the Sale Order (in the case of all other
provisions), the performance by each Seller of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby are within such Seller's corporate or other powers and
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
such Seller. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each
Seller and, assuming the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the other
parties hereto, and subject to the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order (in
the case of Section 11.02(b)

  



  

  



    

29

 



    

hereof) and the Sale Order (in the case of all other provisions with respect
to actions to be taken following the Petition Date that require approval
pursuant to the Sale Order to be effective), constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of such Seller, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with
its terms. When each Ancillary Agreement to which a Seller is or will be a
party has been duly executed and delivered by such Seller, such
Ancillary Agreement will, assuming the execution and delivery of such
Ancillary Agreement by the other parties thereto, and subject to the entry of
the Bidding Procedures Order (in the case of Section 11.02(b) hereof) and the
Sale Order (in the case of all other provisions with respect to actions to be
taken following the Petition Date that require approval pursuant to the Sale
Order to be effective), constitute a valid and binding agreement of such
Seller, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its terms.

  



  

Section 3.03. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by each Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby require
no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority other than (i) the Bankruptcy Court, (ii) applicable requirements
of CADE and (iii) any such action or filing as to which the failure to take
or make would not be material to the Business or the Purchased Assets.

  



  

Section 3.04. _Noncontravention_. Subject to the entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order (in the case of Section 11.02(b) hereof) and the Sale Order
(in the case of all other provisions with respect to actions to be taken
following the Petition Date that require approval pursuant to the Sale Order
to be effective), the execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (a) violate
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents
of such Seller, (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 3.03, violate any Applicable Law, (c) assuming that all Required
Consents are obtained, constitute a default under or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation
or to a loss of any benefit Related to the Business or with respect to any
Purchased Asset to which such Seller is entitled under any provision of any
agreement or other instrument, except, with respect to this sub-clause (c)
only, any such as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any material
Lien or Claim on any Purchased Asset, with or without notice or lapse of time
or both.

  



  

Section 3.05. _Financial Statements_. The Financial Statements fairly present
in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated
financial position of the Parent Seller and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case of any unaudited interim
financial statements). The accounting controls of the Parent Seller and each
of its consolidated Subsidiaries have been and are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that (i) all transactions are executed in accordance
with management's general or specific

  



  

  



    

30

 



    

authorization and (ii) all transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
the accurate preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

Section 3.06. _Absence of Certain Changes._

Bankruptcy Cases and taking into account business exigencies arising as a
result of the Sellers' financial condition and status as chapter 11 debtors

course of business consistent with past practices and there has not been any
event, occurrence, development or state of circumstances or facts that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any action taken by any
Seller or any Subsidiary of any Seller that, if taken during the period from
the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date without Buyer's
consent, would constitute a breach of Section 5.02(1).

  



  

(c) Since the Balance Sheet Date, to the Knowledge of Sellers, there
has not been any action taken by Solazyme Bunge or any of its
Subsidiaries that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date without Buyer's consent, would constitute a breach
of 0.

  



  

Section 3.07. _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. There are no liabilities
of the Business of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent,
absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, and there is no existing
condition, situation or set of circumstances that could reasonably be
expected to result in such a liability, other than:

in the notes

   | (b)| Permitted Liens;

and Representatives) and (ii) the bidding procedures contained in the Bidding
Procedures Order may be supplemented by other customary procedures not
inconsistent with the matters otherwise set forth therein and the terms of
this Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent with the matters otherwise
set forth in the bidding procedures contained in the Bidding Procedures Order
and the terms of this Agreement, as may be approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
In connection with the actions permitted pursuant to this Section 7.06(b),
the Sellers may supply information Related to the Business and the Purchased
Assets to prospective bidders. In the event that the Sellers, their
Affiliates or Representatives provide or make available to any prospective
bidders any non-public information not previously provided or made available
to Buyer and its agents and Representatives, or non-public information in a
form not previously provided or made available to Buyer and its agents and
Representatives, the Sellers shall, in each case, promptly (but in no event
later than one Business Day after receipt) immediately post all such non-
public information to Sellers' online data room or otherwise make such
information available to Buyer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, neither the Sellers nor their Affiliates or Representatives shall
disclose to any third person any work product of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, including without limitation any business plan of the Buyer.

  



  

(c) If this Agreement and the sale of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer
on the terms and conditions hereof are determined to be the "highest or
otherwise best offer" in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order, the
parties agree to use reasonable efforts to cause the Bankruptcy Court to
enter an order approving such sale substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit D (it being understood and agreed that the form of Sale Order
attached hereto in Exhibit D is acceptable to Buyer) with such changes or
modifications as may be requested by Buyer or the Sellers that are consented
to in writing by the other party, with such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (the "Sale Order").Buyer agrees
that it will promptly take all actions that are reasonably requested by the
Sellers to assist in obtaining the Bankruptcy Court's entry of the Sale Order,
including furnishing affidavits, financial information or other documents or
information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court and making Buyer's
Representatives available to testify before the Bankruptcy Court.

  



  

(d) If the Sale Order or any other Orders of the Bankruptcy Court
relating to this Agreement shall be appealed by any Person (or a petition for
certiorari or motion for reconsideration, amendment, clarification,
modification, vacation, stay, rehearing or reargument shall be filed with
respect to any such Order), the Sellers shall consult with Buyer regarding the
status of any such actions and, at Buyer's reasonable request, diligently
defend against such appeal, petition or motion and use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain an expedited resolution of any such appeal, petition or
motion.

  



  

(e) The Sellers shall consult with Buyer and its representatives
concerning the Sale Order, and, upon request, provide Buyer with copies of
requested applications, pleadings, notices, proposed orders and other
documents relating to such proceedings as soon as reasonably practicable
prior to any submission thereof to the Bankruptcy Court.

  



  

  



    

55

 



    

(f) The Sellers covenant and agree that if the Sale Order is entered,
the terms of any plan submitted by the Sellers to the Bankruptcy Court for
confirmation shall not conflict with, supersede, abrogate, nullify, modify or
restrict the terms of this Agreement and the rights of Buyer hereunder, or in
any way prevent or interfere with the consummation or performance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement including any transaction that is
contemplated by or approved pursuant to the Sale Order.

  



  

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall
restrict any Seller or any of its Affiliates from selling, disposing of or
otherwise transferring any Excluded Assets or from settling, delegating or
otherwise transferring any Excluded Liabilities, or from entering into
discussions or agreements with respect to the foregoing.

  



  

Section 7.07. _Access._

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing until the third (3rd) anniversary
thereof, Buyer shall provide the Sellers and their representatives
with reasonable access, in connection with any matter relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than in
connection with any action or threatened action involving Buyer or any of its
Affiliates) during normal business hours upon reasonable notice, to all of
the Transferred Books and Records of the Business pertaining or relating to
any period prior to the Closing Date, including accounting and Tax records,
sales and purchase documents, notes, memoranda, test records and any other
electronic or written data. Nothing contained in this Section 7.07(a) shall
require the Buyer to disclose or deliver any information or documents to any
Seller, the disclosure or delivery of which, in the Buyer's good faith, would
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or work product
doctrine or contravene any Applicable Laws (including privacy Laws).

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, the Sellers shall provide Buyer and its
representatives with reasonable access, during normal business hours upon
reasonable notice, to review any documents of the Seller and their Affiliates
necessary for the Buyer to determine the scope of permitted use for any third
party Intellectual Property or Excluded Assets used in the Business (other
than in connection with any action or threatened action between a Seller or
any of its Affiliates and the Buyer or any of its Affiliates) pertaining
or relating to any period prior to the Closing Date, including accounting and
Tax records, sales and purchase documents, notes, memoranda, test records and
any other electronic or written data related to the scope of permitted use for
any third party Intellectual Property or Excluded Assets used in the
Business. Nothing contained in this Section 7.07(b) shall require a Seller to
disclose or deliver any information or documents to Buyer, the disclosure or
delivery of which, in such Seller's good faith judgment, would jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or work product doctrine or
contravene any Applicable Laws (including privacy Laws).

  



  

Section 7.08. _Release._

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, effective as of
the Closing (or the Assumption and Assignment Effective Date as applicable),
(a) each Seller (individually and on behalf of its Affiliates) hereby
releases and forever discharges Buyer

  



  

  



    

56

 



    

and its Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns and all
officers, directors, partners, members, stockholders, employees and agents of
each of them from any and all actual or potential claims, causes of action,
proceedings, liabilities, damages, expenses and/or losses of whatever kind or
nature (including attorneys' fees and costs), in law or equity, known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, now existing or hereafter arising, whether
contractual, in tort or otherwise, which such party had, has, or may have in
the future to the extent relating to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded
Liabilities, and (b) Buyer (individually and on behalf of each of its
Affiliates) hereby release and forever discharge each Seller and each of
their Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns and all officers,
directors, partners, members, stockholders, employees and agents of each of
them from any and all actual or potential claims, causes of action,
proceedings, liabilities, damages, expenses and/or losses of whatever kind or
nature (including attorneys' fees and costs), in law or equity, known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, now existing or hereafter arising, whether
contractual, in tort or otherwise, which such party had, has, or may have in
the future to the extent relating to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities; provided that (y) nothing in this Section 7.08 shall constitute
a release of any Person arising from conduct of such Person that is
determined by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
constituted an Actual Fraud, and (z) nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to release any Person from any of its contractual obligations under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, including its obligations in
respect of the Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Excluded Assets and
Excluded Liabilities, as the case may be, each of which shall remain fully
effective and enforceable from and after the Closing Date (or the
Assumption and Assignment Effective Date as applicable).

  



  

Section 7.09. _Business Confidential Information._

  



  

From and after the Closing Date until the fifth (5th) anniversary thereof,
each Seller shall keep, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to keep, any confidential and proprietary
information that is Related to the Business (the "Business
Confidential Information") confidential, with at least the same degree of
care that such Seller applies to its own confidential and proprietary
information pursuant to its applicable policies and procedures in effect on
the Closing Date and shall not disclose such Business Confidential
Information to any Person; provided, however, that each such Person may
disclose such information that (a) is or becomes publicly available other
than by disclosure by such Person or any of its Affiliates, or (b) such Person
is required to disclose by Applicable Law; provided, further, that in the
case of (b), such Person will give Buyer adequate advance notice so that
Buyer may seek a protective order or take other reasonable actions to preserve
the confidentiality of such information; provided further that Sellers may
disclose such information to its officers, directors, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and agents so long as such Persons are informed by Sellers
of the confidential nature of such information and are directed by Sellers to
treat such information confidentially.

(a) The parties agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information
and assistance Related to the Business and the Purchased Assets (including
access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all
Tax Returns, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for
any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. Buyer and Sellers, as
applicable, shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes
pertaining to the Purchased Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period for a period
of at least seven years following the Closing Date. The parties shall
cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding
relating to Taxes involving the Purchased Assets or the Business.

  



  

(b) Any real property, personal property or similar ad valorem Taxes
levied with respect to the Purchased Assets or the Business for a taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (collectively, the
"Apportioned Tax Obligations") shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period based on the number of days of such
taxable period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days
of such taxable period included in the Post-Closing Tax Period. Sellers shall
be liable for the portion of such Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall be liable for the portion of such Taxes that
is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. Any prepayments by a Seller
prior to Closing relating to Apportioned Tax Obligations shall be applied to,
and reduce, the portion of the Apportioned Tax Obligation allocated to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period. If the prepayment described above shall exceed the
portion of the Apportioned Tax Obligation allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period then the excess shall be considered an overpayment subject to Section
8.01(d).

  



  

(c) All sales, use, value added, registration stamp, recording,
documentary, conveyancing, franchise, real property charges, transfer
taxes or similar fees, including any penalties and interest and related Tax

paid, and all applicable filings, reports and returns shall be filed, as
provided by Applicable Law. The paying party shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the non-paying party in accordance with Section 8.01(b) or
Section 8.01(c), as the case may be. Upon payment of any such Apportioned Tax
Obligations or Transfer Taxes, the paying party shall present a statement to
the non-paying party setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the
paying party is entitled under Section 8.01(b) or Section 8.01(c), as the
case

  



  

  



    

58

 



    

may be, together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the amount to be reimbursed or refunded. The applicable party shall
make the payment in the foregoing sentence promptly but in no event later
than five (5) days after the presentation of such statement. Any payment
not made within such time shall bear interest at the federal underpayment
rate for each day until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the party with
the primary legal obligation to pay any Apportioned Tax Obligations or
Transfer Taxes may, in its sole discretion, seek reimbursement under this
Section 8.01(d) from the non-paying party prior to such party's payment of any
such Apportioned Tax Obligations or Transfer Taxes, and the non-paying party
shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than five (5)
days after the presentation of such statement; provided, that the non-paying
party shall not be required to make such reimbursement earlier than ten (10)
days prior to the date on which such Apportioned Tax Obligations or Transfer
Taxes are due. Buyer shall promptly pay to Sellers an amount equal to any
refund or overpayment credit (including any interest paid or credited with
respect thereto) received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than a
Seller) in connection with the Purchased Assets or the Business relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, less any Taxes and applicable costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the receipt of such refund or overpayment credit

(e) Each Seller, at its own expense, shall prepare, and with the
Buyer's cooperation, timely file all Tax Returns of such Seller relating to
the Purchased Assets and the Business in respect of all taxable periods ending
on or before the Closing Date for which Tax Returns have not been filed as of
the Closing Date. Buyer shall prepare and timely file all returns with respect
to Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business for the taxable
period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date.

  



  

(f) In the event that a dispute arises between the parties as to the
amount of Taxes or any matter relating to Taxes attributable to the Business
or the Purchased Assets the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve
such dispute, and any agreed upon amount shall be paid to the appropriate
party. If such dispute is not resolved thirty (30) calendar days thereafter,
the parties shall submit the dispute to an independent accounting firm
mutually chosen by Buyer and Sellers for resolution, which resolution shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The parties will use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such accounting firm to render its
decision as promptly as practicable, including by promptly complying with all

currently subject to any grievance procedure, arbitration, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to the Business Employees or with respect to
employees of Solazyme Bunge or its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or, to

other similar agencies.

Applicable Law in any material respect pertaining to labor relations or
employment matters.

  



  

(l) During the one year period immediately preceding the date of this
Agreement, no Seller has implemented any plant closing or layoff of employees

Section 9.02. _Employees and Offers of Employment._

  



  

(a) Section 9.02(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of the names, titles, date of hire or appointment, years of service and
current base salary, commissions, bonus opportunity, accrued and unused paid
time off, wage rates or other compensation of all Business Employees. The
Sellers will update this schedule at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Sellers shall terminate all of
the Transferred Employees immediately prior to Closing and shall pay all such
employees (or applicable Governmental Authority) any amounts due to such
employees earned on or prior to the Closing Date for accrued wages, any other
benefits, employment taxes and any other claims and obligations related to
employment except as set forth below. Within fifteen (15) Business Days
following the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate
of Buyer to, offer employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer to Business
Employees selected by Buyer in its sole discretion, with such employment to
be effective on the Closing Date and contingent on Closing and with such
offers providing for (i) a base salary (or base wages) and annual cash bonus
opportunity and employee benefits (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not
include any amounts payable under any retention or severance agreement or any
equity participation plans) that are at least substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the benefits provided to such Business Employee immediately prior
to Closing (and in any event no less than 95% of the aggregate benefits
provided to such Business Employee immediately prior to Closing) and (ii) a
work location (for a period of at least 6 months) within 100 miles of such
employee's work location immediately prior to Closing (all such employees,
the "Immediate Employees"). In addition, Buyer shall, or shall cause an
Affiliate of Buyer to, offer employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer
to such number of additional Business Employees (that, collectively with the
Immediate Employees, constitutes no

  



  

  



    

62

 



    

fewer than fifty (50) Business Employees) (such additional employees, the
"Additional Employees") selected by Buyer in its sole discretion, with such
employment to be effective on the Closing Date; provided that Buyer shall not
have any obligation to extend offers to any Additional Employees in the event
Buyer has extended an offer to fifty (50) or more Immediate Employees; and
provided further that Buyer's obligation to extend offers to Business
Employees shall be reduced on a one-for-one basis if and to the extent that,
any Business Employees listed on Section 1.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule cease to be Business Employees for any reason between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date. Each such offer by Buyer to the
Additional Employees shall provide for (iii) a base salary (or base wages)
and annualized cash bonus opportunity and employee benefits that are at least
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to
similarly situated employees of Buyer and (iv) a work location (for a period
of at least 6 months) within 100 miles of such employee's work location
immediately prior to Closing. All Business Employees who accept and commence
employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates upon Closing are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "Transferred Employees." Sellers shall
provide reasonable cooperation to Buyer in relation to Buyer's offer process
and will not take, and will cause each of their Subsidiaries not to take, any
action that would impede, hinder, interfere or otherwise compete with
Buyer's effort to hire any Transferred Employees. Buyer shall not assume
responsibility for any Transferred Employee until such employee commences
employment with Buyer (or one of its Affiliates). All Business Employees who
do not become Transferred Employees and all current or former directors,
independent contractors, and all other employees of Sellers and their
Subsidiaries are referred to herein as "Excluded Employees." The parties
shall work together in good faith prior to the Closing to (i) satisfy any
notice or consultation obligations to any labor union, labor organization, or
works council that may be triggered by this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) reasonably assist the other
respective party in meeting its obligations under this Article 9.

  



  

Section 9.03. _Sellers ' Employee Benefit Plans._

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
without limiting the generality of Section 2.04, Sellers and their ERISA
Affiliates shall remain and be responsible for any and all liabilities or
obligations or claims in respect of (i) all Transferred Employees and their
beneficiaries and dependents arising on or before the Closing Date, (ii) all
Employee Benefit Plans, whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date
and (iii) all Excluded Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents,
whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing or Section 2.04 and except as otherwise expressly
set forth herein, Sellers and their ERISA Affiliates shall remain solely
responsible for (i) all liabilities or obligations or claims arising out of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, change of control, sale bonus, stay bonus, retention bonus,
severance and similar obligations under any Employee Benefit Plan maintained,
entered into, or contributed to by Seller or its Subsidiaries and (ii) any
and all liabilities, obligations or claims described in Section 4980B of the
Code (or similar state law) that, in all cases, are or may become payable
prior to or in connection with the consummation

  



  

  



    

63

 



    

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Buyer nor any of their
Affiliates shall have any liability with respect to any of the foregoing.

(b) Buyer shall be responsible, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Buyer Benefit Plans, for any and all benefits accrued or
claims incurred by the Transferred Employees (and their eligible spouses,
beneficiaries and dependents) on and after the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Buyer will, using commercially reasonable efforts, waive, or cause
to be waived, any pre-existing medical condition or other restriction that
would prevent immediate and full participation of any Transferred Employee in
the Buyer Benefit Plans. In addition, where the benefits provided under a
Buyer Benefit Plan are subject to a deductible in respect of the benefits
provided to an individual during a certain period of time, Buyer shall, using
commercially reasonable efforts, take into account the amount of any
corresponding deductible that has already been paid by the applicable
Transferred Employee during such period and prior to the Closing Date
under the corresponding Employee Benefit Plan to the same extent as such
amounts had been recognized under such plan, for the purpose of determining
the amount of the deductible to be paid by the Transferred Employee under the
Buyer Benefit Plan after the Closing Date.

  



  

(d) Pursuant to the "Standard Procedure" provided in section 4 of
Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-34 I.R.B. 320, (i) the parties shall report
on a predecessor/successor basis as set forth therein, (ii) Sellers and their
Subsidiaries will not be relieved from filing a W-2 with respect to any
Business Employees including the Transferred Employees, and (iii) Buyer will
undertake to file (or cause to be filed) a Form W-2 for each Transferred
Employee with respect to the portion of the year during which such
Transferred Employee is employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates that
includes the Closing Date, excluding the portion of such year that such
Transferred Employee was employed by the Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law and contract, the Sellers
and their Subsidiaries shall provide Buyer with certain relevant information,
as reasonably requested by Buyer, with respect to the Transferred Employees to
assist in effecting their employment by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
following the Closing Date in an orderly fashion.

  



  

Section 9.05. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Article
shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or
former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the
Sellers or of any of their Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment) with Buyer or

  



  

  



    

64

 



    

any of its Affiliates and no provision of this Article 9 shall create any
such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be
provided, directly or indirectly, under any Employee Benefit Plan or any plan
or arrangement that may be established by Buyer or any of its Affiliates. No

Buyer is in any non-de minimis breach of this Agreement, including its
obligation to consummate the Closing on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;

  



  

(c) by Parent Seller if (i) a breach of any representation or warranty

incapable of being cured or, if curable, is not cured by Buyer by the earlier
of (A) within 10 calendar days after the giving of written notice of such

that at the time of such termination, no Seller shall be in material breach
of its obligations under this Agreement;

  



  

(d) by Buyer if (i) a breach of any representation or warranty or

satisfied and (ii) such condition is incapable of being cured or, if curable,
is not cured by the Sellers by the earlier of (A) within 10 calendar days

the rights of Buyer hereunder, or in any way seeks to prevent or interfere
with the consummation or performance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any of the
foregoing sections other than Section 11.01(b), shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

  



  

Section 11.02. _Effect of Termination; Break-Up Fee_. (a) If this Agreement
is

  



  

terminated as permitted by Section 11.01, such termination shall be without
liability of either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this
Agreement; provided that if such termination results from the willful (i)
failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the
obligations of the other party, (ii) failure to perform a covenant of this
Agreement or (iii) breach by any party hereto of any representation or
warranty or agreement contained herein, such party shall be liable for any
and all damages, losses and expenses (including reasonable expenses of
investigation and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred or
suffered by the parties on the other side of the transaction (i.e., Sellers or
Buyer as applicable) as a result of such failure or breach, up to a maximum
amount of (x) $2,000,000, in the case of Buyer, and (y) $800,000, in the
case of the

  



  

Sellers. The provisions of Sections 6.01, 12.01, 12.02, 12.05, 12.06, 12.07,
12.11, 12.13 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 11.01.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the remedies, if any, available under Section
11.02(a) (under the circumstances contemplated by 11.02(a)), if this
Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Sections 11.01(b), 11.01(d),
11.01(e), 11.01(g), or 11.01(h) or terminated automatically pursuant to
Section 11.01(f), Sellers shall pay to Buyer the Expense Reimbursement Amount
by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three Business Days
after termination of the Agreement.

  



  

(c) In addition to the Expense Reimbursement, upon this Agreement being
terminated pursuant to (i) Section 11.01(d) (but only if the breach is
willful and provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that a failure to fulfil the
conditions under Section 10.02(e), (f), Error! Reference source not found. -
(l) shall not be considered a willful breach), (ii) Section 11.01(e),
(iii) Section 11.01(f), (iv) Section 11.01(g) (but only in the event the
Bankruptcy Cases are dismissed) or (v) Section 11.01(h), then the Sellers
shall pay to Buyer the Break-Up Fee. The Break-Up Fee shall be paid to Buyer,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, (x) concurrently with the
consummation of the applicable Alternative Transaction (in the event of
termination under Sections 11.01(e) or 11.01(f)) or (y) within three Business
Days after termination under

  



  

  



    

69

 



    

Sections 11.01(d), 11.01(g), or 11.01(h). In no event shall the Break-Up Fee
be payable if this Agreement is terminated for any other reason.

  



  

(d) The parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledge that: (i) each of
the Expense Reimbursement Amount and the Break Up Fee are intended to
constitute an administrative expense of the Sellers with priority over any and
all administrative expenses of the kind specified in Section 503(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code until paid, notwithstanding Section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code, (ii) the approval of the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement
Amount is an integral part of the transactions contemplated herein, (iii) in
the absence of the Sellers' obligation to pay the Break-Up Fee and the
Expense Reimbursement Amount, Buyer would not have entered into this
Agreement, (iv) the entry by Buyer into this Agreement is necessary for the
preservation of each of the Seller's estates and is beneficial to the Sellers
because, in the business judgment of each of the Sellers, it will enhance such
Seller's ability to maximize the value of its assets for the benefit of its
creditors, and (v) the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Amount are
reasonable in relation to Buyer's efforts and to the magnitude of the
transactions contemplated herein and the Buyer's lost opportunities resulting
from the time spent pursuing such transactions.

  



  

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that upon any termination
of this Agreement under circumstances where the Break-Up Fee and/or Expense
Reimbursement Amount is payable by Sellers pursuant to this Section 11.02 and
such amount is paid in full, Buyer shall be precluded from any other remedy
against Sellers, at law or in equity or otherwise, and Buyer shall not seek to
obtain any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect or punitive damages, against Sellers or any of their
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, stockholders or
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives in connection with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. In no event shall Sellers be required to pay more than one Break-Up
Fee and Expense Reimbursement Amount pursuant to this Agreement.
