stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub that was outstanding prior to
the Marine Merger Effective Time shall not be converted or otherwise effected

Consideration"). As of the Pride Merger Effective Time, all such shares of
Pride Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or certificates or rights thereto that immediately prior to
the Pride Merger Effective Time which represent outstanding shares of Pride
Common Stock (the "Pride Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive certificates ("Company
Certificates") representing the number of shares of Company Common stock into
which such shares have been converted.   Section 4.5 Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Closing Date, the Company
shall enter into an agreement with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company
(the "Exchange Agent"), which shall provide that the Company shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Marine Common
Stock and Pride Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article 4,
through the Exchange Agent, Company Certificates representing the number of
shares of Company Common Stock (such shares of Company Common Stock, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto with a record date
after the Pride Merger Effective Time being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to this Article 4.   (b) Exchange
Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Pride Merger
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Marine Certificate or a Pride Certificate (each a "Certificate"
and collectively the "Certificates") whose shares were converted pursuant to
Section 4.1(b) and/or Section 4.4(b), (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Marine and Pride may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration
set forth in Article 4. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a Company     7  17  Certificate representing that number of
shares of Company Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 4, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Marine Common Stock not registered in the transfer records of
Marine or of Pride Common Stock not registered in the transfer records of
Pride, a Company Certificate representing the proper number of shares of
Company Common Stock may be issued to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other non-
income taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Company Common
Stock to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid or
is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.5,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Pride Merger Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender Company
Certificates representing the number of shares of Company Common Stock into
which the shares of Pride Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate (including shares of Pride Common Stock issuable in respect of
Marine Common Stock as a result of the Marine Merger) have been converted. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article 4.   (c)
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Company Common Stock with a record date after
the Pride Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock represented thereby and all such dividends and other distributions
shall be paid by the Company to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in
the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this Article 4. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat
or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be
paid to the holder of the Company Certificate representing shares of Company
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time
of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Pride Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Pride Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender and
with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall make available to the
Exchange Agent cash for these purposes.   (d) No Further Ownership Rights in
Marine Common Stock and Pride Common Stock. All shares of Company Common
Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance
with the terms of this Article 4 (including any cash paid pursuant to this
Article 4) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Pride Common Stock
(including shares of Pride Common Stock issuable in respect of Marine Common
Stock as a result of the Marine Merger) theretofore represented by such
Certificates,     8  18  subject, however, to the Pride Merger
Surviving Entity\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Pride Merger Effective Time
which may have been authorized or made by Marine on such shares of Marine
Common Stock or by Pride on such shares of Pride Common Stock, as the case
may be, which remain unpaid at the Pride Merger Effective Time.   (e)
Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the
Pride Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company upon demand,
and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with
this Article 4 shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment of their
claim for Pride Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Company Common Stock.   (f) No Liability. None of the Company,
Marine, Pride, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person
in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund in each
case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to seven years after the Pride Merger Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Pride Merger
Consideration, any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to
this Article 4 or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of
such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental body or authority), any Pride Merger Consideration,
cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Company, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.   (g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Company, on
a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to the Company; provided, however, that no such investment or
loss shall affect the amounts payable to any holder of a Certificate.   (h)
Exchanges by Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Company Common Stock and Company Certificates therefor issued
to affiliates of Marine as a result of the Mergers shall be subject to the
restrictions on transfer described in Section 7.13 and Exhibits 7.13(a) and
7.13(b)(1), and such shares shall bear restrictive legends as described in
Exhibit 7.13(a)(1). Any Company Common Stock and Certificates therefor issued
to affiliates of Pride as a result of the Pride Merger shall be subject to
the restrictions on transfer described in Section 7.13(b) and
Exhibit 7.13(b)(2).     9  19   (i) Lost Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Company, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Company may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Pride Merger Consideration and, if applicable,
any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Company Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.   Section 4.6
Rule 16b-3 Approval. Each of the Company, Marine, Merger Sub and Pride agree
that their respective board of directors or the executive compensation
committee of their board of directors shall, at or prior to the Marine Merger
Effective Time, adopt resolutions specifically approving, for purposes of
Rule 16b-3 ("Rule 16b-3") of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), the receipt, pursuant to this Agreement, of Company
Common Stock and of options to acquire Company Common Stock, by executive
officers or directors of each of Marine and Pride who become
executive officers or directors of the Company subject to Rule 16b-3.  
ARTICLE 5   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MARINE   Except as set forth
in the disclosure letter delivered to Pride by Marine at or prior to the
execution hereof (the "Marine Disclosure Letter"), Marine represents and
warrants to Pride and the Company the following:   Section 5.1 Existence;
Good Standing; Corporate Authority. Marine is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Texas.
Marine is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept or
similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing
under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business
makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified does not and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section
10.9(c)). Marine has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted. The copies of Marine\'s restated articles of incorporation and
bylaws previously made available to Pride are true and correct and contain
all amendments as of the date hereof.   Section 5.2 Authorization, Validity
and Effect of Agreements. Marine has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Pride Stock     10 
20  Option Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated
hereby and thereby to which it is a party. The consummation by Marine of the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Pride Stock Option Agreement have
been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on behalf of Marine,
other than the approvals referred to in Section 5.19. This Agreement and the
Pride Stock Option Agreement constitute valid and legally binding obligations
of Marine, enforceable against Marine in accordance with their respective
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors\' rights and general
principles of equity. Marine has taken all action necessary to render the
restrictions set forth in Part 13 of the TBCA inapplicable to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. No other state takeover or business
combination statute applies to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Pride Stock Option Agreement.   Section 5.3 Capitalization.
As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Marine
consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, and
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, of which
200,000 shares have been designated Junior Participating Preferred Stock
("Junior Preferred Stock"). As of May 18, 2001, 58,697,281 shares of Marine
Common Stock and no shares of Junior Preferred Stock were outstanding. At the
same date, there were 3,576,359 shares of Marine Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon exercise of outstanding Marine Stock Options (as defined in
Section 7.16). All such issued and outstanding shares of Marine Common Stock
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. One right to purchase Junior Preferred Stock (each,
a "Marine Right") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of
November 15, 1996, (the "Marine Rights Agreement"), as amended, between
Marine and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company is associated with and
attached to each outstanding share of Marine Common Stock. As of the date of
this Agreement, except for the Pride Stock Option Agreement, the Marine
Rights and as set forth in this Section 5.3, there are no outstanding shares
of capital stock and there are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions,
convertible securities or other rights, agreements or commitments which
obligate Marine or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Marine or any of its
Subsidiaries. Marine has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the shareholders of Marine on any matter.   Section 5.4 Significant
Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, "Significant Subsidiary" shall
mean significant subsidiary as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the
SEC under the Exchange Act. Each of Marine\'s Significant Subsidiaries is a
corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, has the corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and
is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (where applicable)
in each jurisdiction in which the ownership,     11  21  operation or
lease of its property or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so
qualified or to be in good standing does not and is not reasonably likely to
have a Marine Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, all
of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests
in, each of Marine\'s Significant Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned, directly or indirectly,
by Marine free and clear of all mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security
interests, pledges, leases, conditional sale contracts, charges, privileges,
easements, rights of way, reservations, options, rights of first refusal and
other encumbrances ("Liens").   Section 5.5 Compliance with Laws; Permits.
Except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, do not or are
not reasonably likely to have a Marine Material Adverse Effect and except for
matters arising under Environmental Laws which are treated exclusively in
Section 5.13:   (a) Neither Marine nor any Subsidiary of Marine is in
violation of any applicable law, rule, regulation, code, governmental
determination, order, treaty, convention, governmental certification
requirement or other public limitation, U.S. or non-U.S. (collectively, the
"Marine Applicable Laws"), relating to the ownership or operation of any of
their respective assets, and no claim is pending or, to the knowledge of
Marine, threatened with respect to any such matters. No condition exists that
is not disclosed in the Marine Disclosure Letter and which does or is
reasonably likely to constitute a violation of or deficiency under any Marine
Applicable Law relating to the ownership or operation of the assets of Marine
or any Subsidiary of Marine.   (b) Marine and each Subsidiary of Marine hold
all permits, licenses, certifications, variations, exemptions, orders,
franchises and approvals of all governmental or regulatory authorities
necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses (the "Marine
Permits"). All Marine Permits are in full force and effect and there exists
no default thereunder or breach thereof, and Marine has no notice or actual
knowledge that such Marine Permits will not be renewed in the ordinary course
after the Marine Merger Effective Time. No governmental authority has given,
or to the knowledge of Marine threatened to give, any action to terminate,
cancel or reform any Marine Permit.   (c) Each drilling rig or other
drilling unit owned by Marine or a subsidiary of Marine which is subject to
classification is in class according to the rules and regulations of the
applicable classifying body and is duly and lawfully documented under the
laws of its flag jurisdiction.   (d) Marine and each Subsidiary of Marine
possess all permits, licenses, operating authorities, orders, exemptions,
franchises, variances, consents, approvals or other authorizations required
for the present ownership and operation of all its real property or
leaseholds ("Marine Real Property") except where the failure to possess any
of the same does not and is not reasonably likely     12  22  to have
a Marine Material Adverse Effect. There exists no material default or breach
with respect to, and no party or governmental authority has taken or, to the
knowledge of Marine, threatened to take, any action to terminate, cancel
or reform any such permit, license, operating authority, order,
exemption, franchise, variance, consent, approval or other authorization
pertaining to Marine Real Property.   Section 5.6 No Conflict. (a) Neither
the execution and delivery by Marine of this Agreement, the Pride Stock
Option Agreement nor the consummation by Marine of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby in accordance with their respective terms will
(i) subject to the approvals referred to in Section 5.19, conflict with or
result in a breach of any provisions of the restated articles of
incorporation or bylaws of Marine, (ii) violate, or conflict with, or result
in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or
result in the termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or
give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties
of Marine or its Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared void,
voidable, or without further binding effect, or otherwise result in a
detriment to Marine or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed
of trust, license, franchise, permit, lease, contract, agreement, joint
venture or other instrument or obligation to which Marine or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Marine or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their properties is bound or affected or (iii) subject to the filings and
other matters referred to in Section 5.6(c), contravene or conflict with or
constitute a violation of any provision of any law, rule, regulation,
judgment, order or decree binding upon or applicable to Marine or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for such matters described in clause (ii) or (iii) as do
not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Marine Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Neither the execution and delivery
by Marine of this Agreement, the Pride Stock Option Agreement nor the
consummation by Marine of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby in
accordance with their respective terms will result in any "change of control"
or similar event or circumstance under the terms of any Marine Material
Contract or under any contract or plan under which any officers or directors
of Marine or any of its Subsidiaries are entitled to payments or benefits,
which gives rise to rights or benefits not otherwise available absent such
change of control or similar event.   (c) Neither the execution and delivery
by Marine of this Agreement, the Pride Stock Option Agreement nor the
consummation by Marine of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby in
accordance with their respective terms will require any consent, approval or
authorization of, or filing or registration with, any governmental or
regulatory authority, other than (i) the filing of the Marine Certificate of
Merger, (ii) the filing of the Texas Articles of Merger, (iii) filings
required under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as     13  23  amended (the "HSR Act"), the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or applicable
state securities and "Blue Sky" laws, applicable non-U.S. competition,
antitrust or premerger notification laws, and (iv) the filing of a listing
application with the NYSE with respect to any Marine Common Stock issued upon
exercise of the Pride Stock Option ((i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) collectively,
the "Marine Regulatory Filings"), except for any consent, approval or
authorization the failure of which to obtain and for any filing or
registration the failure of which to make does not and is not reasonably
likely to have a Marine Material Adverse Effect or substantially impair or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section
5.7 SEC Documents. Marine has timely filed with the SEC all documents
required to be so filed by it in the preceding twelve months pursuant to
Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Marine and
its Subsidiaries have filed with the SEC all documents required to be so
filed by them in the preceding three fiscal years and during 2001 pursuant to
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act without regard to Rule 12b-25. Marine has
made available to Pride each registration statement, report, proxy statement
or information statement (other than preliminary materials) it has so filed,
each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with
the SEC (collectively, the "Marine Reports"). As of its respective date, each
Marine Report (i) complied in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading except for such statements, if any, as
have been modified by subsequent filings with the SEC prior to the date
hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated
by reference into Marine Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of Marine and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders\' equity
included in or incorporated by reference into Marine Reports (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the
results of operations, cash flows or changes in shareholders\' equity, as the
case may be, of Marine and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as may
be permitted by Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X of the SEC and (y) normal year-
end audit adjustments), in each case in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied during the periods involved,
except as may be noted therein. Except as and to the extent set forth on the
most recent consolidated balance sheet of Marine and its Subsidiaries
included in Marine Reports, including all notes thereto, as of the date of
such balance sheet, neither Marine nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on, or
reserved against in, a balance sheet of Marine or in the notes thereto
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied, other than liabilities or obligations which do not and
are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Marine
Material Adverse Effect.     14  24   Section 5.8 Litigation. Except as
would not have a Marine Material Adverse Effect, Section 5.8 of the Marine
Disclosure Letter contains an accurate summary of each litigation matter
pending or threatened against Marine or any of its Subsidiaries that is not
summarized in the Marine Reports. Except as described in Marine Reports filed
on or prior to the date of this Agreement, there are no actions, suits or
proceedings pending against Marine or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
Marine\'s knowledge, threatened against Marine or any of its Subsidiaries, at
law or in equity, before or by any U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. court,
commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, that are reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 5.9 Absence of Certain Changes. From December 31, 2000 to
the date of this Agreement, there has not been (i) any event or
occurrence that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Marine Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) any material change by Marine or any of its
Subsidiaries, when taken as a whole, in any of its accounting methods,
principles or practices or any of its tax methods, practices or elections,
(iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
distribution in respect of any capital stock of Marine or any redemption,
purchase or other acquisition of any of its securities or (iv) any increase
in or establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance, deferred
compensation, pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock option,
stock purchase or other employee benefit plan, except in the ordinary course
of business.    Section 5.10 Taxes. Except for such matters as,
individually or in the aggregate, do not or are not reasonably likely to have
a Marine Material Adverse Effect, and except as disclosed in the Marine
Disclosure Letter (it being understood that inclusion of a matter in the
Marine Disclosure Letter does not necessarily mean that such matter is or is
reasonably likely to have a Marine Material Adverse Effect):   (a) Each of
Marine and its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax Returns that it was required to
file. All such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all respects. All
Taxes owed by any of Marine and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any

the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return.
No claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where any of
Marine and its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens on any of the
assets of any of Marine and its Subsidiaries that arose in connection with
any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax.   (b) Each of Marine and
its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, shareholder, or other third party.    
15  25   (c) No officer or employee responsible for Tax matters of any
of Marine and its Subsidiaries expects any authority to assess any additional
Taxes for any period for which Tax Returns have been filed. There is no
dispute or claim concerning any Tax liability of any of Marine and its
Subsidiaries either (i) claimed or raised by any authority in writing or (ii)
as to which any of the officers or employees responsible for Tax matters of
Marine and its Subsidiaries has knowledge based upon personal contact with
any agent of such authority. Section 5.10 of the Marine Disclosure Letter
lists all federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax Returns filed with
respect to any of Marine and its Subsidiaries for taxable periods ended on or
after December 31, 1998, indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited,
and indicates those Tax Returns that currently are the subject of audit or
have been noticed for audit.   (d) None of Marine and its Subsidiaries has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.   (e)
None of Marine and its Subsidiaries has filed a consent under Code Section
341(f) concerning collapsible corporations.   (f) A valid and timely Code

1985 by Marine or any of its Subsidiaries and for which such an election was
permissible.   (g) None of Marine and its Subsidiaries are parties to a
gain recognition agreement under U.S. Treasury Reg. Section 1.367(a)-8.

common parent of which was Marine) since January 1, 1987, or (ii) has any
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than any of Marine and
its Subsidiaries) under U.S. Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise.   (n) Section 5.10(n) of the Marine Disclosure
Letter sets forth the following information with respect to each of Marine
and its Subsidiaries as of the most recent practicable date (as well as on an
estimated pro forma basis as of the Closing giving effect to the consummation

forth on the face of such most recent balance sheet (rather than in any notes
thereto) and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of
time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice
of Marine and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns.   (p) Neither
Marine nor any of the Marine Subsidiaries knows of any fact, or has taken any

Stock solely for Pride Common Stock pursuant to the Marine Merger to
recognize taxable gain with respect to the Marine Merger, (iii) cause the

a consequence of the Mergers. Neither Pride nor any of its Subsidiaries has
agreed to pay, or will pay, directly or indirectly, any consideration for
Marine Common Stock other than Pride Common Stock. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to pay, or will pay, directly or
indirectly, any consideration other than Company Common Stock for Pride
Common Stock, including that issued in the Marine Merger.   (q) For

applicable final and binding orders of any court, governmental authority or

aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect. There are no past or present
facts, conditions or circumstances that interfere with the conduct of any of
their respective businesses in the manner now conducted or which interfere
with continued compliance with any Environmental Law except for any non-
compliance or interference that is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect.   (b)
Except for such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect, no
judicial or administrative proceedings or governmental investigations are
pending or, to the knowledge of Marine, threatened against Marine or
its Subsidiaries that allege the violation of or seek to impose liability
pursuant to any Environmental Law, and there are no past or present facts,
conditions or circumstances at, on or arising out of, or otherwise associated
with, any current or, to the knowledge of Marine or its Subsidiaries, former
businesses, assets or properties of Marine or any Subsidiary of Marine,

of any material, substance or waste classified, characterized or otherwise
regulated as hazardous, toxic, pollutant, contaminant or words of similar
meaning under Environmental Laws, including petroleum or petroleum products

liabilities or obligations for any cleanup, remediation, disposal or
corrective action under any Environmental Law, (ii) claims arising for
personal injury, property damage or damage to natural resources, or (iii)
civil, criminal or administrative fines, penalties or injunctive relief.

and its Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights
to use all patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights and
proprietary information used or held for use in connection with their
respective businesses as currently being conducted, except where the failure
to own or possess such licenses and other rights does not and is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Marine
Material Adverse Effect, and there are no assertions or claims challenging
the validity of any of the foregoing that are reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of Marine, the conduct of Marine\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
respective businesses as currently conducted does not conflict with any
patents, patent rights, licenses, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names,
trade name rights or copyrights of others that are reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect. To
the knowledge of Marine, there is no material infringement of any proprietary
right owned by or licensed by or to Marine or any of its Subsidiaries that
is reasonably likely to have individually or in the aggregate, a Marine
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.15 Decrees, Etc. Except for such
matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect, (i) no order, writ, fine,

governmental authority has been issued or entered against Marine or any
Subsidiary of Marine that continues to be in effect that affects the
ownership or operation of any of their respective assets, and (ii) no
criminal order, writ, fine, injunction, decree, judgment or determination of
any court or governmental authority has been issued against Marine or any
Subsidiary of Marine.   Section 5.16 Insurance. (a) Except for such matters

aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect, Marine and its Subsidiaries
maintain insurance coverage with financially responsible insurance companies
in such amounts and against such losses as are customary in the offshore
drilling business as conducted by Marine prior to the date hereof.    
22  32   (b) Except for such matters as do not and are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Marine
Material Adverse Effect, no event relating specifically to Marine or its
Subsidiaries (as opposed to events affecting the drilling service industry in
general) has occurred that is reasonably likely, after the date of this
Agreement, to result in an upward adjustment in premiums under any insurance
policies they maintain. Excluding insurance policies that have expired and
been replaced in the ordinary course of business, no excess liability, hull
or protection and indemnity insurance policy has been canceled by the insurer
within one year prior to the date hereof, and to Marine\'s knowledge, no
threat in writing has been made to cancel (excluding cancellation upon
expiration or failure to renew) any such insurance policy of Marine or any
Subsidiary of Marine during the period of one year prior to the date hereof.
Prior to the date hereof, no event has occurred, including the failure by
Marine or any Subsidiary of Marine to give any notice or information or by
giving any inaccurate or erroneous notice or information, which
materially limits or impairs the rights of Marine or any Subsidiary of Marine
under any such excess liability, hull or protection and indemnity insurance
policies.   Section 5.17 No Brokers. Marine has not entered into
any contract, arrangement or understanding with any person or firm which may
result in the obligation of Marine, Pride or the Company to pay any finder\'s
fees, brokerage or other like payments in connection with the negotiations
leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except that Marine has retained Morgan Stanley and Co.
Incorporated as its financial advisor, the arrangements with which have been
disclosed in writing to Pride prior to the date hereof.   Section 5.18

the date of this Agreement, the Marine Merger Consideration is fair to the
shareholders of Marine from a financial point of view.   Section 5.19 Vote

capital stock necessary to approve any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement are the affirmative vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Marine
Common Stock.   Section 5.20 Ownership of Drilling Rigs. As of the date
hereof, Marine or a Subsidiary of Marine has good and indefeasible title to
the drilling rigs listed in Marine\'s most recent annual report on Form 10-K,
in each case free and clear of all Liens except for (i) defects or
irregularities of title or encumbrances of a nature that do not materially
impair the ownership or operation of these assets and which have not had and
are not reasonably likely to have a Marine Material Adverse Effect, (ii)
Liens that secure obligations not yet due and payable or, if such obligations
are due and have not been paid, Liens securing such obligations that are
being diligently contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings (any
such contests involving an amount in     23  33  excess of $5.0 million
being described in Marine Disclosure Letter), (iii) Liens for taxes,
assessments or other governmental charges or levies not yet due or which are
being contested in good faith, (iv) Liens in connection with
workmen\'s compensation, unemployment insurance or other social security, old
age pension or public liability obligations not yet due or which are being
contested in good faith, (v) operators\', vendors\', suppliers of necessaries
to Marine\'s drilling rigs, carriers\', warehousemen\'s, repairmen\'s,
mechanics\', workmen\'s, materialmen\'s, construction or shipyard liens
(during repair or upgrade periods) or other similar Liens arising by
operation of law in the ordinary course of business or statutory landlord\'s
liens, each of which is in respect of obligations that have not been
outstanding more than 90 days (so long as no action has been taken to file or
enforce such Liens within said 90-day period) or which are being contested in
good faith and (vi) other Liens disclosed in Marine Disclosure Letter (the
Liens described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi),
collectively, "Marine Permitted Liens"). No such asset is leased under an
operating lease from a lessor that, to Marine\'s knowledge, has incurred non-
recourse indebtedness to finance the acquisition or construction of
such asset.   Section 5.21 Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Marine nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether
or not fixed, accrued, contingent or otherwise, except liabilities and
obligations that (i) are disclosed in Marine Reports, (ii) are referred to in
the Marine Disclosure Letter or (iii) do not and are not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect.  
Section 5.22 Certain Contracts. (a) Section 5.22 of Marine Disclosure Letter
contains a list of all of the following contracts or agreements (other than
those listed as an exhibit to Marine\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the

S-K of the SEC) (all contracts or agreements of the types described in
clauses (i) through (vi) being referred to herein as "Marine Material
Contracts").   (b) As of the date of this Agreement, each Marine
Material Contract is, to the knowledge of Marine, in full force and effect,
and Marine and each of its Subsidiaries have in all material respects
performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date under
each     24  34  Marine Material Contract, except where such failure to
be binding or in full force and effect or such failure to perform does not
and is not reasonably likely to create, individually or in the aggregate, a
Marine Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters as do not and are not
reasonably likely to have a Marine Material Adverse Effect, neither Marine
nor any of its Subsidiaries (x) knows of, or has received written notice of,
any breach of or violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of Marine,
does there exist any condition which with the passage of time or the giving
of notice or both would result in such a violation or default under) any
Marine Material Contract or (y) has received written notice of the desire of
the other party or parties to any such Marine Material Contract to exercise
any rights such party has to cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or
exercise remedies thereunder. Each Marine Material Contract is enforceable by
Marine or a Subsidiary of Marine in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to creditors\' rights and general principles of equity,
except where such unenforceability is not reasonably likely to create,
individually or in the aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect.  
Section 5.23 Capital Expenditure Program. As of the date of this Agreement,
Section 5.23 of the Marine Disclosure Letter accurately sets forth in all
material respects, for each of Marine\'s sustaining, life extension
and newbuild capital expenditure programs, the capital expenditures for all

other improper payments have been made by Marine or any Subsidiary of Marine
or agent of any of them in connection with the conduct of their respective
businesses or the operation of their respective assets, and neither Marine,
any Subsidiary of Marine nor any agent of any of them has received any such
payments from vendors, suppliers or other persons, where any such payment
made or received is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Marine Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.25 Amendment to
Marine Rights Agreement. Marine has amended or taken other action under
Marine Rights Agreement so that none of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the execution and delivery of the Pride Stock Option Agreement,
the conversion of shares of Marine Common Stock into the right to receive
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with this Agreement, the
consummation of the Mergers, the issuance of Marine Common Stock upon
exercise of the Pride Stock Option or any other transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Pride Stock Option Agreement, will cause: (i)
the Marine Rights to become exercisable under the Marine Rights Agreement;
(ii) the Company, Pride or any of Pride\'s shareholders or Subsidiaries to be
deemed an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in Marine Rights Agreement); (iii)
any such event to be an event requiring an adjustment of the purchase price

(iv) Section 14 of the Marine Rights Agreement to be or become applicable to
any such event; or (v) a "Shares Acquisition Date" or a "Distribution Date"
(each as defined in Marine Rights Agreement) to occur upon any such event,

to the Marine Merger Effective Time. Marine has delivered to Pride a true and
complete copy of Marine Rights Agreement, as amended to date.   Section

Agreement, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken, or agreed to
take, any action or failed to take any action which action or failure
(without giving effect to any actions or failures to act by Pride or any of
its Subsidiaries) that is known to Marine as of the date of this Agreement
to prevent the treatment of the Mergers contemplated herein as (i) a pooling
of interests for accounting purposes under the requirements of Opinion No.
16 (Business Combinations) of the Accounting Principles Board of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board and the rules of the SEC, or (ii) reorganizations within the

WARRANTIES OF PRIDE   Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered
to Marine by Pride at or prior to the execution hereof (the "Pride Disclosure
Letter"), Pride represents and warrants to Marine and the Company the
following:   Section 6.1 Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority.
Pride is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Louisiana. Pride is duly qualified to do business
and, to the extent such concept or similar concept exists in the relevant
jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which
the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the
transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified does not and is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Pride Material Adverse Effect (as defined
in Section 10.9). Pride has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted. The copies of Pride\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws
previously made available to Marine are true and correct and contain all
amendments as of the date hereof.   Section 6.2 Authorization, Validity and
Effect of Agreements. Pride has the requisite corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Marine Stock Option Agreement and
all other agreements and documents contemplated hereby and thereby to which
it is a party. The consummation by Pride of the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Marine Stock Option Agreement have been duly authorized by
all requisite corporate action on behalf of Pride, other than the approvals
referred to in Section 6.19. This Agreement and the Marine Stock Option
Agreement constitute valid and legally binding obligations of Pride,
enforceable against     26  36  Pride in accordance with their
respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors\'
rights and general principles of equity. Pride has taken all action necessary
to render the restrictions set forth in R.S. 12:133 and 12:135-140.2 of the
LBCL inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
No other state takeover or business combination statute applies to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Marine Stock Option
Agreement.   Section 6.3 Capitalization. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Pride consists of 200,000,000
shares of common stock, no par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, no par value per share, of which 2,000,000 shares have been
designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred
Stock"). As of May 22, 2001, 73,597,802 shares of Pride Common Stock and no
shares of Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding. Section 6.3 of the Pride
Disclosure Letter sets forth the number of shares of Pride Common Stock
reserved for issuance as of May 18, 2001. All such issued and outstanding
shares of Pride Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. One right to purchase Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (each, a "Pride Right") issued pursuant to the
Rights Agreement, dated as of September 9, 1998 (the "Pride Rights
Agreement"), as amended, between Pride and American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company is associated with and attached to each outstanding share of Pride
Common Stock. As of the date of this Agreement, except for the Marine Stock
Option Agreement, the Pride Rights, the Put and Exchange Agreement between
Pride and First Reserve Fund VIII, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and
as set forth in this Section 6.3, there are no outstanding shares of capital
stock and there are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible
securities or other rights, agreements or commitments which obligate Pride or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of Pride or any of its Subsidiaries, except
as described in the notes to the financial statements of Pride included in
its Form 10-Q report for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 filed with the SEC.
Pride has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the
holders of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of
Pride on any matter, except as described in the notes to the financial
statements of Pride included in its Form 10-Q report for the quarter ended
March 31, 2001 filed with the SEC.   Section 6.4 Significant Subsidiaries.
Each of Pride\'s Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent such concept or
similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the
corporate or other entity power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (where applicable) in
each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or lease of its property
or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for
jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good
standing does not and     27  37  is not reasonably likely to have a
Pride Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each

hereof.   (b) Except for such matters as do not and are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Pride Material

prior to the date hereof, and to Pride\'s knowledge, no threat in writing has
been made to cancel (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to

event has occurred, including the failure by Pride or any Subsidiary of Pride

notice or information, which materially limits or impairs the rights of Pride
or any Subsidiary of Pride under any such excess liability, hull or
protection and indemnity insurance policies.   Section 6.17 No Brokers.

retained Salomon Smith Barney Inc. as its financial advisor, the arrangements

which a quorum is present.   Section 6.20 Ownership of Drilling Rigs and
Drillships. As of the date hereof, Pride or a Subsidiary of Pride has good
and indefeasible title to the drilling rigs listed in Pride\'s most recent

Section 6.22 Certain Contracts. (a) Section 6.22 of Pride Disclosure Letter

party or by which any of them is bound as of the date of this Agreement: (i)
any non-competition agreement that purports to limit the manner in which, or
the localities in which, all or any portion of their respective businesses is
conducted, other than any such limitation that is not material to Pride and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) any drilling rig construction or
conversion contract with respect to which the drilling rig has not

greater remaining duration or drilling contracts of a shorter duration which

duration of one year or more; (iv) any contract or agreement for the
borrowing of money with a borrowing capacity or outstanding indebtedness of

a "business" (as such term is defined in Article 11-01(d) of Regulation S-X
of the SEC; or (vi) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item

Agreement, each Pride Material Contract is, to the knowledge of Pride, in
full force and effect, and Pride and each of its Subsidiaries have in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by them
to date under each Pride Material Contract, except where such failure to be
binding or in full force and effect or such failure to perform does not and
is not reasonably likely to create, individually or in the aggregate, a Pride
Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters as do not and are not
reasonably likely to have a Pride Material Adverse Effect, neither Pride nor
any of its Subsidiaries (x) knows of, or has received written notice of, any
breach of or violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of Pride, does
there exist any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both would result in such a violation or default under) any Pride
Material Contract or (y) has received written notice of the desire of
the other party or parties to any such Pride Material Contract to exercise
any rights such party has to cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract
or exercise remedies thereunder. Each Pride Material Contract is enforceable
by Pride or a Subsidiary of Pride in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to creditors\' rights and general principles of equity,
except where such unenforceability is not reasonably likely to create,
individually or in the aggregate, a Pride Material Adverse Effect.  
Section 6.23 Capital Expenditure Program. As of the date of this Agreement,
Section 6.23 of the Pride Disclosure Letter accurately sets forth in all
material respects, for each of Pride\'s sustaining, life extension
and newbuild capital expenditure programs, the capital expenditures for all
such programs that were forecasted to be incurred in 2001 on an annual
basis.   Section 6.24 Improper Payments. No bribes, kickbacks or
other improper payments have been made by Pride or any Subsidiary of Pride or
agent of any of them in connection with the conduct of their respective
businesses or the operation of their respective assets, and neither Pride,
any Subsidiary of Pride nor any agent of any of them has received any such
payments from vendors, suppliers or other persons, where any such payment
made or received is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Pride Material Adverse Effect.   Section 6.25 Amendment to
Pride Rights Agreement. Pride has amended or taken other action under the
Pride Rights Agreement so that none of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the execution and delivery of the Marine Stock Option Agreement,
the conversion of shares of Pride Common Stock into the right to receive
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with this Agreement, the

of the Marine Stock Option or any other transactions contemplated hereby or
by the Marine Stock Option Agreement, will cause: (i) Pride Rights to become
exercisable under the Pride Rights Agreement; (ii) the Company, Pride or any
of Pride\'s shareholders or Subsidiaries to     40  50  be deemed an
"Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Pride Rights Agreement); (iii) any such

Pride Rights under Section 11(a)(ii) of the Pride Rights Agreement; (iv)
Section 13 of the Pride Rights Agreement to be or become applicable to
any such event; or (v) a "Stock Acquisition Date" or a "Distribution Date"
(each as defined in Pride Rights Agreement) to occur upon any such event, and
so that the Pride Rights will expire immediately prior to the Marine Merger
Effective Time. Pride has delivered to Marine a true and complete copy of the
Pride Rights Agreement, as amended to date.   Section 6.26 Pooling of
Interests. To the knowledge of Pride as of the date of this Agreement,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken, or agreed to take, any
action or failed to take any action which action or failure (without giving
effect to any actions or failures to act by Marine or any of its
Subsidiaries) that is known to Pride as of the date of this Agreement to
prevent the treatment of the Mergers contemplated herein as (i) a pooling

or engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person or entity who
has made an unsolicited bona fide written Marine Acquisition Proposal with
respect to all the outstanding capital stock of Marine or all or
substantially all the assets of Marine and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis that, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of Marine,
taking into account the likelihood of financing and consummation, and based

superior to the Mergers (a "Marine Superior Proposal"), to the extent the
board of directors of Marine, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, determines that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its

Acquisition Proposal during the term of this Agreement, it being agreed that
during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to Section 9.3(c)), Marine
shall not enter into any agreement with any person that provides for, or in
any way facilitates, a Marine Acquisition Proposal, other than a
confidentiality and standstill agreement in reasonably customary form with
confidentiality terms at least as favorable to Marine as the Confidentiality
Agreement and which does not contain terms that prevent Marine from complying
with its obligations under this Section.   (d) For purposes hereof, the
"Cutoff Date," when used with respect to Marine, means the date the condition
set forth in Section 8.1(a) is satisfied.     51  61   Section 7.4 No
Solicitation by Pride. (a) Pride agrees that (i) neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and it shall not authorize or permit any of its officers,

limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or
any of its Subsidiaries) to, and on becoming aware of it will stop such
person from continuing to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information), or take
any action designed to facilitate, directly or indirectly, any inquiry,
proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to
its shareholders) with respect to a tender or exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or similar transaction or
series of transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) involving, individually or in the aggregate, 15% or more of the
assets, net revenues, EBITDA or net income of Pride and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis or 15% or more of any class of capital stock of Pride (any
such proposal, offer or transaction being hereinafter referred to as a "Pride
Acquisition Proposal") or cooperate with or assist, participate or engage in
any discussions or negotiations concerning a Pride Acquisition Proposal; and
(ii) it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing; provided that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent

Acquisition Proposal or (B) prior to the Cutoff Date, providing information
(pursuant to a confidentiality and standstill agreement in reasonably
customary form with terms at least as favorable to Pride with respect to
confidentiality as the Confidentiality Agreement and which does not contain
terms that prevent Pride from complying with its obligations under this
Section 7.4) to or engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any
person or entity who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Pride
Acquisition Proposal with respect to all the outstanding capital stock of
Pride or all or substantially all the assets of Pride and its Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis that, in the good faith judgment of the board of
directors of Pride, taking into account the likelihood of financing and
consummation and based on the advice of a financial advisor of recognized
national reputation, is superior to the Mergers (a "Pride
Superior Proposal"), to the extent the board of directors of Pride, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines that the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.   (b) Prior to
taking any action referred to in Section 7.4(a), if Pride intends to
participate in any such discussions or negotiations or provide any such
information to any such third party, Pride shall give prompt prior oral and
written notice to Marine of each such action. Pride will immediately

Rask, or such other person identified by Pride to Marine in writing.   (c)
Nothing in this Section 7.4 shall permit Pride to enter into any agreement

Agreement, it being agreed that during the term of this Agreement
(except pursuant to Section 9.4(c)), Pride shall not enter into any agreement
with any person that provides for, or in any way facilitates, a Pride
Acquisition Proposal, other than a confidentiality and standstill agreement
in reasonably customary form with terms at least as favorable to Pride as the
Confidentiality Agreement and which does not contain terms that prevent Pride
from complying with its obligations under this Section 7.4.   (d) For
purposes hereof, the "Cutoff Date," when used with respect to Pride means the
date the condition set forth in Section 8.1(b) is satisfied.   Section 7.5

incorporation and bylaws to convene a meeting of its shareholders as promptly
as practicable to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Marine Merger in the case of Marine and the Pride Merger
and the Pride Issuance in the case of Pride. The meeting of Marine\'s
shareholder is herein referred to as the "Marine Meeting," the meeting of
Pride\'s shareholders is referred to as the "Pride Meeting," and both such
meetings are referred to as the "Meetings." Marine and Pride shall coordinate
and cooperate with respect to the timing of the Meetings and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to hold the Meetings on the same day.
Notwithstanding any other provision     53  63  of this Agreement,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof,
Marine and Pride shall each (to the extent permitted or limited by the laws

with its outside legal counsel the failure to so withdraw, modify or change
its recommendation and declaration or to so recommend and declare advisable
any Marine Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations.   (c) Pride through its board of directors, has

provided, however, that the board of directors of Pride may at any time prior
to the Marine Merger Effective Time upon five business days\' prior written
notice to Marine, withdraw, modify or change any recommendation and
declaration regarding such matters or recommend and declare advisable any
Pride Superior Proposal, if in the good faith opinion of Pride\'s board of
directors after consultation with its outside legal counsel the failure to so
withdraw, modify or change its recommendation and declaration or to so
recommend and declare advisable any Pride Superior Proposal would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.   (d) The Company has
caused this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby to be approved and adopted by its board of directors and only
stockholder at or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company. If so required by law or the Company\'s certificate of

participate in any meeting or  discussion with any governmental authority in
respect of any filings,  investigation or other inquiry concerning this

authority,  gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat;   (5) furnish the other party with copies of all  correspondence,
filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth  the substance
thereof) between them and their affiliates and their  respective
representatives on the one hand, and any government or  regulatory authority
or members or their respective staffs on the other  hand, with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated  hereby, except for copies

including, without limitation,  any filings necessary or appropriate under
the provisions of the HSR  Act.   (b) Without limiting Section 7.7(a), but
subject to Section 7.7(c), Marine and Pride each shall:   (i) each use
commercially reasonable best efforts to  avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated, terminated or modified, any  decree, order or judgment that would
restrain, prevent or delay the  Closing; and   (ii) each use commercially
reasonable best efforts to  take any and all steps necessary to obtain any

this Agreement shall require any of the Company, Marine or Pride to (i)

the immediately preceding clauses (i) through and including (v) which in each
such case may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Mergers and
the transactions contemplated hereby and which, in the reasonable judgment of
each of Marine and Pride, in each such case do not and are not reasonably
likely to individually or in the aggregate either have a (i) Marine Material
Adverse Effect; (ii) Pride Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) Company Material
Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 10.9(c)) following the Mergers.   (d)
The Company, Marine and Pride intend that the Mergers will each qualify as a

Marine and Pride shall each use their respective commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause each of the Mergers to qualify as reorganizations within the

actions to be taken, or fail to take actions that (i) could reasonably be
expected to prevent either of the Mergers from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or (ii) could reasonably be
expected to cause the Marine shareholders who exchange their Marine Common
Stock for Pride Common Stock pursuant to the Marine Merger or Pride
shareholders, including the former holders of Marine Common Stock,
who exchange their Pride Common Stock for Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Pride Merger to recognize taxable gain with respect to the Marine Merger

paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Rule 145
Affiliates"). Each of Marine and Pride shall use their respective
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is identified

Marine or Pride as a director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee

Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys\' fees),
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or
pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in
their capacities as such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or
after the Effective Time. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (an "Action"), (i) the Company and Pride shall
pay, as incurred, the fees and expenses of counsel selected by
the Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company, in advance of the final disposition of any such Action to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law and, if required, upon receipt of
any undertaking required by applicable law, and (ii) the Company will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, the Pride
Merger Surviving Entity shall not be liable for any settlement effected

more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single Action,
unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified Parties, there
is or may be a conflict of interests between two or more of such Indemnified
Parties, in which case there may be separate counsel for each similarly
situated group.   (b) The parties agree that all rights to indemnification
and any provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of
any action or suit, whether contained in this Agreement or in the charter,
bylaws or other organizational documents of Marine, Pride or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers with respect to matters
occurring through and including the Effective Time.   (c) For a period of
six years after the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be maintained
officers\' and directors\' liability insurance covering the Indemnified
Parties who are, or at any time prior to the Effective Time, covered by
either Marine\'s or Pride\'s existing officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance policies on terms substantially no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties than such existing insurance, provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 150% of the
sum of the last annual premium paid by each of Marine and Pride prior to the
date hereof (the amount of each such premium being set forth in Section
7.15(c) of the Marine Disclosure Letter and Pride Disclosure Letter), but in
such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such
amount.   (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be
in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under

any person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made

assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.15.   Section 7.16

Marine Merger Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Marine
Common Stock (a "Marine Stock Option") granted under Marine\'s plans
identified in Section 5.11 of the Marine Disclosure Letter as being the only
compensation or benefit plans or agreements pursuant to which Marine
Common Stock may be issued (collectively, the "Marine Stock Option Plans"),
whether vested or unvested, shall be deemed assumed by Pride and shall
thereafter be deemed to constitute an option to acquire the same number of
shares of Pride Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Marine Stock Option immediately prior to the Marine
Merger Effective Time (in accordance with the past practice of Marine with
respect to interpretation and application of such terms and conditions). In
addition, Marine shall prior to the Marine Merger Effective Time make any

of the Pride Disclosure Letter as being the only compensation or benefit
plans or agreements pursuant to which Pride Common Stock may be issued,
whether vested or unvested, and all Marine Stock Options assumed by Pride
pursuant to Section 7.16, shall be deemed assumed by the Company and shall
thereafter be deemed to constitute an option to acquire the same number of
shares of Company Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Pride Stock Option or assumed Marine Stock
Options immediately prior to the Pride Merger Effective Time (in accordance
with the past practice of Pride with respect to interpretation and
application of such terms and conditions of Pride Stock Options). In
addition, Pride shall prior to the Marine Merger Effective Time make any

arrangements that are necessary to give effect to the transactions

Agreement, as well as comply with applicable state securities registration
laws, for so long as such options or other equity-based awards remain
outstanding.   (b) The Company, Marine and Pride each agree that all
employees of Marine and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Marine
Merger Effective Time and all employees of Pride and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Pride Merger Effective Time shall be employed by the

maintain for a period of one year after the Pride Merger Effective Time
benefit plans that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, to the employees
covered, respectively, by the Marine Benefit Plans and the Pride Benefit
Plans, except to the extent compliance with this sentence would be unduly
burdensome, or would materially increase the cost thereof in
the aggregate.   Section 7.19 Company Assumption of Indenture Indebtedness.
Prior to or at the Pride Merger Effective Time, Pride and each of its
Subsidiaries shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the
occurrence, as a result of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, of a change in control or any other event
that constitutes a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default) under any indebtedness of Pride. At the Pride
Merger Effective Time, the Company shall, with respect to indebtedness of
Pride the terms of which require the Company to assume such indebtedness in
order to avoid default thereunder (collectively, the "Assumed Indebtedness"),
execute and deliver such supplemental indentures or other instruments as
shall be required under the indentures and other agreements governing such
Assumed Indebtedness, expressly assuming the obligations of Pride with
respect to the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if
any) and interest if any, on, and conversion obligations under all Assumed
Indebtedness.   Section 7.20 Pooling Letters. (a) Marine shall use

Such letter shall be dated as of the effective date of the Form S-4. Marine

letter shall be dated as of the effective date of the Form S-4. Pride shall
also use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain a letter
from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and addressed to Pride, a complete copy of
which shall be delivered to Marine at or before the Marine Merger Effective

Inc. 5847 San Felipe, Suite 3300 Houston, Texas 77057  Ladies and
Gentlemen:   I have been advised that as of the date of this letter I may be
deemed to be an "affiliate" of Marine Drilling Companies, Inc., a Texas
corporation ("Marine"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules
and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
May 23, 2001 (the "Agreement"), among Pride International, Inc., a Louisiana
corporation ("Pride"), Marine, PM Merger, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Pride (the "Company"), and AM Merger, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pride ("Merger Sub"),
Marine will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the "Marine Merger") and
immediately thereafter Pride will be merged with and into the Company (the
"Pride Merger" and together with the Marine Merger, the "Mergers")   As a
result of the Marine Merger, I may receive shares of common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of Pride ("Pride Common Stock") in exchange for shares owned
by me of (i) common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Marine, or (ii) upon
the exercise of options for such shares.   As a result of the Pride Merger,
I may receive shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Company ("Company Common Stock") in exchange for shares owned by me of (i)
Pride Common Stock, or (ii) upon the exercise of options for such shares.  
90    1. I represent, warrant and covenant to Marine and the Company that
as of the date I receive any Pride Common Stock or Company Common Stock as a
result of the Mergers:   A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other
disposition of  Pride Common Stock or Company Common Stock in violation of
the  Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations.   B. I have carefully
read this letter and the Agreement and  discussed the requirements of such
documents and other applicable  limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of  Pride Common Stock or Company Common Stock to the
extent I felt  necessary, with my counsel.   C. I have been advised that
the issuance of Pride Common Stock to  me pursuant to the Marine Merger will
be registered with the Commission  under the Securities Act on a Registration
Statement on Form S-4.  However, I have also been advised that, at the time
the Mergers are  submitted for a vote of the stockholders of Marine, I may be
deemed to  be an affiliate of Marine, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose  of Pride Common Stock or Company Common Stock issued to me in the 
Mergers unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been 
registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other 
disposition is made in conformity with Rule 145 (as such rule may be 
hereafter from time to time amended) promulgated by the Commission under  the
Securities Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably  acceptable to
Company or Pride, or as described in a "no action" or  interpretive letter
obtained by me from the staff of the Commission,  such sale, transfer or
other disposition is otherwise exempt from  registration under the Securities
Act.   D. I understand that neither Pride nor the Company is under any 
obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Pride 
Common Stock or Company Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the 
Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make 
compliance with an exemption from such registration available.   E. I also
understand that stop transfer instructions will be  given to Pride\'s and the
Company\'s transfer agents with respect to Pride  Common Stock and Company
Common Stock, respectively, and that there will  be placed on the
certificates for Pride Common Stock and Company Common  Stock issued to me,
or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in  substance:   "THE
SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH
RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933 APPLIES AND MAY ONLY
BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE  TRANSFERRED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE
REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 145 OR  PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
OR IN ACCORDANCE  WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE  SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."    2  91    F. I also understand that
unless the transfer by me of my Pride  Common Stock or Company Common Stock
has been registered under the  Securities Act or is a sale made in conformity
with the provisions of  Rule 145, each of Pride and the Company reserves the
right to put the  following legend on the certificates issued to my
transferee:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN 
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED  FROM A PERSON
WHO RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH  RULE 145 PROMULGATED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES.  THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY
THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO,  OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY
DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN  THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND
MAY NOT BE SOLD,  PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN
EFFECTIVE  REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM 
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."   G. I also
understand and agree that the representations,  warranties, covenants and
agreements I have made herein are for the  benefit of Marine, Pride and the
Company and will be relied upon by such  entities and their respective
counsel and accountants.   2. By acceptance of this letter by each of Pride
and the Company, each of them hereby agrees with me as follows:   A. For so
long as and to the extent necessary to permit me to  sell Pride Common Stock
or Company Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145  and, to the extent applicable,
Rule 144 under the Securities Act, Pride  and Company shall (a) use their
reasonable efforts to (i) file, on a  timely basis, all reports and data
required to be filed with the  Commission by it pursuant to Section 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act  of 1934, as amended, and (ii) furnish to me upon
request a written  statement as to whether each of Pride and the Company has
complied with  such reporting requirements during the 12 months preceding any
proposed  sale (or for such shorter period that each of Pride and the Company
has  been required to file such reports) of Pride Common Stock or Company 
Common Stock by me under Rule 145, and (b) otherwise use its reasonable 
efforts to permit such sales pursuant to Rule 145 and Rule 144.   B. It is
understood and agreed that the legends set forth in  paragraphs E and F above
will be removed by delivery of substitute  certificates without such legend
if such legend is not required for  purposes of the Securities Act. It is
understood and agreed that such  legends and the stop orders referred to
above will be removed if (i) one  year shall have elapsed from the date I
acquire Pride Common Stock or  Company Common Stock received   3  92  
in the Marine Merger and the Pride Merger, respectively, and the  provisions
of Rule 145(d)(2) are then available to me, (ii) two years  shall have
elapsed from the date I acquire the Pride Common Stock or  Company Common
Stock received in the Marine Merger and Pride Merger,  respectively, and the
provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then available to  me, or (iii) each of
Pride and the Company has received either an  opinion of counsel, which
opinion and counsel shall be reasonably  satisfactory to each of Pride and
the Company, or a "no action" letter  obtained by me from the staff of the
Commission, to the effect that the  restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under
the Act no longer apply to me.   Execution of this letter should not be
considered an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of Marine as
described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights
I may have to object to any claim that I am an affiliate on or after the date
of this letter.    Very truly yours,
