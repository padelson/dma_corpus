failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder&#146;s shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become

Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares, the Surviving Corporation shall not
assert that the Merger Option, the Merger Option Shares or any cash or promissory note delivered
by Merger Sub to the Company in payment for such Merger Option Shares should be considered in
