This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April
14, 2011, is by and among Chesapeake Energy Corporation, an Oklahoma
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Nomac Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ") and Bronco
Drilling Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall commence a cash tender offer (such
tender offer, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time as
permitted by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the issued
and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") at a price per share equal to $11.00
(the " _Offer Price_ "); 

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub have entered into Tender Support Agreements (the "
_Tender Support Agreements_ "), with Third Avenue Management LLC, and
Inmobiliaria Carso, S.A. de C.V. and Carso Infraestructura y
Construccion, S.A.B. de C.V., pursuant to which, among other things, such
entities have agreed to tender shares of Company Common Stock beneficially
owned by them, or over which they otherwise have dispositive power, in the
Offer (the shares subject to such agreements constituting, in the
aggregate, approximately 32% of the Company Common Stock as of the date of
this Agreement) and to take certain actions and exercise certain rights, and
to refrain from taking other actions or exercising other rights, in each
case, as set forth therein; 

  

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub
shall merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "); 

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (i) has approved and declared
advisable this Agreement, (ii) has determined that the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, advisable
and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and (iii) is
recommending that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Company Stockholders_ ") accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company
Common Stock into the Offer and, if required by the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), vote to adopt this Agreement, in
each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; and 

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has (i)
approved this Agreement and (ii) determined that the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in
the best interests of their respective corporations. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE OFFER 

    

SECTION 1.01. _The Offer_. 

  

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article VII and none of the events or conditions set forth in Annex A
(other than clause (e) of Annex A) shall have occurred and be existing and
shall not have been waived by Parent or Merger Sub (the conditions set forth
in Annex A, the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "), Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the
rules and regulations thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. Without
the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not decrease
the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer,
decrease the number of  shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased
in the Offer, impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Tender Offer
Conditions, change or waive the Minimum Condition or, except as provided in
Section 1.01(c), extend the expiration of the Offer beyond the
initial Expiration Date, or amend any other term of the Offer in a manner
materially adverse to the Company Stockholders; _provided_ that Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right to increase the Offer Price and to waive any
condition of the Offer, except the Minimum Condition. The Company agrees that
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall tender into the Offer shares of
Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

(b) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, file with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement
on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer on the date that the Offer is
commenced, which Tender Offer Statement shall include an offer to purchase,
form of transmittal letter and form of notice of guaranteed delivery
(together with any supplements or amendments thereto, collectively, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") and, subject to the Companys compliance with Section
1.02(c), use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders in all material respects in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the U.S. federal securities
laws. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such corrected Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders to the extent required by applicable
Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub
all information concerning the Company that is required or reasonably
requested by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the obligations relating
to the Offer Documents contained in this Section 1.01(b). The Company and its
counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents sufficiently in advance of filing with the SEC or dissemination to
the Company Stockholders, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable
consideration to the Company comments thereon. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer, the Offer shall remain
open until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the 20th Business Day
after the date that the Offer is commenced (the " _Expiration Date_ "),
unless Merger Sub shall have extended the period of time for which the Offer
is open pursuant to, and in accordance with, the second sentence of
this Section 1.01(c) or as may be required by applicable Law, in which event
the term " _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the latest time and date as the
Offer, as so extended may expire. Merger Sub may, without the consent of
Company, (i) extend the Offer for one or more periods of not more than five
Business Days per period if, at the scheduled Expiration Date, any of the
Tender Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived; (ii) extend
the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff of the SEC (the " _SEC Staff_ ") thereof
applicable to the Offer; or (iii) if all of the Tender Offer Conditions
are satisfied but the number of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer, together with any shares of
Company Common Stock then owned by Parent, is less than 90% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, commence a subsequent offering
period (as provided in Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) for three to
20 Business Days to acquire outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to
satisfaction or waiver of the Tender Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause it to, as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date,
accept for payment and pay for (after giving effect to any required
withholding Tax) all shares of Company Common Stock that have been validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. If Merger Sub shall
commence a subsequent offering period in connection with the Offer, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause it to, accept for payment and pay for
(after giving effect to any required withholding Tax) all additional shares
of Company Common Stock validly tendered during such subsequent offering
period. 

   

SECTION 1.02. _Company Action_. 

  

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, and represents
and warrants that the Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly
called and held, has, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, unanimously (i) deemed this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement advisable, fair to and in the
best interests of the Company Stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger, in all respects; and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company
Stockholders accept the Offer, that the Company Stockholders tender their
shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer to Merger Sub, and that
the Company Stockholders adopt this Agreement to the extent required by
applicable Law (the " _Company Recommendation_ "). The Company consents to
the inclusion of the Company Recommendation in the Offer Documents and the
Proxy Statement (if any), subject to Section 4.02(b). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC, on the date that the Offer
is commenced to the extent practicable (and otherwise as promptly as
practicable thereafter), a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 pertaining to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that, subject to Section 4.02(b), contains
the Company Recommendation and to promptly mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the
Company Stockholders together with the Offer Documents and cause the Offer
Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by, and in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the U.S. federal securities
Laws. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given the opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 sufficiently in advance of its
filing with the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the U.S. federal securities laws. The Company,
Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Company Stockholders to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Merger Sub that is required or reasonably requested by Company in
connection with the obligations relating to the Schedule 14D-9 contained in
this Section 1.02(b). 

  

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company promptly will furnish (or cause
its transfer agent to furnish) Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels,
security position listings and any available listing or computer files
containing the names and addresses of the Company Stockholders, each as of a
recent date, and shall furnish Merger Sub with such additional information
and assistance (including updated lists of the Company Stockholders, mailing
labels and lists of securities positions) as Merger Sub or its agents may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Such materials and information
furnished to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this subsection (c) shall be
subject to the confidentiality requirements of Section 5.02, other than with
respect to the usage contemplated by the preceding sentence. 

  

(d) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option
(the " _Merger Option_ ") to purchase up to that number of newly issued
shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Merger Option Shares_ ") equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately
following consummation of the Offer, shall constitute one share more than 90%
of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted
basis (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities
regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other
terms and conditions thereof), after giving effect to the issuance of the
Merger Option Shares, for consideration per Merger Option Share equal to the
Offer Price. 

  

(e) The Merger Option shall not be exercisable if the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject thereto exceeds the number of authorized shares
of Company Common Stock available for issuance or held in treasury, excluding
any shares that are reserved or otherwise committed for other issuance. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(f) In the event that Parent or Merger Sub wish to exercise the Merger Option,
Merger Sub shall give the Company one days prior written notice specifying
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are or will be owned by
Parent and Merger Sub immediately following consummation of the Offer and
specifying a place and a time for the closing of the purchase. The Company
shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver
written notice to Merger Sub specifying the number of Merger Option Shares.
At the closing of the purchase of the Merger Option Shares, the portion of
the purchase price owing upon exercise of the Merger Option that equals the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant
to the Merger Option, multiplied by (ii) the Offer Price, shall be paid to
the Company in cash (by wire transfer or cashiers check) for the amount
equal to the aggregate par value of the Merger Option shares, with the
balance payable, at the election of Parent and Merger Sub, either in cash (by
wire transfer or cashiers check) or by delivery of a promissory note having
full recourse to Parent. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to prime rate of Citibank, N.A. during the period in
which any portion of the principal amount of such promissory note remains
outstanding, calculated on a daily basis on the outstanding principal amount
of the promissory note from the date the promissory note is originally issued
until the date of payment in full of the promissory note, and may be prepaid
without premium or penalty. 

   

SECTION 1.03. _Board of Directors_. 

  

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the acceptance
for payment of  shares of Company Common Stock by Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their affiliates pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Offer
(including the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition) (the " _Appointment
Time_ ") and from time to time thereafter, and subject to Section 1.03(c),
Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors,
rounded to the nearest whole number constituting at least a majority of the
directors, on the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Merger Sub
representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to the product
of the number of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (giving
effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this Section
1.03) and the percentage that such number of shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by Parent or its Affiliates bears to the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to, upon Parents request, promptly, at Parents
election, either increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company
or seeking and accepting the resignation of such number of directors as is
necessary to enable Parents designees to be elected to the Board of
Directors of the Company and to cause Parents designees to be so elected. At
such times, subject to Section 1.03(c), the Company will cause
individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members of each
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, rounded up to the next
whole number, that represents the same percentage as such individuals
represent on the Board of Directors of the Company, other than any committee
of the Board of Directors of the Company established to take action under
this Agreement which committee shall be composed only of Independent
Directors (as defined in Section 1.03(c)). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) The Company obligation to appoint designees to the Board of Directors of
the Company shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required
pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in
order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03, and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company
and its officers and directors as is required pursuant to such Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.03 and the U.S. federal securities
laws. Parent shall provide to the Company and shall be solely responsible for
the information and consents with respect to Parent and its designees,
officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. 

  

(c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or designated to the
Board of Directors of the Company, then, until the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause the Board of Directors of the Company to have at least
two directors who are (i) directors on the date of this Agreement, (ii)
independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of
the Nasdaq Global Select Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") and (iii) reasonably
satisfactory to Parent (such directors, the " _Independent Directors_ ");
_provided, however_ , that, if any Independent Director is unable to
serve due to death or disability or any other reason, the remaining
Independent Directors shall be entitled to elect or designate another
individual (or individuals) who serve(s) as a director (or directors) on the
date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that no such individual is an employee
of Company or its subsidiaries and each such individual is reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) to fill the vacancy, and such director (or directors)
shall be deemed to be an Independent Director (or Independent Directors) for
purposes of this Agreement. If no Independent Director remains prior to the
Effective Time, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the
Company at the time of the execution of this Agreement shall be entitled to
designate two persons to fill such vacancies; _provided_ that such
individuals shall not be employees or officers of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub and shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and such persons
shall be deemed Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.
Following the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause any amendment or termination of this Agreement, any
extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of Merger Sub or Parent or waiver of any of the
Company rights under this Agreement or other action adversely affecting the
rights of the Company Stockholders (other than Parent or Merger Sub), not to
be effected without the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent
Directors. Following the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any action to remove any Independent
Director absent cause.

_Company Certificate_ ") shall be amended at the Effective Time so as to read
in its entirety in the form as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, and, as so
amended, such Company Certificate shall be the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein and by applicable Law. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the Bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately

the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the
case may be. 

  

SECTION 2.07. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers

Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company or (b) otherwise carry out the
provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors

power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or
assurances in law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to
vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties
or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation are authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take
any and all such action. 

  

SECTION 2.09. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any Company Stockholder or
any holder of any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub: 

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. 

  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. Any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by a wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company or by a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other
than Merger Sub) shall remain outstanding after the Effective Time,
appropriately adjusted such that such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of
the Company after the Merger as it owned immediately prior to the Merger. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.09(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest,
equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.11(b), without interest. The
right of any holder of a Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration
shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is
required under applicable Tax Law. 

  

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary,  shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a Company
Stockholder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who did not vote in favor of the
Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in
all respects with, the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (such
shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment for such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (and at the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holders
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share, in accordance
with Section 2.09(c), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or
agree to settle, any such demand for payment. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees
and acknowledges that, in any appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of the
DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares, the Surviving Corporation shall
not assert that the Merger Option, the Merger Option Shares or any cash or
promissory note delivered by Merger Sub to the Company in payment for such
Merger Option Shares should be considered in connection with the
determination of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

SECTION 2.10. _Treatment of Warrant and Company Equity Awards_. 

  

(a) _Warrant_. If Merger Sub shall have purchased shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer, or if the Effective Time shall have occurred,
then the Warrant, to the extent unexercised and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the earliest to occur of (i) the Effective Time, (ii) 20 Business
Days after the Expiration Date or, if there is a subsequent offering period
following the Expiration Date, the expiration of the last subsequent
offering period, and (iii) September 1, 2011 (the earliest of clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii), the " _Conversion Time_ "), shall, in accordance with Section
13(B) of the Warrant and immediately prior to the Conversion Time, terminate
and cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock, and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive therefor from Parent and
Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall pay, no later than two Business
Days following the Conversion Time an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were purchasable upon
exercise of the Warrant as of the Conversion Time (determined without regard
to any limitations set forth in the Warrant as to the
exercisability thereof), and (ii) the Offer Price less the exercise price of
the Warrant as in effect as of the Conversion Time. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Merger Agreement shall be terminated, then the Warrant shall
remain outstanding in accordance with its terms. 

  

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is
restricted (" _Company Restricted Stock_ ") and is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and become non-forfeitable
immediately prior to the Effective Time and will be cancelled at the
Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. 

  

(c) _Payment_. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.10 will be paid
as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event no
later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time, and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payments as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time in accordance with the foregoing and the
terms of the Warrant, the applicable Company Restricted Stock or the
applicable Company Stock Plan. 

  

(d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plan) and Parent shall adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions as may be required to effect the foregoing actions
set forth in clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 2.10 and shall make such
other changes to the Company Stock Plan as Parent and the Company may agree
are appropriate to give effect to the Merger. 

  

(e) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, following the
Effective Time, no participant in the Company Stock Plan, Company Benefit
Plan or Company Benefit Agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire
any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any other
equity interest therein (including "phantom" stock or stock
appreciation rights). In addition, the Company shall take all actions as may
be necessary to terminate the Company Stock Plan as of the Effective Time. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

SECTION 2.11. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
deposit, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.09(c). Any funds
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." 

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in
customary form and contain customary provisions) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of record of one or more Certificates shall, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate or Certificates, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.09(c), and the Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.11(b) may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.11(b), each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be
paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II. 

  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day
on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of
the Merger Consideration to the holder thereof as provided in this Article
II. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain
liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Article II. 

  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any funds from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to four years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of Parent. If
for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. 

  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Article II. 

  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision
of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

ARTICLE III 

   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 

   

SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set
forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior
to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ")
(with specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of this
Agreement to which the information set forth in such disclosure schedule
relates, provided that the disclosure of any fact or item in any section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall, should the existence of such fact or
item be relevant to any other Section or subsection, be deemed to be disclosed
with respect to such other Section or subsection to the extent that such
disclosure is cross-referenced to the other Section or subsection), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has been duly organized, and is validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, as the case
may be, and has all requisite power and authority and possesses all
governmental consents, licenses, orders, franchises, rights,
registrations licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals, whether state
or local, United States or foreign, necessary to enable it to use its
corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its
properties and other assets and to carry on its business as currently
conducted (the " _Permits_ "), except where the failure to have such Permits,
has not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize that concept) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified,
licensed or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had,
and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent, prior to the date of this Agreement (i)
complete and accurate copies of the Company Certificate and the Bylaws of the
Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), (ii) the comparable organizational
documents of each significant subsidiary (as such term is defined in Rule
12b-2 under the Exchange Act, a " _Significant Subsidiary_ ") and (iii) the
Warrant Agreement, dated September 18, 2009, between the Company and Banco
Inbursa S.A., Institucion de Banca Multiple, Grupo Financiero Imbursa (the "

SECTION 3.02. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_.
Except set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the Company
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_
") (with specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of this

relates), Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company

Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and has all
requisite corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to use
its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate
its properties and other assets and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except where the failure to have such governmental licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize that concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and could not
reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has
made available to the Company complete and accurate copies of the Certificate
of Incorporation of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Certificate_ ") and the
Bylaws of Merger Sub, in each case as amended to the date of this
Agreement. 

 

    #####

this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly

Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware). This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub,
as applicable, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, in
accordance with its terms. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by

of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with the provisions of this
Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of,
or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give
rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancellation, modification or
acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or result

materially impeded, interfered with, hindered or delayed, and could not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay, the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization
of, action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with,
any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or Merger
Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Merger Sub or the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer, the

not reasonably be expected to impair, in any material respect, the ability of

indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which could reasonably be
expected to, facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries, proposals or
offers or any other efforts or attempts that constitute or may reasonably be
expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal, or, in each case, the making
thereof, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal or
(iii) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any
contractual "standstill" or similar obligation of any person other than
Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 4.02(a)
by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions
or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to the Appointment Time, in response to a _bona fide_
written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) is or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover
Proposal was not solicited after the date of this Agreement and was made after
the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 4.02(a), the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c),
(x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement (which (A) need not restrict such person from
making an unsolicited Takeover Proposal and (B) shall permit the Company to
comply with the terms of Section 4.02(c)) containing confidentiality and
other provisions substantially similar to the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement and not less restrictive to such person than
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent; _provided_
that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is
provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such person and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Takeover Proposal, if and only to the extent that in
connection with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Board of Directors of
the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably expected to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the
Company) or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net income
or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or
more of any class of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, or
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
which any person or the stockholders of any person would own 15% or more of
any class of equity securities of the Company or of any resulting parent
company of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. 

  

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ offer made by a third
party that if consummated would result in such person (or its stockholders)
owning, directly or indirectly, more than 75% of the shares of Company Common
Stock then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger
or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or
more than 75% of the assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors of
the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i) more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the Offer and the Merger (taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
offer or otherwise)), (ii) not subject to any due diligence or financing
condition and (iii) reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed,
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of
such proposal. 

  

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent the
Company Recommendation, (B) take any other action or make any public
statement in connection with the Company Recommendation, the Offer, the
Merger or the Company Stockholders Meeting that is inconsistent with the
Company Recommendation or (C) adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to
adopt or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_
") or (ii) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or recommend,
or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar Contract constituting or related to,
or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 4.02(a)) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to the Appointment Time, the Board of Directors
of the Company may: (1) other than in response to a Takeover Proposal or an
event that constitutes the receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal
or 

  

    ##### 

  

   

any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if a development or a change in circumstances occurs or
arises after the date of this Agreement that was not known by the Board of
Directors of the Company as of the date of this Agreement and a majority of
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and (2) subject to Section 4.02(c), in response to a Takeover
Proposal that the Board reasonably determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that
was unsolicited and made after the date of this Agreement and that did not
otherwise result from a material breach of this Section 4.02, (A) make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the Company
has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board
of Directors to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.01(f) and concurrently with or after such termination enter into
an Acquisition Agreement if the Board of Directors of the Company has
concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of
Directors to terminate this Agreement would be reasonably expected to result
in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however,_ that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the foregoing clause (B), and any purported termination pursuant to the
foregoing clause (B) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless
concurrently with such termination the Company pays to Parent the Termination
Fee and the Expenses payable pursuant to Section 5.05(b);  _provided,
further, however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its
right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) unless the Company has: (A) provided to
Parent five Business Days prior written notice (such notice, a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Board of Directors of
the Company intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor,
including the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis
of the proposed action by the Board of Directors (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and
a new five Business Day period), (B) during such five Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that the Takeover Proposal which was
determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal
and (C) at the end of such five Business Day period, such Takeover Proposal
has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
(taking into account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal, as a result
of the negotiations required by clause (C) or otherwise). 

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours of learning of the relevant information) advise Parent orally
and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity
of the person making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep
Parent fully informed in all material respects of the status and details
(including any change to the material terms thereof) of any Takeover
Proposal. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from at any time taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange
Act or making a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or
other applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the
Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or
resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b).

by this Agreement, shall not withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent the Company Recommendation and shall include the Company Recommendation

this Agreement, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn such meeting
without the consent of Parent other than (i) as necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Companys stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of

Sub or any of Parents other Subsidiaries in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Company agrees

the event that Parent or Merger Sub shall acquire, together with the shares

appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as

DGCL without a meeting of the Company Stockholders. 

   

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

applicable Law) during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice
to the Company during the period prior to the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement to all its and its Subsidiaries properties,
books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records as Parent may from time
to time reasonably request, and, during such period, the Company
shall furnish promptly to Parent (x) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and (y) all
other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries 

  

    ##### 

  

   

business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. If any of
the information or material furnished pursuant to this Section 5.02 includes
materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each party
understands and agrees that the parties have a commonality of interest with
respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual
understanding of the parties that the sharing of such material or information
is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way
the confidentiality of such material or information or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
other applicable privilege. All such information provided by the Company that
is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to
such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint
defense doctrine. 

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold, and shall cause their
respective Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to

SECTION 5.03. _Further Action; Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation
to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees (i) to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
and any other applicable Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date of this

    ##### 

 

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section

applicable Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate
in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably
informed of the status of matters related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including furnishing the other with any written notices or
other communications received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or foreign
Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review
and consult with each other in advance of any communication given by it to,
or any meeting or teleconference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding under Antitrust Law
by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the
FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other person,
give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and teleconferences in accordance with Antitrust Law. 

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 5.03(a) and (b), each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with any filing or submission required or action to be taken by
either Parent or the Company to consummate the Offer and the Merger, in no
event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to
(and the Company shall not) propose, negotiate, agree to accept, commit to or
effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or the
Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates) or otherwise
take or commit to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit
Parents freedom of action with respect to, or ability to retain, any portion
of Parents or the Companys or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates
business or assets (a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). 

  

(d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each
other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.03 shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii), so long as such party has up to
then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
Section 5.03. 

  

SECTION 5.04. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. 

  

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the obligations
with respect to all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of current
or former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
provided in the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, the organization
documents of any Subsidiary or any written indemnification Contract between
such directors or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement), without further action, as of the Effective Time and
such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms. A true and complete copy of the form
of indemnification agreement governing all such contractual indemnification
obligations has been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof. 

  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain (directly or
indirectly through the Companys existing insurance programs) in effect the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore
delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that Parent may (i) substitute therefor
policies of Parent containing terms with respect to coverage (including
as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) and amounts no less
favorable to such directors and officers or (ii) request that the Company
obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance
programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); _provided, further,_
that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.04(b), neither the
Company nor Parent shall be obligated to pay more than 250% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance (which annual
premiums are set forth in Section 5.04(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule); _provided_ , _further_ , that, it is understood and agreed that in
the event such coverage cannot be obtained for such amount or less in the
aggregate, Parent shall only be obligated to provide such coverage as may be
obtained for such aggregate amount. 

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.04 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified, covered or protected party,
his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification, advancement
of expenses, exculpation or contribution that any such person may have by
Contract or otherwise.

SECTION 5.05. _Fees and Expenses_. 

  

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 5.05, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Offer
or the Merger is consummated, except that the filings fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation by the financial printer, filing,
printing and mailing of the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy
Statement shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company. 

  

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(e), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(f) or (iii)(A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the
Company or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company
generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall
have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a
Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (I) by Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or (II) by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within 12 months after such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive Contract to consummate, or
consummates, the transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal
(regardless of whether such Takeover Proposal is made before or after
termination of this Agreement), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal
to $ 13,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") plus Expenses (without
duplication if paid under any other provision of this Agreement) of up to $1.5
million, by wire transfer of same-day funds on the first Business Day
following (x) in the case of a payment required by clause (i) or (ii) above,
the date of termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case of a payment
required by clause (iii) above, the date of the first to occur of the events
referred to in clause (iii)(C) above. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated (i) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
7.01(b)(iii); or (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c), then the Company
shall pay Parent all of its Expenses up to $1.5 million, by wire transfer of
same-day funds on the first Business Day following the date of termination
of this Agreement. " _Expenses_ " shall mean the cash amount necessary to
reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates for all
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred (whether or not billed)
at any time (whether before or after the date of this Agreement) prior to the
termination of this Agreement by any of them or on their behalf in connection
with the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement, their due diligence investigation
of the Company and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the fees and expenses of counsel, investment banking firms or financial
advisors and their respective counsel and representatives). 

  

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in Section 5.05(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to Section 5.05(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for
the Termination Fee and/or Expenses, the Company shall pay to Parent its
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee
and/or Expenses, as the case may be, from the date such payment was required
to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system. The parties agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be in the form previously agreed to by the parties.

Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than any employees covered
by collective bargaining agreements) (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall
receive base salary, bonus opportunities and employee benefits that, in the
aggregate, are substantially similar to those received by similarly
situated employees of Parent; _provided_ that (i) continued bonus
opportunities for Continuing Employees under the Company Benefit Plans and
Company Benefit Agreements and (ii) continued participation by Continuing
Employees in the Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements, in each
case following the Effective Time, shall constitute receiving substantially
similar bonus opportunities and employee benefits to those received by
similarly situated employees of Parent;  _provided_ , _further_ , that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries
shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements

ARTICLE V 

   

INDEMNIFICATION 

   

SECTION 1. RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION. Each person who was or is made a party or
is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(hereinafter a "Covered Person"), whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer,
employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation
to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss
(including, without limitation, attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA
excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such Covered Person in connection with
such proceeding; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 3 of
this Article V with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify a Covered Person in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Covered
Person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board. 

  

SECTION 2. RIGHT TO ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article V, a Covered Person
shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses
(including, without limitation, attorneys fees) incurred in
defending, testifying, or otherwise participating in any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses");
provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL")
requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by a Covered Person in his or
her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other
capacity in which service was or is rendered by such Covered Person,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an
"undertaking"), by or on behalf of such Covered Person, to repay all amounts
so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision
from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final
adjudication") that such Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified for
such expenses under this Article V or otherwise. 

  

SECTION 3. RIGHT OF INDEMNITEE TO BRING SUIT. If a claim under Section 1 of
this Article V or Section 2 of this Article V is not paid in full by the
Corporation within 60 days after a written claim therefor has been received
by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of
expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the Covered
Person may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in
any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Covered
Person shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting or
defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the Covered Person to enforce
a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by a Covered
Person to enforce a right to an

  

    ##### 

  

   

advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover
such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the Covered Person has not met
any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither
the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties
to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such suit that indemnification of the Covered Person is proper in
the circumstances because the Covered Person has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including a determination by its directors who are not parties
to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) that the Covered Person has not met such applicable standard
of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Covered Person has not met
the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by
the Covered Person, shall be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by
the Covered Person to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement
of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that
the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement
of expenses, under this Article V or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. 

  

SECTION 4. NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS. The rights provided to Covered Persons
pursuant to this Article V shall not be exclusive of any other right which
any Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, an agreement, a vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. 

  

SECTION 5. INSURANCE. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense,
to protect itself and/or any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. 

  

SECTION 6. INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHER PERSONS. This Article V shall not limit
the right of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner authorized or
permitted by law to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than
Covered Persons. Without limiting the foregoing, the Corporation may, to the
extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights
to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or
agent of the Corporation and to any other person who is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan,
to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article V with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of Covered Persons under this
Article V. 

  

SECTION 7. AMENDMENTS. Any repeal or amendment of this Article V by the Board
of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in
applicable law, or the adoption of any other provision of these By-laws
inconsistent with this Article V, will, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in
applicable law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights to Covered Persons on a retroactive basis than permitted prior
thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or
protection existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent
