corporation (the " _Company_ "), ACCELERATE HOLDINGS CORP., a Delaware

but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in Section 9.2.

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Buyer, Merger Sub and
the Company have unanimously approved and declared it advisable to enter into
this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ ") in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Buyer, Merger Sub and
the Company have each declared that it is in the best interests of their
respective companies and stockholders to consummate the Merger provided for
herein;

 

WHEREAS, immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition to the willingness of Buyer and Merger Sub to enter into
this Agreement, the Company shall have delivered to Buyer and Merger Sub the
irrevocable written consent of the Stockholders required to adopt and approve
the Merger and this Agreement under the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company (collectively, the " _Stockholder Consent_ ");

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this
Agreement, each of TPG Partners V, L.P. and TPG Partners VI, L.P. (each, a "

" _Limited Guarantee_ ") in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,

the

 



 

1  satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) or on such other

that, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than conditions

desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise,
in the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under
any of the properties, rights, privileges, powers, franchises or assets of
either the Company or Merger Sub or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of

directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of the

shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes. As of the Effective Time,
the Option Plans shall terminate and all rights under any provision of any
other plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect
of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall be
cancelled;

 

(h) After the Effective Time, all capital stock of the Company, and any
options relating thereto, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired, or converted in accordance with this
Section 2.1, as the case may be, and each holder of a certificate representing
any such shares or options shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, other than the right to receive the consideration provided herein,
subject to Section 2.5.

SECTION 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) JPMorgan Chase and Co. (or an affiliate thereof) shall act, at Buyers
expense, as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in effecting the exchanges
provided for herein. The amount specified by Section 2.3(a) shall be paid by
Buyer at the Closing to the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account (or accounts) specified by Paying Agent to
Buyer in writing no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
for disbursement as provided for herein; _provided_ , _however,_ that to the
extent that Certificates (as defined below) and duly executed and completed
Letters of Transmittal are provided to Buyer or the Company at least two
Business Days before Closing, then the holder of Shares or Warrants to which
such documents relate shall be paid the Per Share Closing Merger
Consideration or Warrant Cancellation Payment, as applicable, payable at the
Closing with respect thereto directly by Buyer on the Closing Date.



 

5 (b) To the extent not previously provided, at the Effective Time, or as soon
as practicable thereafter (but not later than five Business Days thereafter),
the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed, or otherwise make
available, to each holder of certificates or other instruments (collectively,
the " _Certificates_ ") formerly evidencing (x) Shares (except for Cancelled
Shares and Dissenting Shares) or (y) Warrants the form of the Letter of
Transmittal. After the Effective Time, upon surrender of such Certificates to
the Paying Agent, together with the completed Letter of Transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive from the Paying
Agent, in exchange therefor, the aggregate consideration for such Shares or
Warrants, as the case may be, in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, less
any applicable withholding taxes, and such Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. The Paying Agent and Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Warrants, as the case
may be, such amounts as the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of applicable tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares or Warrants, as the case may be, in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be. Until surrendered as contemplated
by, and in accordance with, this Section 2.2, each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares or Cancelled Shares), shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive the aggregate consideration for such Shares or Warrants, as the
case may be, in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest
thereon.

 

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of any Shares or Warrants, as the
case may be, that is not registered in the transfer books of the Company,
subject to any applicable deductions or withholdings as described in Section
2.2(a) above, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Certificate shall be lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and an undertaking of
indemnity by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Surviving Corporation will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(d) At any time following the expiration of 9 months after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, in its sole discretion, be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying
Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and such
funds shall thereafter become the property of the Surviving Corporation. Such
funds may be commingled with the general funds of the Surviving Corporation
and shall be free and clear of any claims or interests of any Person.
Thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable consideration
payable as contemplated by this Agreement (net of any amounts that would be
subject to withholding) upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any
interest thereon. Any portion of such remaining

 



 

6  cash unclaimed by holders of Shares, Warrants or Options, as the case may
be, as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfer in the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares, Warrants or
Options, as the case may be, that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.2.

 

(f) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but not later than
five Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall, in exchange
for the Options that become entitled to receive the consideration specified in
Section 2.1, make the payment in respect of each such Option to each Option
Holder utilizing the Companys payroll system (and the Paying Agent will be
directed to fund those amounts directly to the Companys payroll account). The
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Option
Holder such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
applicable tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Option Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(g) All payments to be made under Section 2.2 shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately funds to an account designated by the holder of the Shares,
Warrants or Options, as the case may be, except as otherwise agreed by the
payor and payee. Wire instructions shall be provided to the Surviving
Corporation at least two Business Days prior to the applicable payment date. 

SECTION 2.3 _Payments at Closing_. At the Closing, Buyer will make (or cause
to be made) the following payments: 

(a) to the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account or accounts designated by the Paying Agent in writing no later
than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal to the
Closing Merger Consideration _minus_ (1) any amounts payable to holders of
Shares or Warrants who have previously provided a duly executed Letter of

(d) on behalf of the Company, the amount payable to each counterparty or

SECTION 2.4 _Merger Consideration Adjustments_. 

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a good-faith estimate of the
Companys (i) Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital_ "), (ii) Funded Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Funded Indebtedness_
"), (iii) Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ ") and (iv) Transaction Expenses (the
" _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), each determined as of the close of
business on the day prior to the Closing Date (and, except for the Transaction
Expenses and Funded Indebtedness, without giving effect to the transactions
contemplated herein), based on the Companys books and records and other
information available at the time, with Net Working Capital calculated on a
basis consistent with  _Exhibit 2.4_. All such estimates will be accompanied
by a schedule of information showing the Companys method of calculating them,
together with a certificate from the Companys Chief Financial Officer
certifying that such estimates have been calculated in good faith in
accordance with this Agreement.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than
60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders) a closing statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") that shall
include and set forth (A) a balance sheet of the Company as of the close of
business on the day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_
"), which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP ( _provided_ , that the
Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Net Working Capital shall (i) be based
exclusively on the facts and circumstances as they exist as of the close of
business on the day prior to the Closing Date and shall exclude the effect of
any event, act, change in circumstances or similar development arising or
occurring thereafter (including on the Closing), and (ii) need not contain
footnote disclosures and, in the case of Net Working Capital, be prepared
and calculated on a basis consistent with _Exhibit 2.4_ and, on that basis,
set forth the Surviving Corporations calculation of Net Working Capital (the
" _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), Funded Indebtedness (the " _Closing
Funded Indebtedness_ ") and Cash (the " _Closing_ Cash") and (B) the actual
Transaction Expenses. To the extent any actions on or following the Closing
with respect to the accounting books and records of the Surviving



 

8  Corporation on which the Closing Balance Sheet and the foregoing
calculations included in the Closing Statement are to be based are not
consistent with the Companys past practices, such changes shall not be taken
into account in preparing the Closing Balance Sheet or calculating the Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Funded Indebtedness and Closing Cash.

 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) permit the Stockholders Representative and its
Representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and other
documents (including work papers, schedules, financial statements, memoranda,
etc.) and shall cooperate with the Stockholders Representative in seeking to
obtain work papers from the Surviving Corporation pertaining to or used in
connection with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Funded Indebtedness,
Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses and provide the Stockholders
Representative with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by the
Stockholders Representative), as well as to other documents reasonably
requested by the Company, subject to execution by such parties of a customary
access letter to the extent reasonably required by the Surviving
Corporations accountants and (ii) provide the Stockholders Representative and
its Representatives reasonable access to Buyers and the Surviving
Corporations employees and accountants responsible for and knowledgeable
about the information used in, and the preparation or calculation of, the
Closing Statement as reasonably requested by the Stockholders Representative
(including the Surviving Corporations chief financial officer and certified
public accountants), subject to execution by such parties of a customary
access letter to the extent reasonably required by the Surviving Corporations
accountants. If the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders) disagrees with any part of the Surviving Corporations
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Funded Indebtedness
Closing Cash and/or Transaction Expenses, as set forth on the Closing
Statement, the Stockholders Representative shall, within 60 days after the
Stockholders Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, notify Buyer
in writing of such disagreement by setting forth in reasonable detail the
Stockholders Representatives calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Funded Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Transaction Expenses, as
applicable, and describing the basis for such disagreement (an " _Objection
Notice_ "). If an Objection Notice is delivered to Buyer, then Buyer and the
Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to the computation of
the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Funded Indebtedness Closing Cash
and/or Transaction Expenses. In the event that Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) are unable to resolve all such
disagreements within 30 days after Buyers receipt of such Objection Notice,
Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall submit such remaining
disagreements to Deloitte LLP (New York office), or a nationally recognized
certified public independent accounting firm as is acceptable to Buyer and
the Stockholders Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). If no Objection
Notice is delivered to Buyer within 60 days after the Stockholders
Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, on the next succeeding
day such Closing Statement shall be deemed final and binding on Buyer and the
Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders).

 

(d) Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining
disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Funded Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Transaction Expenses
identified in the Objection Notice as soon as 



 

9  practicable, but in any event shall direct the Accounting Firm to render a
determination within 60 days after its retention. The Accounting Firm shall
consider only those items and amounts in the Surviving Corporations and the
Stockholders Representatives respective calculations of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Funded Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Transaction
Expenses that are identified as being items and amounts to which the
Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders Representative have been unable to
agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party. The Accounting Firms determination of the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Funded Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Transaction Expenses, as the
case may be, shall be based solely on written materials submitted by Buyer
and the Stockholders Representative ( _i.e._ , not on independent review) and
on the definitions of "Net Working Capital," "Funded Indebtedness,"
"Cash" and "Transaction Expenses" set forth herein and on a basis consistent
with and in accordance with the methodologies and principles contemplated
herein. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further
review.

(e) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining the Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Funded Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or
Transaction Expenses, as the case may be, shall be borne by Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders),
on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party. For example, if Buyer claims the Closing Net Working
Capital is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the Stockholders
Representative, and the Stockholders Representative contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by Buyer, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding Buyer $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated 60% ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to
the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) and 40% (
_i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to Buyer. In connection with its determination of Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Transaction
Expenses, as the case may be, the Accounting Firm shall, pursuant to the terms
of this Section 2.4(e), also determine the allocation of its fees and
expenses between Buyer and the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders), which such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties hereto.

 

(f) Within five Business Days after the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses are finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.4:

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Net Adjustment Amount_ " shall
mean an amount equal to zero _plus_ (i) the amount by which Estimated Net
Working Capital is less than Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.4 (" _Final Net Working Capital_ "), if any,
_minus_ (ii) the amount by which Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than
Final Net Working Capital, if any, _plus_ (iii) the amount by which Estimated
Cash is less than Closing Cash as finally determined pursuant to this Section
2.4 (" _Final Cash_ "), if any, _minus_ (iv) the amount by which Estimated
Cash is greater than Final Cash, if any, _minus_ (v) the amount by which
Estimated Indebtedness is less than Closing Indebtedness as finally
determined pursuant



 

10  to this Section 2.4 (" _Final Indebtedness_ "), if any, _plus_ (vi) the
amount by which Estimated Indebtedness is greater than Final Indebtedness, if
any, _minus_  (vii) the amount by which Estimated Transaction Expenses is
less than the actual Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 2.4 (" _Final Transaction Expenses_ "), if any, _plus_ (viii)
the amount by which the Estimated Transaction Expenses is greater than the
Final Transaction Expenses, if any;

 

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, Buyer shall promptly deliver to
the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) the Net
Adjustment Amount up to a maximum payment by Buyer equal to the Adjustment
Holdback Amount;

 

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, the Stockholders
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) shall promptly deliver to
Buyer from the Adjustment Holdback Amount the absolute value of the Net
Adjustment Amount up to a maximum payment by the Stockholders Representative
equal to the Adjustment Holdback Amount;

 

(iv) In the event that any funds remain in the Adjustment Holdback Account
after completion of the payment of the adjustments described in Section
2.4(f)(ii) or Section 2.4(f)(iii) above, the Stockholders Representative shall
distribute to each Stockholder its respective pro rata portion (calculated
based on the Fully Diluted Stock Count) of all remaining amounts with respect
to the Adjustment Holdback Amount (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be
the entire Adjustment Holdback Amount in the event a payment was to be made
under Section 2.4(f)(iii) above) to the account designated by such
Stockholder and no further payment shall be payable by Buyer or the
Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) under this Section
2.4;

 

(v) Any payment of the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.4(f)
shall include interest, as applicable, at a rate per annum equal to the prime
rate of interest reported from time to time in _The Wall Street Journal_ ,
calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over 360, from
the Closing Date to the date of payment. Any payment of the Net Adjustment
Amount, other than payments of stated interest thereon, shall (x) be treated
by all parties for tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Merger
Consideration and (y) be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account(s) designated by Buyer or the Stockholders Representative, as
applicable. The obligations of the parties described in this Section 2.4(f)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties, as applicable, for any
and all claims arising under this Agreement with respect to this Section
2.4(f);

(vi) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Stockholders
Representative shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any distributions
made by it to the Stockholders under this Section 2.4(f) such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold under any provision of applicable tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
Stockholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.



 

11 SECTION 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
the Companys capital stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by holders who shall not have voted in favor
of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who shall
have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have not withdrawn such demand
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.1.
Such holders shall be entitled to receive such consideration as is determined
to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held
by holders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn, waived or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the consideration specified in Section 2.1, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.2, of the
certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares.
At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL and as provided in this Section 2.5(a).

(b) The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Buyer, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

of operations and changes in financial position of the Company (consolidated
with its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to which it relates for the period or as
of the date set forth therein, all in conformity with GAAP 



 

15  consistently applied during the periods involved, except as otherwise noted
therein or as disclosed on Section 3.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule and
subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments (which are not expected to be material), the absence of
notes and any other adjustments described therein. Except as set forth on
Section 3.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company SEC Reports, (i)
complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and (ii) when filed, as finally amended prior to the date
hereof, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or
obligations of a nature required to be reflected on a balance sheet or
described in the financial statement footnotes prepared in accordance with
GAAP (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than

of doubt, the notes thereto) filed with the SEC prior to the date of this
Agreement or reflected in the notes thereto, (ii) incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the financing of such
transaction, (iii) incurred since January 2, 2010 in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and that would not in the aggregate be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (iv) which
are disclosed on Section 3.5(b) of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

SECTION 3.6 _Absence of Changes_. Except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the
Disclosure Schedule, since January 2, 2010 through the date of this
Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have operated in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
there has not been:

 

(a) any event, circumstance, development, condition, occurrence, state of
facts, change or effect which, individually or in the aggregate, has had a
Company Material Adverse Effect; or

(b) any material casualty event with respect to any material property or
assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries (whether or not covered by
insurance); or

(c) any action, which, if taken after the date hereof, would require the
consent of Buyer under Section 5.1(b)(iii), (iv), (vi), (vii), (xi), (xii),
(xiii), (xv) or (xvi) hereof.

 

SECTION 3.7 _Assets and Properties_.

 

(a) Section 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list
of all real property and interests in real property owned (the " _Owned Real
Property_ "), leased or subleased (the " _Leased Real Property_ "), by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof. Prior to the date
hereof, the Company has made available to Buyer true and complete copies of
all lease and sublease agreements applicable to the Leased Real Property.
Except as set forth in Section 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedule or for defects
in title (or other Encumbrances) or failures to be in full force and effect,
none of which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each of the Company and

 



 

16  its Subsidiaries has fee simple title to the Owned Real Property, or a
valid, binding and enforceable leasehold interest in the Leased Real Property
(including all rights, title, privileges and appurtenances pertaining or
relating thereto). Neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
Companys knowledge, any other party to any lease or sublease applicable to
the Leased Real Property, is in breach or default under such lease or
sublease, and, to the Companys knowledge, no event has occurred or
circumstance exists which, with the delivery of notice, the passage of time or
both, would constitute such a breach or default, or permit the termination,

hereunder (including all payments to be made in connection herewith by Buyer,

Corporation, Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Barclays
Bank PLC, Royal Bank of Canada, RBC Capital Markets, UBS Loan Finance LLC, UBS
Securities LLC and Banc of America Bridge LLC to provide debt financing in an

26   _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which lenders party thereto have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend the
amounts set forth therein for the purposes of financing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and related fees and expenses (the " _Debt
Financing_ "), and (ii) executed commitment letters from each of TPG Partners
V, L.P. and TPG Partners VI, L.P. to provide equity financing in an aggregate

and together with the Debt Financing Commitments, the " _Financing
Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the investor parties thereto have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to invest
the amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and together with
the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, each of the
Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect
and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of Buyer, and, to the
knowledge of Buyer, each of the other parties thereto. Prior to the date
hereof, the respective commitments contained in each of the Financing
Commitments has not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect (and no party
thereto has indicated an intent to so withdraw or rescind) or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect. As of the date hereof, neither Buyer nor
Merger Sub is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in any of
the Financing Commitments and no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach or failure to satisfy a condition precedent set forth therein. As of
the date hereof, Buyer or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other fees on the dates and to the extent required by the Financing
Commitments. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies relating
to the funding of the full amount of the proceeds of the Financing except as
stated in the Financing Commitments. The parties acknowledge and agree that
it shall not be a condition to the obligations of Buyer or Merger Sub to
effect the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
Buyer continue to have access to the financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments or other materials delivered to the Company evidencing Buyers
possession of sufficient funds for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on or prior to the date hereof ( _i.e._ , Buyers obligations are
not conditioned upon the availability of financing).

SECTION 4.8 _Ownership of Shares_. None of Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their
"affiliates" or "associates" is or has been, within three years of the date
hereof, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, as those terms are defined
in Section 203 of the DGCL.

SECTION 4.9 _Merger Sub_. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose
of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the
Effective Time will have engaged in no other business activities and will have
incurred no liabilities or obligations other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein, including the Financing. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub is, and as of the Effective
Time will be, owned directly by Buyer, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

 

SECTION 4.10 _Solvency_. At the Effective Time, assuming (i) satisfaction of
the conditions to Buyers and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the
Merger as set forth herein, or waiver of such conditions, (ii) the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III
hereof (for such purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true
and correct in all material respects without giving effect to any "knowledge",
materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualification or exception),
including the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.5(a), and
(iii) any estimates, projections or



 

27  forecasts provided by the Company to Buyer prior to the date hereof have
been prepared in good faith on assumptions that were and continue to be
reasonable and shall be attained or be attainable, as applicable, (A) the
amount of "fair saleable value" of the assets of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries will, as of such date, exceed, as of such date, the sum of
(i) the value of all "liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other liabilities,
and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on its
existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and matured; (B) the Surviving Corporation will not have, as of such
date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged by Buyer
following such date; and (C) the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they become due.
For purposes of this definition, not having "an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged" means that
the Surviving Corporation will be able to generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to
meet its obligations as they become due. No transfer of property is being made
and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 4.11  _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of Buyer is necessary to adopt this
Agreement or approve the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, other
than any vote or approval obtained prior to the date hereof. The vote or
consent of Buyer as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall have
occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the only vote or consent of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary to
adopt this Agreement or approve the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

SECTION 4.12 _Limited Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, each Guarantor has delivered to the Company a duly executed
Limited Guarantee. As of the date of this Agreement, each Limited Guarantee is
in full force and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation
of the applicable Guarantor, and no event has occurred, which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part
of such Guarantor under such Limited Guarantee.

 

SECTION 4.13 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, the Company
acknowledges that none of Buyer, Merger Sub or any other Person on behalf of
Buyer or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Buyer or Merger Sub or with respect to any other
information provided to the Company.

would resolve such objections or suits.

 

(c) In connection with the matters contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
will use commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing Date to give
all required notices to third parties and to obtain all required third party
consents as Buyer may request; _provided_ that the Company shall not make, nor

directors of the Company (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") and their respective
successors, heirs and legal representatives, shall be binding on all

Corporation shall provide Company Employees with annual rates of base salary
or hourly wages, as applicable, annual incentive opportunities (excluding
equity-based incentives) and coverage and benefits pursuant to employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements that are, in the
aggregate, not materially less favorable in the aggregate than the
compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employees immediately prior
to the Closing; _provided_ , however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall prevent or preclude Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
from amending, terminating, substituting or otherwise replacing any plan,
program or arrangement that it chooses, nor require the continued employment
of any Company Employee on or after the Closing.



 

35 (b) Where applicable, each such Company Employee shall receive full credit for
service with the Company and its Affiliates (including predecessor companies)
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and accrual
under each employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement to be
provided by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation to such Company Employee to
the same extent such service was recognized under the applicable Plan
immediately prior to the Closing except where such crediting would result in
duplicate benefits and for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
pension plan. In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to
any Company Employee under any plan, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees and their covered
dependents under such plan (except to the extent that such conditions,
exclusions or waiting period would apply under the Plans absent any change in
such welfare coverage plan) and (ii) provide each Company Employee and his or
her covered dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to any such change in coverage in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements under such new or changes plan.

(c) This Section 5.9 is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable benefit, claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, nor
shall it be considered to be an amendment of any plan, program or arrangement
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, it shall
not take any action, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to take no action,

(the " _New Financing Commitments_ ") so long as, in each case described in
the foregoing clause (y), the Company provides its written consent to such
amendments or new debt financing commitments, which consent may only be
withheld on the basis of the Companys reasonable determination that such
amendments or new debt financing commitments would adversely impact the
likelihood or timing of the funding of the financing represented thereby
relative to the Debt Financing Commitments as in effect prior to such
amendment or new debt financing commitments (and in such event, the term "
_Financing Commitments_ " as used herein shall be deemed to include the

practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the final
day of the Marketing Period or, if earlier, the Outside Date. Buyer shall give
the Company prompt notice of any material breach (or any other breach that

Required Information and that the conditions set forth above have been
satisfied, it may deliver to Buyer a written notice to that effect (stating
when it believes it completed such delivery), in which case the Marketing

Buyer in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not completed delivery
of the Required Information or such conditions have not been satisfied
and, within four Business Days after the delivery of such notice by the
Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with
specificity which Required Information the Company has not delivered or which
conditions have not been satisfied); _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced (i) if, prior to the

included in the Required Information that is available on the first day of any
such 20 consecutive Business Day period would not be sufficiently current on
any day during such period to satisfy the requirements under Rule 3-12 of
Regulation S-X for a registration statement using such financial statements to
be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such period; and
_ provided_ , _further_ , that the Marketing Period shall be suspended in the
event that at any time during such Marketing Period the conditions set forth
in Section 6.1(b) shall not be satisfied, in which case such Marketing Period
shall resume at such time, if any, that the conditions set forth in Section
6.1(b) are satisfied and shall expire upon the date that is the later of (A)
10 consecutive Business Days after the date of such resumption but no later
than the Outside Date (provided that the Outside Date shall be deemed
extended to the last day of such Marketing Period, but in no event past August
13, 2010) and (B) the number of consecutive Business Days (including the date
of suspension) remaining in such Marketing Period on the date of suspension.

with the arrangement of the Financing, including (i) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence

Company sends a notice that the Required Information has been provided
pursuant Section 5.14(a) with respect to which Buyer does not provide a
notice to the Company pursuant to Section 5.14(a) to the effect that the
Required Information has not been delivered, including the financial

(but not prior to the Closing) to the extent direct borrowings or debt
incurrence by the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries is
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments; _provided_ , however, that
nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
unreasonably interfere with the business or



 

40  operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or require the Company to
agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or give any indemnities prior to
the Closing for which Buyer does not promptly reimburse or indemnify it, as
the case may be, under this Agreement. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and

Sub shall be permitted to disclose such information to potential sources of
capital and to rating agencies and prospective lenders and investors during
syndication of the Debt Financing subject to the potential sources of capital,
prospective lenders and investors entering into customary confidentiality
undertakings with respect to such information, with the Company being a

(ii) the Buyer Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly
pay the Buyer Termination Fee and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Company commences a suit that results in a judgment against Buyer for the
Buyer Termination Fee, Buyer shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of such amount at the prime rate of interests
reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that the Buyer Termination Fee
becomes payable, the Companys right to receive payment of the Buyer
Termination Fee from Buyer pursuant to

 



 

46  this Section 7.5 and the reimbursement and indemnification obligations
pursuant to Section 5.14(b) or the guarantees thereof pursuant to the Limited
Guarantees shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates against Buyer, Merger Sub, the Guarantors and any
of their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents
for the Losses suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, and upon payment of such amounts, none of Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Guarantors or any of their respective former, current, or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers,
Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Closing does not
occur, in no event shall Buyer be subject to (nor shall the Company or any of
its Affiliates seek to recover) monetary damages in excess of the Buyer
Termination Fee. In no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates seek
to recover monetary damages from any of Buyers Affiliates or Representatives
(other than as provided in the Limited Guarantees and subject to the
limitations therein). If this Agreement is terminated and the Merger is
abandoned pursuant to this Article VII, all confidential information received
by Buyer or its Representatives and Affiliates with respect to the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall be treated in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Stockholders Representative shall have no right

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the
Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by
the Company. It is accordingly agreed that Buyer shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the
Company and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
in any court in the United States or any state having jurisdiction, subject to
Section 8.6(b), this being in addition to any other remedy to which Buyer may
be entitled at law or in equity. The Company further agrees that it shall not
object to the granting of injunctive or other equitable relief on the basis
that there exists adequate remedy at law.

 



 

50 (c) The parties hereto future further agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by Buyer or Merger Sub in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached by Buyer or Merger Sub. It is accordingly agreed that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be
entitled to (x) specific performance of Buyers obligation to cause the Equity

specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches of
or enforce compliance with those covenants of Buyer and Merger Such, in each
case, that require Buyer or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under
Section 5.14(a), in each case, in any court in the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, subject to Section 8.6(b), this being in addition to any
other remedy to which Buyer may be entitled at law or in equity;  _provided_
, _however_ , such remedies in this Section 8.10(c) shall be available to the
Company only in the event that (i) all condition in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have
been satisfied (or, with respect to certificates to be delivered at the
Closing, are capable of being satisfied upon the Closing) at the time when the
Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be
funded and (ii) the financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letters
(or, if alternative financing is being using in accordance with Section 5.14,
pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been fully funded (or
will be fully funded if the Equity Financing is Funded at the Closing) or is
otherwise available to be drawn down by Buyer. The parties acknowledge and
agree that the Company shall only be entitled to injunctive or other equitable
relief against Buyer and Merger Sub as and to the extent specifically provided
in the immediately prior sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, under no
circumstances shall the Company be entitled or permitted to receive both a
grant of specific performance and money damages against Buyer or Merger Sub
(other than pursuant to the indemnity and reimbursement provisions of Section
5.3, the reimbursement obligations under Section 5.5(c), the reimbursement
obligations under the third to last sentence of Section 5.14(b) and any costs
and expenses awarded by the court in connection with such action), including

SECTION 8.11 _Survival of Representations and Warranties; No Recourse_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no representations
or warranties in this Agreement shall survive the Merger. Subject to the
foregoing, in no event following the Closing shall Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or the Company have any recourse against (i) any Persons who were
stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time who have
executed the Stockholder Consent, or the former warrant holders or
option holders of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time who
have executed a similar instrument, or any Affiliates or Representatives
thereof, in each such case with respect to matters relating to the Company or
(ii) the former directors or officers of the Company, or any Affiliates or
Representatives thereof, in each such case with respect to any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company, Buyer or Merger Sub in
this Agreement, other than any rights against Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 5.7.



 

51 SECTION 8.12 _Damages_. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree
that no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect

income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach
or alleged breach of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.13 _Disclosure Schedule_. The representations and warranties
contained in Articles III are qualified by reference to the Disclosure
Schedule attached hereto. The parties hereto agree that the Disclosure
Schedule is not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as
constituting, representations and warranties of the Company except to the
extent expressly provided in this Agreement. Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge
that (i) the Disclosure Schedule may include items or information that
the Company is not required to disclose under this Agreement, (ii) disclosure
of such items or information shall not affect, directly or indirectly, the
interpretation of this Agreement or the scope of the disclosure obligation of
the Company under this Agreement and (iii) inclusion of information in the
Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to the Company. Similarly, in such matters where a
representation or warranty is given or other information is provided, the
disclosure of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall not imply that any
other undisclosed matter having a greater value or other significance is
material. Buyer and Merger Sub further acknowledge that headings have been
inserted on Sections of the Disclosure Schedule for the convenience of
reference only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of any
of the provisions of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule.

 

SECTION 8.14 _Stockholders Representative_. By the approval of this Agreement
pursuant to applicable Law and execution of the Stockholder Consent,

(a) Each Stockholder irrevocably appoints the Stockholders Representative as
the representative, agent and proxy for all the Stockholders for all purposes
under this Agreement including the full power and authority to act on the
Stockholders behalf: (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement (including the adjustments under Section 2.4) and the other
agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in
connection herewith; (ii) to negotiate disputes arising under, or relating to,
this Agreement (including with respect to the adjustments under Section 2.4)
and the other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or
executed in connection herewith; (iii) to receive and disburse to the
Stockholders any funds received on behalf of the Stockholders under this
Agreement or otherwise; (iv) to withhold any amounts received on behalf of the
Stockholders to this Agreement or otherwise to satisfy any and all obligations
or liabilities incurred by the Stockholders or the Stockholders
Representative in the performance of their duties hereunder; (v) to execute
and deliver any amendment or waiver to this Agreement and the other
agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in
connection herewith (without the prior approval of the Stockholders); and
(vi) to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of the Stockholders
in connection with this Agreement (including with respect to the adjustments
under Section 2.4) and the other agreements, instruments, and documents
contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith. The Stockholders, by
approving this Agreement, further agree that such agency and proxy are coupled
with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the
Stockholders Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity,
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of

 



 

52  any Stockholder. All decisions and actions by the Stockholders
Representative shall be binding upon all of the Stockholders, and no
Stockholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same. The Stockholders Representative shall have no duties or
obligations hereunder, including any fiduciary duties, except those set forth
herein, and such duties and obligations shall be determined solely by the
express provisions of this Agreement.

(b) Each Stockholder severally, for itself only and not jointly, agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders Representative and its partners,
managers, officers, agents and other Representatives against all expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts incurred
by such Persons in connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which
the Stockholders Representative or such other Person is made a party by reason
of the fact that it is or was acting as, or at the direction of, the
Stockholders Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(c) Neither the Stockholders Representative nor any of its members, managers,
officers, agents or other Representatives shall incur any liability to any
Stockholder by virtue of the failure or refusal of such Persons for any reason
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the
performance of their duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions
constituting intentional and knowing fraud. The Stockholders Representative
and its members, managers, officers, agents and other Representatives shall
have no liability in respect of any action, claim or proceeding
brought against such Persons by any Stockholder, regardless of the legal
theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed,
whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or
otherwise, if such Persons took or omitted taking any action in good faith.

(d) Following the date that is the earlier of (x) twelve months from
the Closing Date or (y) the later of (i) the final determination of all
adjustments pursuant to Section 2.4 and (ii) full reimbursement of all Charges
(as defined below), the Stockholders Representative shall distribute any
remaining portion of the Stockholders Representative Expense Holdback Amount
to the Stockholders on a pro rata basis (calculated based on the Fully Diluted
Stock Count), it being understood and agreed that such distributions shall be
the responsibility of the Stockholders Representative only and that neither
Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation to ensure that
such distribution is, or distributions are, made. The Stockholders
Representative shall have the right to recover from, in its sole discretion,
the Representative Expense Holdback Account prior to any distribution to the
Stockholders, the Stockholders Representatives (including its
Representatives) reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance
of its duties hereunder (the " _Charges_ "). In the event the Stockholders
Representative Expense Holdback Amount is insufficient to satisfy the Charges,
then each Stockholder will be obligated to pay its pro rata portion
(calculated based on the Fully Diluted Stock Count) of such deficit.

(e) At any time prior to the distribution of the Stockholders Representative
Expense Holdback Amount pursuant to Section 8.14(d) above, a majority-in-
interest of the Stockholders may, by written consent, appoint a new
representative as the Stockholders Representative. Notice together with a copy
of the written consent appointing such new representative and bearing the
signatures of Stockholders of a majority-in-interest of those Stockholders
must be delivered to Buyer and each other Stockholder not less than ten days
prior 



 

53  to such appointment. Such appointment will be effective upon the later of
the date indicated in the consent or the date such consent is received by
Buyer. For the purposes of this paragraph (e), a "majority-in-interest of the
Stockholders" shall mean Stockholders holding more than 50% of the Shares
entitled to vote at a duly called meeting of Stockholders to vote thereon.

 

(f) In the event that the Stockholders Representative becomes unable or
unwilling to continue in his or its capacity as Stockholders Representative,
or if the Stockholders Representative resigns as the Stockholders
Representative, a majority-in-interest of the Stockholders may, by written
consent, appoint a new representative as the Stockholders Representative.
Notice and a copy of the written consent appointing such new representative
and bearing the signatures of a majority-in-interest of the Stockholders must
be delivered to Buyer and each Stockholder. Such appointment will be effective
upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the date such consent
is received by Buyer.

(g) Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon any action or decision of, or
instruction by, or any document or other paper delivered by, the Stockholders
Representative on behalf of the Stockholders (without any obligation to
inquire into the authority of the Stockholders Representative or the
genuineness or correctness of such document or other paper or any signature
of the Stockholders Representative), and Buyer shall not be liable to any
Stockholder for any action taken or omitted to be taken by Buyer in such
reliance or with respect to actions, decisions and determinations of the
Stockholders Representative.

SECTION 8.15 _Legal Representation_. Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company and their
respective Affiliates acknowledge and agree that Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP
(" _Gibson Dunn_ ") has acted as counsel for some of the stockholders of the
Company, the Company and their respective Affiliates for several years and
that, in the event of any post-Closing disputes between the parties hereto,
such stockholders of the Company reasonably anticipate that Gibson Dunn will
represent them in such matters. Accordingly, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company
and their respective Affiliates expressly: (a) consent to Gibson Dunns
representation of such stockholders of the Company in any post-Closing matter
in which the interests of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company on the one
hand, and the stockholders of the Company, on the other hand, are adverse,
whether or not such matter is one in which Gibson Dunn may have previously
advised such stockholders, the Company or their respective Affiliates; (b)
consent to the disclosure by Gibson Dunn to such stockholders of the Company
or their Affiliates of any information learned by Gibson Dunn in the course of
its representation of the stockholders of the Company or their respective
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), whether or not such
information is subject to attorney client privilege or Gibson Dunns duty of
confidentiality; and (c) do not consent to the disclosure after the Closing
Date by Gibson Dunn to such stockholders of the Company or their Affiliates
of any information owned by the Company learned by Gibson Dunn in the course
of its representation of the Company, whether or not such information is
subject to attorney client privilege or Gibson Dunns duty
of confidentiality. Furthermore, Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company
irrevocably waive any right they may have to discover or obtain information or
documentation relating to the representation of such stockholders of the
Company by Gibson Dunn in the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent
that such information or documentation was privileged as to such stockholders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or their
respective Affiliates are not prohibited from obtaining or using information
that is owned by the Company or is in its possession.



 

54  Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Affiliates further
covenant and agree that each shall not assert any claim against Gibson Dunn in
respect of legal services provided to the Company or its Affiliates by Gibson
Dunn in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. If and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing, Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Company or their Affiliates shall have the right to assert or
waive an attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between
the Company or its Affiliates and any Person representing them that occurred
at any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or
their Affiliates shall be entitled to waive such privilege without any
consent of any holders of Shares solely to the extent such privilege is not
shared or common to such holders of Shares.

Purchase Price Adjustments

 

This Exhibit describes the basis of preparation, and contains example
preparations, of Net Working Capital, to be used in connection with the
preparation of Estimated Net Working Capital and Closing Net
Working Capital.1

 

 _ _Net Working Capital__

In addition to the provisions provided in Section 2.4 and elsewhere in the
Agreement, the Accounting Principles to be applied in calculating Net Working
Capital for purposes of preparing the Estimated Net Working Capital and
Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.4 of the Agreement are as
follows:

_Basis of preparation:_

 

When calculating the value of the Included Accounts, these line items should
be comprised of the specific trial balance accounts that were included
in presenting these same Included Accounts, and the same classifications
shall be used as were used, in the Companys Audited Financial Statements and
the example calculations below.

 

 _Accounting Principles:_

In addition to, and in furtherance of, the provisions of Section 2.4 of the
Agreement, Net Working Capital shall be prepared in good faith and calculated
in accordance with the same accounting methodologies, principles, practices
and procedures used in and on a basis consistent with, those applied by the
Company in preparing the Audited Financial Statements (including calculating
accounting reserves, accruals and write-offs in accordance with the same
methodology used to calculate such reserves, accruals and write-offs in
preparation of the Audited Financial Statements). Net Working Capital shall
(i) not include any purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) be
based on facts and circumstances as they exist as of the close of business on
the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall exclude the effect of
any act, decision, change in circumstances or other event or development
arising or occurring thereafter (including on the Closing Date), (iii) utilize
the policies, practices and procedures consistent with those used in preparing
the Audited Financial Statements and the example calculations below and (iv)
not include any non-cash releases of accruals or reserves between the date of
the Audited Financial Statements and the Closing, other than normal changes of
estimates consistent with past practices. In determining Net Working Capital
the issue date of the items on the balance sheet shall be the close of
business on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date notwithstanding the
fact that the Closing Statement is delivered after such date.
