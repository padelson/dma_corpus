ARTICLE 2 
 THE AMALGAMATION

  



  

Section 2.01 _. The Amalgamation. _(a) Gateway agrees that promptly, but in
any event within 20 days after the date hereof, it will cause Amalgamation
Sub to be formed under the laws of Bermuda.  Gateway agrees that it will own
100% of the common shares of the Amalgamation Sub at the Effective Time.  At
the

  



  

4      
   



  

Effective Time, Amalgamation Sub shall be amalgamated (the " **Amalgamation**
") with the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act
and this Agreement, and the separate existence of Amalgamation Sub and the
Company shall thereupon cease. The company resulting from the Amalgamation
shall operate under the name of "FLAG Telecom Group Limited" and continue
under the provisions of the Companies Act and other applicable Bermuda law
and is referred to herein as the " **Amalgamated Company** ".

  



  

(b) The Amalgamation shall be consummated by filing with the Registrar of
Companies of Bermuda (the " **Registrar** ") a duly executed and verified
application for registration of the Amalgamated Company and such other
documents as are required by the Companies Act. The Amalgamation shall be
effective on the date shown in the Certificate of Amalgamation issued by the
Registrar (the " **Effective Time** "). Prior to the filing referred to in
this Section 2.01(b), a closing (the " **Closing** ") shall be held, which
shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 450 Lexington
Avenue, New York, New York 10017, on the first Business Day on which each of
the conditions set forth in Article 9 shall have been fulfilled or waived (if
permissible under applicable law), or at such other time and place as Gateway
and the Company may agree.

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Amalgamated Company shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of
the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company
and Amalgamation Sub, all as provided in the applicable provisions of the
Companies Act.

  



  

Section 2.02. _Treatment of Shares in the Amalgamation. _At the Effective
Time:

  



  

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive $95.61 in cash, without interest
(the " **Amalgamation Consideration** "). The sum of the aggregate
Amalgamation Consideration and all amounts payable in respect of Company
Options pursuant to Section 2.05 shall not exceed $207,000,000.

  



  

(b) Each ordinary share of Amalgamation Sub that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one ordinary share of the Amalgamated Company by virtue of the Amalgamation
and without any action on the part of Gateway (or any other holder of any
shares of Amalgamation Sub).

  



  

Section 2.03 _. Surrender and Payment. _(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall appoint an agent (the " **Exchange Agent** ") reasonably
satisfactory to Gateway for the purpose of exchanging certificates
representing Shares (or any other evidence of ownership of Shares) (the "
**Certificates** ") for the Amalgamation Consideration. Prior to the
Effective Time, Gateway will provide to the Exchange Agent, in full,
the Amalgamation Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares

  



  

5      
   



  

(such amount not to be withdrawn).  Promptly after the Effective Time,
Gateway will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
registered holder of Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that the delivery of the Amalgamation Consideration
shall be effected only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and all other documents that may be reasonably required from
each holder to effect the transfer of the Amalgamation Consideration to each
such holder or its designee (collectively, the " **Exchange Documents** ").

  



  

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with
properly completed Exchange Documents, each holder of a Certificate will be
entitled to receive the Amalgamation Consideration payable in respect of each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes
only the right to receive such Amalgamation Consideration.

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Amalgamation Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Shares or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates formerly
representing Shares are presented to the Amalgamated Company, they shall be
cancelled and the Amalgamation Consideration shall be paid in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Article 2.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Amalgamation Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income
earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six months
after the Effective Time shall be returned to Gateway, upon demand, and any
such holder who has not surrendered his Shares for the Amalgamation
Consideration in accordance with this Section prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Gateway or the Amalgamated Company for payment of the
Amalgamation Consideration in respect of his Shares. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Gateway, Amalgamation Sub, the Company, the Amalgamated
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
Amalgamation Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Subject to applicable
law and public policy, if any Certificates shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which any Amalgamation Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any governmental entity, any amounts payable in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by

  



  

6

Company (a " **Company Option** "), whether or not vested or exercisable, to
be canceled as of the Effective Time. Thereafter, each Company Option
whether or not vested or exercisable shall represent only the right to
receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any,
of the Amalgamation Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such
Company Option by (ii) the number of Shares such holder could have purchased
(assuming full vesting of all Company Options) had such holder exercised such
Company Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its best efforts to
(i) obtain any consents from holders of Company Options and (ii) make any
amendments to the terms of the applicable stock option or compensation plans
or arrangements that, in the case of either clauses (i) or (ii), are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 2.05(a).

Gateway shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the

of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax
law. If the Amalgamated Company or Gateway, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which the
Amalgamated Company or Gateway, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such

respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by
this Article 2.

the Company of a Superior Proposal in compliance with Section 6.03) that were
not caused by any action or intentional inaction by the Company or any of its

permit any of its or the Companys Subsidiaries officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other
agents or advisors to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take
any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books
or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except access that may
be required to be afforded to shareholders of the Company pursuant to the
laws of Bermuda) to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly
assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party
that may reasonably be expected to be seeking to make, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing if, prior to the date when the condition
set forth in Section 9.01(b) shall have been satisfied, the Company receives
a proposal or offer that was not solicited, initiated or knowingly
facilitated or encouraged by the Company and that did not otherwise result
from a breach of Section 6.03(a) and that the Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) could reasonably be expected to result in a Third Party
making a Superior Proposal, and subject to compliance with Section 6.03(c),
the Company may, to the extent it determines it is necessary to comply with
the applicable fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors, as determined in
good faith by it after consultation with outside counsel, (i)
furnish information or access with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to such Third Party pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality
agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Gateway) and (ii) participate
in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding such proposal or
offer. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the advisors,
employees and other agents of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions and negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to
the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its agents or
advisors) in possession of confidential information about the Company that
was furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy all
such information.

  



  

(c) The Board of Directors shall not participate in discussions or
negotiations with any Person regarding a proposal or offer or provide
information as permitted by Section 6.03(b) unless the Company shall have
delivered to Gateway a prior written notice advising Gateway that it intends
to take such action, and the Company shall continue to advise Gateway with
respect to such

  



  

22      
   



  

matters after taking such action. In addition, the Company shall notify
Gateway promptly after receipt by the Company (or any of its advisors) of any
Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that, to the knowledge of the Company, may be
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party
making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request. If the Company provides any non-public information or
access to such Third Parties, the Company shall offer to provide to Gateway
the same information and access as is provided to such Third Party on the
same terms (including execution of a confidentiality agreement). The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep Gateway fully informed, on a
current basis, of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.03 shall prohibit the Company (i)
from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position and making the
disclosure required by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the 1934 Act, as amended
or (ii) from making any other required disclosure to the Companys
shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, failure to make such other
disclosure would be inconsistent with its obligations under law.

  



  

" **Superior Proposal** " means any bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding Shares on
terms that the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority
vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation, are more favorable and provide
greater value to all the Companys shareholders than as provided hereunder
and for which financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or
reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors.

  



  

Section 6.04 _. Notices of Certain Events. _The Company shall promptly
notify Gateway of any of the following of which it has knowledge:

  



  

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(b) any notice or other communication from any governmental or regulatory
agency or authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Sections 4.12 or 4.16, as the case may be, or that relate to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

with respect to action taken since October 9, 2002 contained in the Amended
and Restated Bye-Laws of the Company or the organizational documents of its
Subsidiaries and in any agreements between an Indemnified Party and the
Company or its Subsidiaries set forth on Schedule 7.02 on the date of this
Agreement. For a period of five (5) years after the Effective Time,
the Amalgamated Company shall, and Gateway shall cause the Amalgamated
Company to, provide and maintain policies of directors and officers
liability insurance with respect to actions taken since October 9, 2002 (a)
providing at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, materially no less advantageous to
the insured as those policies currently maintained by the Company set forth
on Schedule 7.02 on the date of this Agreement, (b) which shall not result in
any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring after
October 9, 2002 and prior to the Effective Time, (c) providing coverage for a
five (5) year period after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising
from acts, facts, errors, omissions or events that occurred since October 9,
2002 and on or before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (d) so long as the
premium to be paid by the Company for such policies does not exceed 200% of
the premium to be paid for the 12-month period ending on the date hereof;
provided that if such policies cannot be obtained at such cost, the Company
shall obtain as much of such policies as can be so obtained at a cost equal
to 200% of the premium to be paid for the 12-month period ending on the date
hereof. This covenant shall survive

  



  

24      
   



  

the Effective Time and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs and legal representatives.

 COVENANTS OF GATEWAY AND THE COMPANY

  



  

The parties hereto agree that:

  



  

Section 8.01 _. Reasonable Best Efforts. _Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws
and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.02 _. Certain Filings. _(a) The Company and Gateway shall cooperate
with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Company
Disclosure Documents, including, without limitation, the Company
Proxy Statement, each conforming to the requirements of the 1934 Act and
other applicable statutes and regulations, (ii) in determining whether any
action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency,
official, or authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts,
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iii) in taking such actions or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the Company
Disclosure Documents and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers.

  



  

(b) The Company and Gateway shall, and Gateway shall cause the Amalgamation
Sub to, promptly make all required filings and submissions, and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to take all actions, in each case, necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to obtain any
required approvals of any governmental authority with jurisdiction over the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In connection with, and without
limiting, the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agree to file any filing
or submission with any governmental authority, the absence of which would
cause the conditions set forth in Sections 9.01(c) or 9.01(d) to fail, no
later than the date (the " **Filing Deadline** ") that is 21 days after the
date of this Agreement (with respect to the FCC) and that is 30 days after
the date of this Agreement (with respect to the HSR Act and the laws, rules
and regulations analogous to the HSR Act existing in non-U.S. jurisdictions,
if any); _provided_  that if, despite the reasonable best efforts of each of
the parties (made in good faith), such filings are not made by the Filing
Deadline, then the date set forth in Section 10.01(b) shall be extended for a

  



  

25      
   



  

number of days equal to the number of days between the Filing Deadline and
the date such filings are actually made (exclusive).

  



  

Section 8.03 _. Public Announcements. _Gateway and the Company will consult
with each other before issuing any press release or making any
public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by applicable law or any
listing agreement with any securities exchange, will not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation.

  



  

Section 8.04 _. Further Assurances. _At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Amalgamated Company will be authorized
to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
Amalgamation Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Amalgamation Sub,
any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Amalgamated Company any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets and obligations and
liabilities of the Company and Amalgamation Sub acquired or to be acquired by
the Amalgamated Company as a result of, or in connection with, the
Amalgamation.

  



  

Section 8.05 _. Resolution Period. _(a) __ If, after the date hereof, any
law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree shall be in effect
such that the condition set forth in Section 9.01(a) or 9.02(e) is reasonably
unlikely to be satisfied prior to February 28, 2004, then the parties hereto
agree to use their reasonable best efforts during the period ending on the
later of February 28, 2004 and the end of the Resolution Period with respect
to such law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree to restructure
this transaction into a Substantially Equivalent Transaction that would
minimize the effect of such law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or
decree such that the conditions set forth in Sections 9.01(a) and 9.02(e) can
be satisfied.

  



  

(b) The parties also agree that if any part of a Resolution Period extends
beyond February 28, 2004 (such part being hereinafter referred to as the "
**Extension Period** "), then during such Extension Period, the provisions of
Section 6.03(b) and 6.03(c) shall terminate on February 28, 2004 and be of no
further force and effect (other than the obligations of the Company to keep
informed and update Gateway regarding any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
or request made by a Third Party as contemplated therein) and, except as set
forth herein, the parties shall have no further rights or obligations
thereunder.

  



  

(c) The parties further agree that if any investigation, proceeding, suit or
action shall be pending or instituted in any jurisdiction that Gateway
reasonably determines in good faith would have an adverse impact that would
be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or
Infocomm and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), then the parties hereto
shall use their reasonable best efforts to restructure this transaction into
a Substantially Equivalent

  



  

26      
   



  

Transaction that would minimize the adverse impact of such investigation,
proceeding, suit or action.

  



  

(d) For the purposes of this Agreement, " **Resolution Period** " shall mean
the 45-day period commencing with respect to any law, regulation, judgment,
injunction, order or decree contemplated by Section 9.01(a) or Section
9.02(e), on the date that Gateway reasonably determines in good faith, in
accordance with Section 9.01(a) or 9.02(e), as the case may be, that such
law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree would cause the
condition in Section 9.01(a) and 9.02(e), as the case may be, not to
be satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt, a Resolution Period shall commence
with respect to each law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree
that would cause the condition set forth in Section 9.01(a) or 9.02(e) not to
be satisfied.

  



  

(e) For the purposes of this Agreement, " **Substantially Equivalent
Transaction** " shall mean a transaction or related transactions that provide
the parties hereto with substantially the same benefits as the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on terms substantially equivalent to the terms
contained in this Agreement; _provided_ that the consideration paid to
the shareholders of the Company in any Substantially Equivalent Transaction
shall not be less than the aggregate Amalgamation Consideration.

injunction, order or decree shall be in effect in any jurisdiction (other

_provided_ , however, that the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause any such law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or
decree to be rescinded, vacated, lifted or otherwise resolved in a manner
favorable to the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this condition
shall be deemed satisfied unless Gateway reasonably determines in good faith
that any such law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree would
have an adverse impact that would be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or Infocomm and its Subsidiaries (taken as a
whole).

  



  

(b) The Amalgamation and this Agreement shall have been approved and adopted
by the requisite affirmative vote of the shareholders of the Company at a

Effective Time, except (i) that such representations and warranties that
address matters only as of a particular date shall remain true and correct as
of such date and (ii) where the failure of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or materially to impair the ability of the Company to

Section 10.02 _. Effect of Termination. _(a) __ If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of
no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto, except that the
agreements contained

  



  

30      
   



  

in this Section 10.02 and Sections 11.01, 11.04, 11.05, 11.06, 11.07, 11.08,
11.10, 11.12, 11.13 and 11.14 shall survive the termination hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if a termination resulted from the (A)
willful failure of a party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the
obligations of the other party or (B) breach by any party hereto of any
representation or warranty made as of the date hereof, the party whose breach
or failure resulted in such termination shall be fully liable for any and all
damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure
or breach or (ii) if a termination of this Agreement results in the
Termination Fee described in Section 11.04 becoming payable, the Company
shall be obligated to pay such Termination Fee in accordance with the terms,
and at the times, specified therein. Under no circumstances shall any
party hereto be liable for punitive, exemplary or special damages.

  



  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Gateway pursuant to Section 10.01(b),
Gateway agrees that if Reliance Infocomm Limited or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, " **Infocomm** ") thereafter requires additional capacity into
or out of India (by lease or purchase, including indefeasible rights of use)
from a Third Party provider any or all of which is available on the Companys
network (" **Required Capacity** "), Infocomm will notify the Company of such
need and ask the Company to submit a proposal to supply such Required
Capacity. If the Company submits a proposal for such Required Capacity within
10 days after such request, and such proposal would satisfy any or all of the
Required Capacity and is on terms that are substantially equal to or better
than the most favorable bona fide proposal submitted to Infocomm by any bona
fide Third Party alternative providers, Infocomm will purchase the Required
Capacity from the Company on the Companys proposed terms. If the terms of
such proposal are not substantially equal to or better than the
most favorable such bona fide proposal, Infocomm will negotiate with the
Company in good faith to reach agreement on terms for the Required Capacity
that are reasonably acceptable to Infocomm and are at least substantially
equal to or better than the most favorable bona fide proposal that Infocomm
receives from any bona fide Third Party alternative providers with respect to
the Required Capacity. Infocomm will purchase the Required Capacity from the
Company if, following a reasonable period for such negotiations as is
customary in the industry, the Company is able to provide terms that are
substantially equal to or better than the most favorable terms offered by
other Third Party alternative providers. For purposes of this Section
10.02(b), terms shall be considered "substantially equal", "better" or "most
favorable" as determined in good faith by Infocomm based upon its needs for
the Required Capacity and the price, quality, delivery and other reasonable
criteria.

  



  

Infocomms obligations under this Section 10.02(b) will terminate upon the
earlier to occur of (i) the third anniversary of the date that Gateway
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(b) and (ii) the date when
a Change of Control occurs.

  



  

31      
   



  

For the purpose of this Section 10.02(b), " **Change of Control** " means
(i) any "person" or "group" is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as such
terms are used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act, except that a
Person shall be deemed to have "beneficial ownership" of all securities that
such Person has the right to acquire, whether such right is exercisable
immediately or only after the passage of time or the occurrence of a
subsequent condition), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Shares
(measured by voting power rather than number of shares) or (ii) the Company
consolidates or merges with or into any other Person or sells,
assigns, conveys, transfers, leases, licenses or otherwise disposes of all
or substantially all of its assets and the assets of the Companys direct
and indirect subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) to any other Person, in
either in one transaction or a series of related transactions, other than
a consolidation or merger or disposition of  assets: (x) of or by the
Company into or to a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company or (y) pursuant to
a transaction in which the outstanding Shares are changed into or exchanged
for securities or other property with the effect that the beneficial owners
of the outstanding Shares of the Company immediately prior to such
transaction, beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least a 75% of the
Shares (measured by voting power rather than number of shares) of the
surviving corporation or the Person to whom the Companys assets
are transferred immediately following such transaction.
