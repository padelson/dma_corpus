Adjustment Amount and a calculation of the amount, if any, payable pursuant to
this Section 2.3(h). Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith for 30
days to resolve such Divestiture Disputes. If a resolution cannot be
reached through good faith negotiation within 30 days then, at the request of
either Purchaser or Seller, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly engage and
submit the unresolved Divestiture Disputes to the Independent Accountant, and
such Divestiture Disputes shall be resolved

 



19  in accordance with Section 2.3(e) (with such Divestiture Disputes deemed to
be "Unresolved Items" for this purpose).

 

(ii) If the Divestiture Adjustment Amount as set forth in the statement
delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(h)(i) (as may be amended pursuant to
Section 2.3(h)(i)) (A) exceeds the Estimated Divestiture Adjustment Amount,
then Seller shall pay Purchaser an amount equal to such excess, or (B) is
exceeded by the Estimated Divestiture Adjustment Amount, then Purchaser shall
pay Seller an amount equal to such excess.

(iii) The party that is required to make a payment pursuant to this Section
2.3(h) shall make such payment within five Business Days after the later of
the delivery of the statement pursuant to Section 2.3(h)(i) and the final
determination of all Divestiture Disputes pursuant to Section 2.3(e).

(i) _Divestiture Proceeds_. If, in accordance with its obligations under
Section 4.6, Purchaser shall be required to or have agreed to make any
Divestiture Sales, then from time to time upon the receipt of any
consideration in respect of assets that are or will be the subject of any
Divestiture Sale or any distributions or other proceeds received or retained
from such assets, but in no event later than promptly following the completion
of such Divestiture Sale (or upon the subsequent receipt of any such
consideration, distributions, or proceeds received following the completion
of any such Divestiture Sale in respect of such Divestiture Sale), Purchaser
shall pay to Seller in U.S. Dollars an amount equal to (i) with respect to a
Market Divestiture, the product of (A) the fair market value of
the consideration distributions or other proceeds received by Purchaser, the
Company or their Subsidiaries in such Market Divestiture net of all reasonable
costs and expenses, including applicable taxes (calculated using an assumed
combined U.S. federal and state tax rate of 35% with respect to taxable
income or gain recognized in such Divestiture Sale) and fees paid or required
to be paid with respect to such Divestiture Sale, and (B) the Market
Divestiture Proceeds Percentage and (ii) with respect to Spectrum
Divestitures, the product of (A) the fair market value of the consideration or
other proceeds received by Purchaser, the Company or their Subsidiaries in
such Spectrum Divestiture net of all reasonable costs and expenses, including

tax rate of 35% with respect to taxable income or gain recognized in such
Divestiture Sale) and fees paid or required to be paid with respect to such
Divestiture Sale, and (B) the Spectrum Divestiture Proceeds Percentage. If any
Divestiture Sale provides for potential post-closing indemnity or other
payments by the Company or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates) and such payments are actually made,
Seller agrees to reimburse Purchaser from time to time for any difference in
the amount that would have been paid to Seller pursuant to this Section 2.3(i)
if the proceeds of the Divestiture Sale had been reduced by the amount of
post-Closing indemnity or other payments. The provisions of this Section
2.3(i) shall not apply unless the Divestiture Adjustment Amount is greater
than $0.

 

(j) _Method of Payment, Interest, etc_. Any amount paid pursuant to Section
2.3(g) or 2.3(h) shall be (i) increased by interest on such amount,
compounded daily, at

 



20  an annual interest rate equal to 3%, from the Closing Date to and including
the date of payment based on a 365 day year, and (ii) made by wire transfer of
immediately available cash funds to an account designated by the receiving
party. Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, payments pursuant to
Section 2.3(g), 2.3(h) or 2.3(i) shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for income Tax purposes.

time and place as the parties may agree in writing. The " _Closing Date_ "
shall be the date upon which the Closing occurs.

Law. Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") with respect to its qualified status
under Section 401(a) of the Code or has pending or has time remaining in which

to provide any retiree health or life insurance benefits to any employee or
former employees of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

Material Adverse Effect, (A) there is no action, suit, audit or claim or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, proceeding or investigation pending against or
involving or threatened against or involving any Benefit Plan before any court
or arbitrator or any Governmental Entity, or federal, state or local official
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to subject
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a material liability, except those
first arising after the date hereof in the ordinary course of business and (B)
to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances existing
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to give
rise to such actions, suits, audits, claims or proceedings.

 

(v) There has been no amendment to or announcement by, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Benefit Plan that would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent fiscal year.

 

(vi) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transaction will (whether alone or in connection with any other event(s)):
(A) entitle any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay or any increase in severance pay (or other compensation or
benefits) upon any termination of employment; (B) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits under, or

 



27  increase the amount payable pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans; (C) limit
or restrict the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, after the
consummation of the Transaction, Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, to
merge, amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans (other than solely pursuant
to applicable Law); or (D) result in payments under any of the Benefit Plans
that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

(vii) No Benefit Plan provides any person with any amount of
additional compensation if such individual is provided amounts subject to
excise or additional taxes imposed under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.

(viii) Each Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"

being, conducted in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign law,
statute or ordinance, common law or any rule, regulation, guideline, standard,
judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency
requirement, license or permit of any Governmental Entity (collectively, "
_Laws_ "), except for violations that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is, to the Knowledge of the Company,
pending or threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention
to conduct the same, except for such investigations or reviews that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , that such exception shall not apply to
such investigations or reviews by the FCC or the Department of Justice. The
Company and its Subsidiaries each has obtained and is in compliance with all
permits, licenses, certifications, approvals, registrations, consents,
authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted
by a Governmental Entity (" _Licenses_ ") necessary to conduct its business

Material Adverse Effect (the " _Material Licenses_ "). 

(ii) Schedule 3.2(h)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list, as of the date hereof, of (A) all Material Licenses and, to

Licenses and State Licenses, the " _Communications Licenses_ "); (B) all
pending applications for Licenses that would be Communications Licenses if
issued or granted; and (C) all pending applications by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for modification, extension or renewal of any Communications
License. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with its
obligations under each of the FCC Licenses and the rules and regulations of
the FCC, and with its obligations under each of the FCC Licenses and
State Licenses, in each case, except for such failures to be in compliance
with Licenses that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there is not pending or threatened before the FCC, the Federal
Aviation Administration (the " _FAA_ ") or any other Governmental Entity any
proceeding, notice of violation, order of forfeiture or complaint or
investigation against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any
of the Communications Licenses, in each case, except that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The FCC actions granting all FCC Licenses, together
with all underlying construction permits, have not been reversed, stayed,
enjoined, annulled or suspended, and there is not pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened any application, petition, objection or other
pleading with the FCC, the FAA or any other Governmental Entity that
challenges or questions the validity of or any rights of the holder under any
such FCC License, in each case, except that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(iii) Except for immaterial matters, Seller validly holds the FCC Licenses
and the FCC Licenses are validly issued in the name of the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries. The FCC Licenses are in full force and effect and are free
and clear of all Encumbrances or any restrictions which might, individually or
in the aggregate, limit the full operation of the FCC Licenses in any
material respect.

(iv) All of the currently operating cell sites and microwave paths of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of which a filing with the FCC was
required have been constructed and are currently operated as represented to
the FCC in currently effective filings, and modifications to such cell sites
and microwave paths have been preceded by the submission to the FCC of all
required filings, in each case, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(v) All transmission towers owned or leased by the Company and its
Subsidiaries are obstruction-marked and lighted by the Company or its
Subsidiaries to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the rules and
regulations of the FAA (the " _FAA Rules_ "), except that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

 



29  likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Appropriate notification
to the FAA has been made for each transmission tower owned or leased by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent required to be made by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries by, and in accordance with, the FAA Rules, in each
case, except that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

(vi) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries holds any FCC Licenses
through a partnership, joint venture or other Person that is not a Subsidiary
of the Company.

(vii) The Company does not hold any License to offer, and does not offer, any

permit any inspection or disclose any information that in the reasonable

with respect to confidentiality if Seller, Global or its Subsidiaries, as

representatives such information concerning the Companys or any of its

reasonably request for its financial reporting purposes; _provided_ , that
the foregoing shall not require Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to permit any inspection or disclose any information that in the
reasonable judgment of Purchaser would result in the disclosure of any Trade
Secrets of third parties, violate any applicable Laws or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if Purchaser, the Company or its

requirement) or as otherwise expressly permitted hereunder.

 

4.4. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement,
Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall bear their
respective expenses, costs and fees (including attorneys, auditors and

preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and
compliance herewith, whether or not the Transaction is effected; _provided_ ,
that Seller shall be responsible for any attorneys, tax advisors and
financial advisors fees of the Company and its Subsidiaries incurred in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the

Closing.

4.6. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) Subject to Sections 4.6(b) and 4.6(c), Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate with each other and use, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their respective reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable
Laws to consummate the Transaction as promptly as reasonably practicable (it
being understood that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require
Purchaser to reach any agreements or understandings in connection with
obtaining any consents, approvals, permits or authorizations prior to a time
in advance of the Termination Date sufficient to permit satisfaction of the
conditions to the Closing by the Termination Date), including (i) preparing
and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation to effect
all necessary notices, reports and other filings (including by filing no later
than 10 days after the date hereof, the notification and required form under
the HSR Act, and by filing no later than 30 days after the date hereof, all
applications required to be filed with the FCC; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure to file within such 10 or 30 day period, as applicable, will not
constitute a breach of this Agreement); (ii) subject to the foregoing,
obtaining as promptly as reasonably practicable all consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate
the Transaction; (iii) furnishing all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Laws in
connection with the Transaction; (iv) keeping the other parties informed in
all material respects of any material communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case relating to the Transaction; (v) negotiating, proposing
and/or agreeing to Divestiture Sales and other actions, restrictions,
limitations or conditions required to obtain any consents, registrations,
approvals, permits or authorizations in connection with the Transaction; and
(vi) defending against the entry of any decree, order, or judgment that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including defending any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transaction. Without limiting the
foregoing and subject to Sections 4.6(b) and 4.6(c), prior to the Closing,
Seller and Purchaser shall not, and Seller shall cause Global and its
Subsidiaries not to, knowingly take any action, or knowingly fail to take any
action, that would reasonably be likely to materially delay or interfere with
the parties ability to consummate the Transaction.

 

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.6(b)(i) of the Purchaser Disclosure
Letter, nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require,
Purchaser or any of its

 



49  Subsidiaries to take or refrain from taking any action or to agree to any
restriction, limitation or condition with respect to (i) Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries or (ii) the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
that would, in the case of this clause (ii) only, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in aggregate adverse effects on
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries following the Closing (including the Company
and its Subsidiaries) being greater than the Material Adverse Amount (the
effects of clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Regulatory Material Adverse Condition_
"). For purposes hereof, the adverse effects resulting from (x) Divestiture
Sales shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the Divestitures Amount, (y)
the matters set forth on Schedule 4.6(b)(i) of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter
shall be deemed to be zero, and (z) all other conditions shall be deemed to
be 50% of the adverse effects (net of benefits) of such conditions. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the imposition of any conditions on
Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries containing any of the
terms set forth on Schedule 4.6(b)(ii) of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter
shall be deemed to be a Regulatory Material Adverse Condition. In no event
shall Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries be required to
agree to any Divestiture Sale or other action, restriction, limitation or
condition that is (A) effective prior to immediately before the Closing or (B)
effective immediately before the Closing and not conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Closing.

(c) Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to agree to
any actions, restrictions or conditions with respect to obtaining any
consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations in connection
with the Transaction without the prior written consent of Purchaser. Subject
to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Seller and
Purchaser shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all of the information relating to
Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transaction. To the extent permitted by Law, each party
shall provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it (or its
advisors) and any Governmental Entity relating to the Transaction and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, all telephone calls and meetings with a
Governmental Entity regarding the Transaction shall include representatives
of Seller and Purchaser. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Seller
and Purchaser shall act and Seller shall cause the Company to act reasonably
and as promptly as practicable.

 

4.7. _Financial Working Group_. Promptly after the date hereof, Seller and
Purchaser shall establish, and Seller shall cause the Company to designate
the appropriate employees to participate with employees of Purchaser in, a
joint working group to prepare for the integration of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing into Purchasers internal control
structure and procedures for financial reporting compliance with the
requirements of Rule 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Purchasers financial
reporting structure.

4.8. _Seller s Cooperation with Financing_. Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers, employees and representatives to, reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser and its representatives in connection with any financing by
Purchaser to be obtained in connection with the Transaction. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company,
its other

 



50  Subsidiaries and their respective representatives to, upon reasonable
request (a) furnish the report of the Companys auditor on the most recent
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such auditor to
the use of such report in accordance with normal custom and practice; (b)
furnish any additional financial statements, schedules or other financial
data relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably requested by
Purchaser; (c) furnish management and legal representatives of senior officers
of the Company to auditors; (d) make available the employees and advisors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide reasonable assistance with
Purchasers preparation of business projections, financing documents and offer
materials; (e) use reasonable efforts to obtain the cooperation and
assistance of counsel to the Company and its Subsidiaries in providing legal
opinions and other services; (f) assist in the preparation of one or more
confidential information memoranda and other marketing materials
reasonably requested by Purchaser; and (g) permit Purchasers reasonable use
of the Companys and its Subsidiaries logos for syndication of financing.

4.9. _Regulatory Compliance_.

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall, and Seller shall cause the Company and its
other Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cure no
later than the Closing any violations and defaults by any of them under any
applicable rules and regulations of the FCC (" _FCC Rules_ ") and the FAA
Rules, (ii) substantially comply with the terms of the FCC Licenses and the
FAA Rules, (iii) file or cause to be filed with the FCC and the FAA all
reports and other filings required to be filed under applicable FCC Rules and
FAA Rules, and (iv) take all reasonable actions requested in writing by
Purchaser on or before the Closing for each of them to be in compliance upon
the consummation of the Transaction with the provisions of Sections 271 and
272 of the Communications Act (including any orders issued by the FCC
interpreting or implementing such provisions).

 

(b) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
take such actions as are reasonably necessary to maintain and preserve the
Licenses and (ii) refrain from taking any action that would reasonably be
expected to cause the FCC or any other Governmental Entity with jurisdiction
over Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to institute proceedings
for the suspension, revocation or adverse modification of any Licenses.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, take such steps as are necessary to renew any expiring FCC
License, including preparing and filing with the appropriate Governmental
Entities all necessary applications in connection therewith as soon as
reasonably practicable after the commencement of the period during which such
applications may be made.

 

4.10. _Further Action_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Seller and Purchaser shall,
and Seller shall cause the Company and its other Subsidiaries to use their
reasonable best efforts to, take or cause to be taken all appropriate action,
to do or cause to be done all things necessary,

 



51  proper or advisable under applicable Law and to execute and deliver such
documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out the provisions
hereof and consummate the Transaction. 

(b) From time to time after the Closing, without additional consideration,
each party will (or, if appropriate, will cause its Subsidiaries to) execute
and deliver such further instruments and take such other action as may be
necessary or reasonably requested by another party to make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
upon reasonable request of Purchaser, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Company or its other Subsidiaries to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all
such further assurances, deeds, assignments, consequences, powers of attorney
and other instruments and papers as may be required to sell, transfer,
assign, convey and deliver to Purchaser all right, title and interest in and
to the Company Shares.

4.11. _Intercompany Arrangements_.

(a) Seller agrees that, not later than the Closing, all Intercompany
Indebtedness and all interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swaps
between the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
Seller and its Affiliates, on the other hand (including those of the type
described in note 15 to the most recent Financial Statements) shall be
settled, released and/or terminated without any continuing Liability to or
obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.11(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
Purchaser shall have the right to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
terminate without penalty on the Closing Date any Intercompany Contract;
_provided_ , that Purchaser shall provide notice to Seller at least 30 days
prior to the Closing Date of which such Intercompany Contracts it will
so terminate.

(c) At Purchasers election exercised by no later than 30 days prior to the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, extend for a
period of up to 12 months after the Closing any Intercompany Contracts (other
than those providing for Indebtedness for borrowed money or to the extent
relating to the matters set forth in Sections 4.21 or 4.22) that Purchaser
reasonably believes are reasonably necessary in connection with the continued
operation of the Business for a transitional period following the Closing.
Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, terminate any such
Intercompany Contracts without Purchasers written consent.

4.12. _Repayment of Indebtedness_. Seller shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries, at the Closing, to have no Closing Discharged Indebtedness.
Prior to the Closing, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not take, or cause to
be taken, any action with respect to Indebtedness for borrowed
money (including any current portion or on maturity thereof) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries other than the payment of interest in accordance with the
terms thereof, the extension and continuation of any principal amount thereof
that would otherwise be due and payable prior to the Closing, and the
discharge or forgiveness thereof without payment thereunder or creation of any
Liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



52 4.13. _Customer Communications_. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in
developing language for a program of communications or notices relating to
the Transaction to be sent to customers of the Company and its Subsidiaries on
or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing. Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, send any communications or notices relating to
the Transaction to customers of the Company and its Subsidiaries on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Closing without the prior written approval of
Purchaser, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

4.14. _Employee Matters_.

(a) Purchaser shall cause the Company for at least 12 months after the Closing
to provide or cause to be provided to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who are employed immediately after the Closing (" _Assumed
Employees_ ") compensation (other than equity compensation) and employee
benefit plans that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
compensation (other than equity compensation) and employee benefits provided
by the Company as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if during
this period Purchaser implements any widespread increase or decrease in
benefits under compensation and benefit plans or in the cost thereof
to participants under compensation and benefit plans applicable to employees
of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries), Purchaser may cause the Company to proportionately adjust the
benefits under its compensation and benefit plans or the cost thereof to
participants; _provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to employees who are
subject to a collective bargaining agreement, all benefits shall be provided
only in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated
as an amendment of any particular compensation and benefit plan provided by
the Company, (ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of
this Section 4.14, or (iii) obligate Purchaser, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries to (A) maintain any particular compensation and benefit plan
provided by the Company; or (B) retain the employment of any particular
employee.

(b) Following the Closing, each Assumed Employee shall receive service credit
to the extent credited under Benefit Plans prior to the Closing for all
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and level of
benefits for purposes of vacation, severance and paid time off (but not for
benefit accrual purposes, for the purpose of qualifying a subsidized early
retirement benefit, or as would result in a duplication of benefits) for the
same purposes under comparable employee benefit plans of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries in which such Assumed Employee participates following the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, none of the provisions
contained herein shall operate to require coverage of any Assumed Employee
under any benefit plan of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries. To the extent an
Assumed Employee participates in a welfare plan or arrangement of Purchaser
or a Subsidiary of Purchaser following the Closing (a " _Purchaser Welfare
Plan_ "), Purchaser and its Subsidiaries will to the extent legally
permissible cause all (i) pre-existing condition limitations which otherwise
would be applicable to such Assumed Employee and his or her covered dependents
to be waived to the extent satisfied under a Benefit Plan comparable to such
Purchaser Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing or, if later,
immediately prior to such Assumed Employees commencement of participation in
such Purchaser Welfare Plan and

 



53  (ii) participation waiting periods under each Purchaser Welfare Plan that
would otherwise be applicable to such Assumed Employee to be waived to the
same extent waived or satisfied under the Benefit Plan comparable to such
Purchaser Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing or, if later,
immediately prior to such Assumed Employees commencement of participation in
such Purchaser Welfare Plan. In addition, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries will
to the extent legally permissible honor or cause to be honored any
expenditures incurred by Assumed Employees and their covered dependents in
satisfying the deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under the
Benefit Plans during the portion of the applicable plan year that includes
the Closing in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket
maximums under any comparable Purchaser Welfare Plans in which they are
eligible to participate after the Closing for the portion of the applicable
plan year that includes the Closing.

(c) Prior to making any written or material oral communications to the
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to the effect of the Transaction on compensation or benefit
matters, the Company shall provide Purchaser with a copy of the
intended communication, Purchaser shall have a reasonable period of time to
review and comment on the communication and Purchaser and the Company shall
cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

 

(d) Within 30 days following the date hereof and in consultation with
Purchaser, Seller shall cause the Company to enter into a
retention arrangement for the benefit of the employees of the Company in
accordance with the terms set forth on Annex D.

(e) The Company shall perform (and in the event there is a successor to the
Company, such successor shall assume and perform) the obligations under the
Executive Continuity Bonus Plan and the obligations that survive termination
of the Phantom Share Plan and the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan.

4.15. _Minimum Cash Balance_. Seller shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries, at the Closing, to have no less than $100,000,000.00 of
cash on a consolidated basis.

commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
(a) operate their business consistent in all material respects with the
business plan set forth on Schedule 4.16 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, (b)
make capital expenditures consistent in all material respects with the capital
budget set forth in such business plan, and (c) make expenditures on marketing
and customer care activities consistent in all material respects with such
business plan, it being understood and agreed that the foregoing shall not in
any event constitute a guaranty or warranty as to future performance, or the
achievement of the business plan or any aspect of it or create any obligation
on the part of Seller to make new capital contributions or loans to the
Company.

4.17. _Additional Covenants of Purchaser_. During the period from the date
hereof to the Closing, Purchaser shall not:

(a) make, other than with respect to dividends on Purchaser Common Stock in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall include

 



54  any increases to dividends on Purchaser Common Stock consistent with past
practice), any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution with respect to any shares of Purchaser Common Stock (except for
dividends or other distributions by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary to Purchaser or to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Purchaser), or,
without the prior written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), any repurchase or other acquisition by Purchaser of
any outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock (other than repurchases or
other acquisitions by Purchaser of Purchaser Common Stock in open
market transactions at market prices or in connection with an accelerated
share repurchase transaction at market prices); or

(b) enter into any agreement to acquire another business or effect any
transaction that is reasonably likely to result in the failure to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Section 5.1(a) or 5.2(c).

 

4.18. _Purchaser Board of Directors_. Immediately following the Closing,
Purchaser shall cause Sellers Chief Executive Officer (or such other
designee of Seller satisfying the requirements of Section 3.1(b) of the
Stockholders Agreement, the governance guidelines of Purchaser, as in effect
from time to time, and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Board and the
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Purchaser), to
be appointed to the board of directors of Purchaser.

4.19. _Listing of Purchaser Shares_. Purchaser shall use its best efforts to
cause the Purchaser Shares to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject
only to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing.

4.20. _Potential Sale of Interests_. Between the date hereof and the Closing
(or earlier termination of this Agreement), to the extent reasonably
requested by Purchaser, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and its
other Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Purchaser to facilitate the disposition
immediately prior to and conditional upon the Closing or at or after the
Closing of those assets or ownership interests held by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that are identified by Purchaser in writing to Seller as
reasonably likely to be the subject of a transfer, sale or divesture
required in connection with obtaining a Governmental Consent (such assets or
interests referred to as a " _Potential Sale Interest_ "). To the extent
reasonably requested by Purchaser, Seller shall and shall cause the Company
and its other Subsidiaries to (a) permit Persons who Purchaser identifies to
Seller as potential purchasers of a Potential Sale Interest to conduct (and
cooperate with such Persons) reasonable investigations with respect to such
Potential Sale Interest ( _provided_ , that any such Person executes and
delivers to Seller a confidentiality agreement containing customary terms),
(b) comply with any applicable right of first refusal, right of first offer,
right of approval and similar provisions that may be applicable to a proposed
transfer of a Potential Sale Interest, and (c) deliver such notices, make such
filings and execute such contracts relating to the disposition of Potential
Sale Interest as reasonably requested by Purchaser; _provided_ , that none of
Seller, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to execute
any such contract under which Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
may be required to dispose of any Potential Sale Interest other than
immediately prior to and conditional upon the Closing or at or after the
Closing. Purchaser shall be permitted

 



55  to identify potential purchasers of Potential Sale Interests and negotiate
any contracts with respect to dispositions of Potential Sale Interests;
_provided_ , that Seller may (and, to the extent reasonably requested by
Purchaser, shall) participate in all such negotiations.

4.21. _Use of Trademarks_. Purchaser, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates (" _Licensed Parties_ ") shall have the right to use the
Business Marks for a period of 18 months following the Closing Date (the "
_Transition Period_ ") in order to effectuate a smooth and orderly transition
and rebranding for the Company and its Subsidiaries. In view of the foregoing,
Seller hereby grants to each of the Licensed Parties, to the extent of the
rights owned or controlled by Seller or any of its Affiliates, a non-
exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Business Marks during the
Transition Period in connection with their respective businesses, including
for the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of products and services.
The Licensed Parties may, to the extent of the rights owned or controlled by
Seller or any of its Affiliates, permit third parties to use the Business
Marks during the Transition Period, but only for and on behalf of the
Licensed Parties. Seller agrees that the provisions of this Section 4.21 may
be partially assigned for the benefit of a Person that acquires a Market
pursuant to a Market Divestiture, and the Transition Period in any such
case shall be for a period of 18 months following the closing of such Market
Divestiture or such longer period as may be required by a Governmental Entity
not to exceed 24 months. Prior to the Closing, Seller and the Company shall
cooperate to enter into a transitional trademark license agreement on terms
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and consistent with the license granted in,
and the other terms and conditions of, this Section 4.21, upon the
effectiveness of which the licenses and rights granted in this Section 4.21
shall terminate. Between the date hereof and the end of the Transition Period,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, not take any action, or fail
to take any action, that, in each case, would reasonably be expected to
materially limit or restrict the rights licensed under this Section 4.21 were
such license to be granted in respect of the period beginning on the date
hereof.

 

4.22. _Intellectual Property Licenses_. Except with respect to the matters
provided for in Section 4.21, with respect to any Intellectual Property owned
by Seller or any of its Affiliates that is used by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries otherwise has
any rights in, to or under prior to the Closing, which Intellectual Property
is not assigned to any of the Licensed Parties prior to or at the Closing,
Seller hereby grants to each of the Licensed Parties during the Transition
Period and for the territory of the United States, to the extent of
the rights owned or controlled by Seller or any of its Affiliates, a non-
exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free and fully paid-up right and license in,
to and under all such Intellectual Property, including the right to use,
reproduce, create derivative works, distribute, perform, display, exploit and
commercialize, and to practice under and to make, have made, use, sell, offer
for sale and import products and services. The Licensed Parties may, to the
extent of the license granted under this Section 4.22, permit third parties
to use such Intellectual Property during the Transition Period, but only for
and on behalf of the Licensed Parties. With respect to any Intellectual
Property licensed to Seller or any of its Affiliates by a third party, that
is used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries otherwise has any rights in, to or under prior to the
Closing, which licenses are not assigned to any of the Licensed Parties prior
to or at the Closing, Seller hereby grants to each of

 



56  the Licensed Parties, to the fullest extent permitted by the third party
licensors, during the Transition Period and for the territory of the United
States the continued right and license in, to and under such Intellectual
Property, including where so-permitted the right to use, reproduce, create
derivative works, distribute, perform, display, exploit and commercialize, and
to practice under and to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and
import products and services. Prior to the Closing, Seller and the Company
shall cooperate to enter into a transitional Intellectual Property license
agreement on terms reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and consistent with the
license granted in, and the other terms and conditions of, this Section 4.22,
upon the effectiveness of which the licenses and rights granted in this
Section 4.22 shall terminate. Between the date hereof and the end of the
Transition Period, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, not take
any action, or fail to take any action, that would limit or restrict the
rights licensed under this Section 4.22 were such license to be granted in
respect of the period beginning on the date hereof. 

4.23. _Covenant Not to Sue_. With respect to any Intellectual Property owned
by Seller or any of its Affiliates that is used by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries otherwise has
any rights in, to or under prior to the Closing, Seller hereby covenants and
agrees not to assert, and to cause each of its Affiliates not to assert, any
claim, nor initiate or participate in any suit, action or proceeding, against
any of the Licensed Parties for infringement, misappropriation, violation or
unauthorized use of such Intellectual Property in respect of any period prior
to the end of the Transition Period.

4.24. _Other Transition Arrangements_. Promptly following the date hereof
and subject to applicable Laws, Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate to
develop a procedure such that as of no later than the Closing Date, (x) the
Company, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries will not require in order
to conduct the Business, or have access to, any IT Assets, networks or
electronic data of Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and (y) Seller and its Subsidiaries will not have access to any
IT Assets, networks or electronic data of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries), in each case other than as
provided in Intercompany Contracts with obligations remaining on the Closing
Date.

 

4.25. _Confidentiality_. For a period of three years following the later of
the Closing and the date of disclosure, Seller and each of its Subsidiaries
shall treat as confidential and shall safeguard any and all confidential or
proprietary information, knowledge and data about the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Business by using the same degree of care, but no less
than a reasonable standard of care, to prevent the unauthorized use,
dissemination or disclosure of such information, knowledge and data as Seller
or its Subsidiaries used with respect thereto prior to the execution of this
Agreement.

 

4.26. _Indemnification and Insurance; Release_.

(a) Purchaser and the Company agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Closing, now existing in favor of the

 



57  current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of
the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective Organizational
Documents or in any agreement as in effect on the date hereof and which has
prior to the date hereof been made available to Purchaser shall survive the
Closing and shall continue in full force and effect to the extent provided in
the following sentence. Purchaser shall cause the Company to maintain in
effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries Organizational
Documents or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or
its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or former directors,
officers or employees, in each case in effect as of the date hereof and which
has been provided to Purchaser prior to the date hereof, for acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Closing. Each of Seller, Purchaser and the
Company, for and on behalf of itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby
acquits, releases and discharges each of the current or former directors and
officers of the Company from any and all Liabilities that arises out of or
are connected with such directors and officers position or services to the
Company on or prior to the Closing.

(b) In the event the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Company shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 4.26.

(c) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, for and on behalf of itself and on
behalf of its Subsidiaries, hereby acquits, releases and discharges each of
the Company and their Subsidiaries from any and all Liabilities as of the
Closing to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) that arise out of or are in connection with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, except in respect of obligations under Intercompany
Contracts or under this Agreement that are not terminated as of the Closing
Date (other than any arising out of or relating to a breach, violation or
failure to perform under any such Intercompany Contract). Seller shall cause
its other Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all appropriate action and to execute and deliver such documents
and other papers, as may be required to effect the release set forth in this
Section 4.26(c).

 

4.27. _Purchaser Common Stock_. During the period from the date hereof to the
Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with any other Person acquire,
offer to acquire or agree to acquire Beneficial Ownership of any shares of
Purchaser Common Stock.

 

4.28. _Subscriber List_.

(a) Promptly following the date hereof (but in any event within 60 days after
the date hereof), Seller shall cause the Company to prepare in good faith, or
cause to be prepared in good faith, and deliver to Purchaser a list setting
forth the total number of Subscribers in each Market as of December 31, 2010
(the " _Subscriber List_ "), which in the aggregate shall reflect the same
number of Subscribers as set forth in Schedule 3.2(q), including and
excluding the same

 



58  Subscribers as in Schedule 3.2(q). For purposes of the Subscriber List, a
Person shall be deemed to be a Subscriber "in" a particular Market if the
principal billing address for that Persons account contains a zip code
located in such Market. If a Person maintains multiple accounts, the
Subscribers billed on each such account shall be allocated into Markets on an
account-by-account basis based on the principal billing address zip code of
each such account. No Person shall be counted as a Subscriber "in" more than a
single Market, and Subscribers in zip codes that span more than one Market
shall be apportioned in the manner directed by a Governmental Entity or
otherwise equally between the relevant Markets.

(b) The Subscriber List shall become the final, binding and conclusive
Subscriber List on the 60th day following Purchasers receipt of the
Subscriber List unless on or prior to such 60th day Purchaser delivers to
Seller a written notice (a " _Subscriber List Dispute Notice_ ") stating
that Purchaser disputes one or more items contained in the Subscriber List
and specifying in reasonable detail each such disputed item.

(c) If Purchaser delivers a Subscriber List Dispute Notice, then Seller and
Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve the disputed items set forth
therein during the 60-day period beginning on the date Seller receives the
Subscriber List Dispute Notice. If Seller and Purchaser reach agreement with
respect to any disputed items, Seller shall revise the Subscriber List to
reflect such agreement. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve such
disputed items during such 60-day period, then, at the request of either
party, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly engage and submit the unresolved
disputed items to the Independent Accountant. Purchaser and Seller shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to issue
its written determination regarding such unresolved items within 45 days after
such items are submitted for review and in any event no later than the 75th
day after such submission. The Independent Accountant shall be instructed
that the total number of Subscribers shall be equal to the total number of
Subscribers set forth in Schedule 3.2(q) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
including and excluding the same Subscribers as in Schedule 3.2(q) and shall
make a determination with respect to such unresolved items only and in a
manner consistent with this Section 4.31. Each party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to furnish to the Independent Accountant such work papers and
other documents and information pertaining to such unresolved items as the
Independent Accountant may request. The determination of the Independent
Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive on Purchaser and Seller
absent manifest error. The fees, expenses and costs of the American
Arbitration Association and the Independent Accountant shall be borne in the
same proportion as the aggregate amount of such unresolved items that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each (as determined by the Independent Accountant)
bears to the total amount of such unresolved items submitted to the
Independent Accountant.

(d) Seller shall provide promptly to Purchaser and its representatives full
access to the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to any
other information and access to employees as Purchaser shall reasonably
request in connection with Purchasers review of the Subscriber List.

individually or in the aggregate, significant in relation to the magnitude of
the Transaction or to the parties required efforts to obtain Governmental
Consents.

(c) _Governmental Consents_. (i) All Governmental Consents, including those
required to be obtained from any PUCs or similar foreign regulatory body
regulating telecommunications business, but other than those described in
Section 5.1(a)(i) and clause (ii) of this Section 5.2(c), the failure of

the Purchaser Disclosure Letter (such Governmental Consents, together with
those Governmental Consents referenced in Section 5.1(a) and clause (i) of

Governmental Consents that have been obtained shall have been obtained without
the imposition of any term, condition, restriction or consequence that would,
individually or in the aggregate with all other terms, conditions,
restrictions or consequences imposed as a requirement to obtain other
Governmental Consents, reasonably be likely to have or result in a Regulatory
Material Adverse Condition and all Required Governmental Consents shall have

(B), (C) or (D) is reasonably likely to result in vacating, reversing, setting
aside, annulling, suspending or modifying such action or decision (in the case
of any modification in a manner that would impose any term, condition or
consequence that would reasonably be expected to have or result in a
Regulatory Material Adverse Condition).

 



61 (d) _No Company Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date hereof, there shall
not have occurred any change, event, circumstances or development that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company shall have issued to Purchaser a
certificate described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) to the
effect that the Company Shares are not "United States real property
interests" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(1) of the Code; _provided_ ,
that if the Company fails to deliver such certificate, Purchaser shall be
permitted to withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to Seller
pursuant to Section 2.2 any amounts required to be withheld pursuant to
Section 1445 of the Code.

5.3. _Conditions to Obligations of Seller_. The obligations of Seller to
effect the Transaction are also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by
Seller at or prior to the Closing of the following conditions:

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. (i) The representations and warranties
of Purchaser set forth in Section 3.3(j) (Purchaser Shares) shall be true and
correct in all material respects (A) on the date hereof and (B) at the Closing
(except to the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly
speaks as of a particular date, in which case such representation and
warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such date);
and (ii) the other representations and warranties of Purchaser set forth in
this Agreement shall be true and correct on the date hereof (except to the
extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of a
particular date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct as of such date); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the condition set forth in this Section
5.3(a)(ii) shall be deemed to have been satisfied even if any representations
and warranties of Purchaser are not so true and correct unless the failure of
such representations and warranties of Purchaser to be so true and correct
(read for purposes of this Section 5.3(a) without any materiality or Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect qualification), individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be likely to have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect; and (iii) Seller shall have received at the Closing a certificate
signed on behalf of Purchaser by an executive officer of Purchaser to the
effect that the condition set forth in this Section 5.3(a) has been
satisfied.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Purchaser_. Purchaser shall have performed
in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
this Agreement at or prior to the Closing, and Seller shall have received a
certificate signed by an executive officer of Purchaser to such effect; 
_provided_ , that this condition shall be deemed satisfied so long as any
failures to perform obligations under this Agreement are not, individually or
in the aggregate, significant in relation to the magnitude of the Transaction
or to the parties required efforts to obtain Governmental Consents.

(c) _No Purchaser Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date hereof, there
shall not have occurred any change, event, circumstances or development that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 



62 ARTICLE VI __

_Indemnification_

6.1. _Survival; Effect of Materiality Qualifiers_. 

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser contained in
Article III shall survive the Closing and will remain in full force and
effect until the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date, at which time
they will terminate (and no claims with respect to such representations and
warranties shall be made by any Person for indemnification thereafter),
except that the representations and warranties contained in (i) Section 3.2(k)
(Environmental Matters) and 3.2(s) (Prohibited Payments) shall survive the
Closing and remain in full force and effect until the date that is
three years after the Closing Date, (ii) Section 3.2(l) (Taxes) shall survive
the Closing and shall terminate 30 days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations and (iii) Sections 3.1(d) (Ownership of Global,
Holding and Company Shares), 3.2(b) (Capitalization) and 3.2(c)(ii)
(Subsidiary Equity Interests) (collectively, the " _Fundamental Seller
Representations_ ") and in Section 3.3(j) (Purchaser Shares) (collectively,
the " _Fundamental Purchaser Representations_ ") shall survive the Closing
until the date that is 10 years after the Closing Date. All covenants and
other agreements in this Agreement to the extent that by their terms are to be
performed prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing until the date that
is 12 months after the Closing Date, at which time they shall terminate (and
no claims with respect to such covenants and agreements shall be made by any
Person for indemnification thereafter) and all other covenants and agreements
in this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely.

(b) In determining whether any representation or warranty in this Agreement
was true and correct as of any particular date and the amount of any Damages
in respect of the failure of any such representation or warranty to be true
and correct as of any particular date, any qualification or limitation as to
materiality (whether by reference to material adverse effect or otherwise) or
knowledge contained in such representation or warranty shall be disregarded
(other than in the case of the representation and warranty contained in
Section 3.2(o)(i)(J), as to which such qualifications and limitations shall
not be disregarded).

6.2.  _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and save and hold
harmless Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from
and against any and all demands, claims, actions or causes of action,
assessments, losses, damages, liabilities, diminution in value, costs and
expenses, including interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses, in each case on a basis net of any actual benefit (" _Damages_ "),
resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection with: (i) any
failure of any representation or warranty made by Seller to be true and
correct or any nonfulfillment, violation or breach of the covenant set forth
in Section 4.16 (Business Plan; Capital Expenditures); (ii) any
nonfulfillment, violation or breach of any covenant or agreement made by
Seller in this Agreement (other than Section 4.16 (Business Plan; Capital
Expenditures)), in each case existing as of the Closing; and (iii) Excluded 

 



63  Liabilities; _provided_ , that, without derogation of any right to
indemnification hereunder with respect to any breach of the representations
and warranty contained in Section 3.2(e) ( _Financial Statements; Undisclosed
Liabilities_ ), Damages resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in
connection with any failure of any representation or warranty made by Seller
in Section 3.2(l) to be true and correct shall be limited to Pre-Closing
Taxes resulting from, arising out of or incurred in connection with such
breach. The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to assert any
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(i) after the expiration of
the applicable survival period referenced in Section 6.1; _provided_ , that
if on or prior to such expiration of the applicable survival period a notice
of claim shall have been given to Seller pursuant to Section 6.3 for
such indemnification, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall continue to have the
right to be indemnified with respect to the matter or matters to which such
claim relates until such claim for indemnification has been satisfied or
otherwise resolved. 

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify and save and hold
harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors
and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against
any and all Damages resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection
with: (i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser to
be true and correct; and (ii) any nonfulfillment, violation or breach of any
covenant or agreement made by Purchaser in this Agreement, in each case
existing as of the Closing. The Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
assert any indemnification pursuant to Section 6.2(b)(i) after the expiration
of the applicable survival period with respect to inaccuracies in or breaches
of the representations and warranties of Purchaser referenced in Section 6.1;
_provided_ , that if on or prior to such expiration of the applicable survival
period a notice of claim shall have been given to Purchaser pursuant to
Section 6.3 for such indemnification, the Seller Indemnitees shall continue
to have the right to be indemnified with respect to the matter or matters to
which such claim relates until such claim for indemnification has been
satisfied or otherwise resolved.

 

6.3. _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) If an indemnified party shall desire to assert any claim for
indemnification provided for under this Article VI in respect of, arising out
of, or involving a claim or demand made by any Person (other than a party
hereto or Affiliate thereof) against the indemnified party (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), such indemnified party shall notify Purchaser or Seller, as the
case may be (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), in writing of such Third-Party
Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of Damages sought thereunder to the
extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final
amount of such Third-Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any
relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any
other material details pertaining thereto (a " _Third-Party Claim Notice_ ")
promptly after receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the
Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to provide a Third-
Party Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have
been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnified party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the indemnified
partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ ,

 



64  that failure to provide any such copies shall not affect the indemnification
obligations provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses and acknowledges without reservation its obligation to
indemnify the indemnified party therefore, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall not be entitled to assume the defense
of any Third-Party Claim by a Taxing Authority to the extent that such
defense cannot be severed from a proceeding by the same Taxing Authority
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or after the Closing Date. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party will not be liable to the indemnified party for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof, unless the Third-Party Claim involves potential conflicts of
interest or substantially different defenses for the indemnified party and the
Indemnifying Party, in which case the Indemnifying Party will be liable to the
indemnified party for the expenses of one counsel and, if necessary, local
counsel. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the indemnified party
shall have the right to participate in defense thereof and to employ counsel,
at its own expense (except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence), separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of one
counsel and, if necessary, local counsel, employed by the indemnified party
for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the
defense thereof and as otherwise contemplated by the two immediately preceding
sentences. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third-Party Claim,
the other party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and the use of
reasonable efforts to make employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any
Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-
Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying
Party may pay, settle or compromise a Third-Party Claim without the written
consent of the indemnified party, so long as such settlement includes (i) an
unconditional release of the indemnified party from all Liability in respect
of such Third-Party Claim; (ii) does not subject the indemnified party to any
injunctive relief or other equitable remedy; and (iii) does not include a
statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on
behalf of any indemnified party; _provided_ , that in the case of a Third-
Party Claim by a Taxing Authority, Seller shall not pay, settle or compromise
such claim without the written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not
be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld) to the extent such Third-
Party Claim would reasonably be expected to result in an increase in the Tax
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything in this agreement to the contrary:

 



65  (i) Seller shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third-Party
Claim by a Taxing Authority to the extent that such defense cannot be severed
from a proceeding by the same Taxing Authority relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
after the Closing Date; (ii) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts
to sever any such Third-Party Claim by a Taxing Authority in such a manner as
would permit Seller to control such claim; (iii) in the event that clause (i)
of this sentence prohibits Seller from controlling any Third-Party Claim by a
Taxing Authority, then (A) Seller may retain separate co-counsel at its sole
cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim
(including participation in any relevant meetings and conference calls during
which the discussion can be limited to the issue or issues that result in
such Third-Party Claim), (B) Purchaser shall keep Seller informed on a timely
basis of all developments and events relating to such Third-Party Claim
(including promptly forwarding copies to Seller of any related correspondence
with any material related to unrelated issues redacted), and (C) Purchaser
shall not enter into any settlement with respect to any such Third-Party Claim
without Sellers prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld; and (iv) in the event that Seller controls
a Third-Party Claim by a Taxing Authority that would reasonably be expected to
result in an increase in the Tax liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or after
the Closing Date, (A) Purchaser may retain separate co-counsel at its sole
cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim
(including participation in any relevant meetings and conference calls), (B)
Seller shall keep Purchaser informed on a timely basis of all developments and
events relating to such Third-Party Claim (including promptly forwarding
copies to Purchaser of any related correspondence), and (C) Seller shall not
enter into any settlement with respect to any such Third-Party Claim without
Purchasers prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld.

 

(c) If an indemnified party shall desire to assert any claim for
indemnification provided for under this Article VI other than a claim in
respect of, arising out of, or involving a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct
Claim_ "), such indemnified party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party
in writing of such Direct Claim, the amount or the estimated amount
of Damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate
shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Direct Claim), any other
remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and,
to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto (a "
_Direct Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give
such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided for hereunder
except to the extent the indemnified party shall have maliciously failed to
give such notice and the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have a
period of 30 days within which to respond to any Direct Claim Notice or any
Third-Party Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party does not respond within
such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted
such claim. If the Indemnifying Party rejects all or any part of such claim,
Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith for 30 days to resolve such
claim. If no such agreement can be reached through good faith negotiation
within 30 days, either Purchaser or Seller may commence an action
in accordance with Section 8.3.

 



66 6.4. _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a)(i) Seller shall have no liability for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(i) if the Damages for which the Indemnifying Party
would be responsible for such claim and all related claims are less than the
applicable De Minimis Amount. Seller shall have no liability for
indemnification pursuant to (i) Section 6.2(a)(i) with respect to Damages
for which indemnification is provided thereunder unless (A) the aggregate
amount of such Damages (excluding all Damages associated with claims less than
the applicable De Minimis Amount) for a claim and all related claims with
respect to the particular representation being evaluated exceeds the
Specified Deductible, if applicable, and (B) the aggregate amount of such
Damages (excluding all Damages associated with claims less than the applicable
De Minimis Amount and excluding all Damages to the extent less than the
Specified Deductible, if applicable, and including any Damages in excess
thereof) exceeds $500,000,000.00 (the " _Threshold_ "), in which case Seller
shall be liable for all such Damages (excluding all Damages associated with
claims less than the applicable De Minimis Amount and excluding all Damages to
the extent less than the Specified Deductible, applicable, and including any
Damages in excess thereof); and (ii) Section 6.2(a)(iii) with respect to
Damages for which indemnification is provided thereunder unless the aggregate
amount of such Damages exceeds $15,000,000.00; _provided_ , that the
cumulative aggregate liability for all Damages pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(i)
shall not exceed an amount equal to $9,750,000,000.00 (the " _Seller Cap_ ").
The limitations in this Section 6.4(a) shall not apply to any Damages as a
result of inaccuracies in the Fundamental Seller Representations, and any
such Damages shall not be counted in determining the Threshold or the Seller
Cap.

(ii) " _De Minimis Amount_ " shall mean: (1) $5,000,000.00 with respect to the
failure of representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Sections
3.2(f) (Litigation), 3.2(k) (Environmental Matters) or 3.2(n) (Intellectual
Property) to be true and correct; and (2) $1,000,000.00 with respect to the
failure of all other representations and warranties of Seller to be true and
correct.

 

(iii) " _Specified Deductible_ " shall mean: (1) $5,000,000.00 in the
aggregate with respect to all failures of the representations and warranties
of Seller set forth in Section 3.2(j) (Insurance) to be true and correct; (2)
$10,000,000.00 in the aggregate with respect to all failures of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 3.2(n)
(Intellectual Property) to be true and correct; (3) $15,000,000.00 in the
aggregate each with respect to all failures of the representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in Section 3.2(h)(i) (Compliance with Laws)
and Section 3.2(i) (Absence of Certain Changes) to be true and correct; (4)
$25,000,000.00 in the aggregate each with respect to all failures of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section
3.2(f) (Litigation), Section 3.2(k) (Environmental Matters), Section 3.2(o)
(Material Contracts) and Section 3.2(p) (Sufficiency and Ownership of Assets;
Business) to be true and correct; and (5) $50,000,000.00 in the aggregate
with respect to all failures of the representations and warranties of Seller
set forth in Section 3.2(e)(ii) (Undisclosed Liabilities) to be true and
correct.

 



67 (iv) Notwithstanding the $5,000,000.00 De Minimis Amount applicable to
the failure of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in
Section 3.2(k) (Environmental Matters), Damages for a claim and all related
claims in connection with such failure in excess of $1,000,000.00 shall be
counted in determining whether the Specific Deductible applicable to the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 3.2(k)
(Environmental Matters) has been exceeded.

(b) Purchaser shall have no liability for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.2(b)(i) if the Damages for which the Indemnifying Party
would be responsible for such claim and all related claims are less than the
De Minimis Amount. Purchaser shall have no liability for indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.2(b)(i) with respect to Damages for which
indemnification is provided thereunder unless the aggregate amount of
such Damages (excluding all Damages associated with claims less than the De
Minimis Amount) exceeds the Threshold, in which case Purchaser shall be liable
for all such Damages (excluding all Damages associated with claims less than
the De Minimis Amount); _provided_ , that the cumulative aggregate liability
for all Damages pursuant to Section 6.2(b)(i) shall not exceed an amount equal
to the product of (i) $39,000,000,000.00 _less_ the Cash Consideration
(including as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2(c)), _multiplied_ by (ii) 0.25
(the " _Purchaser Cap_ "). The limitations in this Section 6.4(b) shall not
apply to any Damages as a result of inaccuracies in the Fundamental Purchaser
Representations, and any such Damages shall not be counted in determining the
Threshold or the Purchaser Cap.

6.5.  _Indemnity Payments_.

(a) In calculating the amount of any Damages, the proceeds actually received
by the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance policy
or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any
other Person, net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums incurred in
connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted,
except to the extent that the adjustment itself would excuse, exclude or limit
the coverage of all or part of such Damages. In the event that an indemnified
party has any rights against a third party with respect to any Damages that
results in a payment by an Indemnifying Party under this Article VI, such
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to such rights to the extent of such
payment; _provided_ , that until the indemnified party recovers full payment
of the Damages, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any such
third party on account of said indemnity payment is hereby expressly made
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the indemnified partys rights
against such third party. Without limiting the generality or effect of any
other provision hereof, each indemnified party and Indemnifying Party shall
duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and
perfect the subrogation and subordination rights detailed herein and
otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims. Except to the extent
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code, the parties to this Agreement shall treat any
indemnification payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
purchase price for income Tax purposes.

 



68 (b) If an indemnified party recovers an amount from a third party in respect
of Damages that is the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a
portion of such Damages has been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Article VI, the indemnified party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Damages _plus_ the amount received from
the third party in respect thereof _minus_ (ii) the full amount of Damages.

 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to this
Article VI, by wire transfer of immediately available cash funds, promptly
following receipt from an indemnified party of a bill for Damages that are the
subject of indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party in good
faith disputes the Damages, in which event it shall so notify the
indemnified party. In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
indemnified party, by wire transfer in immediately available cash funds, the
amount of any Damages for which it is liable hereunder no later than three
days following any determination of such Damages and the Indemnifying Partys
liability therefor. A "determination" shall exist when (i) the parties to the
dispute have reached an agreement, (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction
shall have entered an order or judgment, or (iii) an arbitration or like
panel shall have rendered a final binding, non-appealable determination with
respect to disputes the parties have agreed to submit thereto.

 

6.6. _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, following the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and
its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates
against Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors and Affiliates, and vice versa, for any Damages resulting from,
arising out of, or incurred in connection with, this Agreement shall be the
indemnification and other rights specifically set forth in this Article VI and
otherwise in this Agreement, and no Person shall have any monetary rights or
claims against Purchaser, Seller, their respective Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors and Affiliates under this Agreement, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of Purchaser, Seller, their
respective Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and
Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation resulting from,
arising out of, or incurred in connection with, this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this Section 6.6 shall apply to tort claims under applicable
Law based on fraud or to either partys rights to seek equitable remedies.

the Transaction may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing by mutual
written consent of Purchaser and Seller.

7.2. _Termination by Either Purchaser or Seller_. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Transaction may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing by either Purchaser or Seller if (a) the Transaction shall not have
been consummated by March 20, 2012; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
condition set forth in Section 5.1(a) or 5.2(c) shall not have been satisfied
by

 



69  March 20, 2012, either party may extend the Termination Date from time to
time to a date not later than June 20, 2012, and if not satisfied by such
date, either party may further extend the Termination Date from time to time
to a date not later than September 20, 2012 upon provision of a certificate
executed by an executive officer of such party that such party believes in
good faith that the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Sections
5.1(a) and 5.2(c) is meaningfully possible to occur prior to such extended
date (such date as may be extended from time to time pursuant to this Section
7.2, the " _Termination Date_ "); or (b) any Order permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Transaction shall
become final and non-appealable.

7.3. _Termination by Seller_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transaction may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing by Seller if
there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by Purchaser in this Agreement, or any such representation and
warranty shall have become untrue after the date hereof, such that Section
5.3(a) or 5.3(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not
curable.

7.4. _Termination by Purchaser_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transaction may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing by Purchaser if
there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
made by Seller in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty

5.2(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable.

7.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Transaction pursuant to this Article VII, this Agreement (other than Sections
4.4 (Expenses), 7.5(b) (Termination Transfer), 7.5(c) (Exclusive Remedy) and
8.1 through 8.5 and 8.7 through 8.13 (Miscellaneous)) shall become void and of
no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other
representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , except as otherwise provided
herein, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability
or damages resulting from any willful breach of this Agreement.

(b) If (i) Seller or Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.2 or (ii) Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3 following
an intentional failure in bad faith by Purchaser to comply with its
obligations under Section 4.6, and, in each of (i) and (ii), at the time of
such termination, the conditions set forth in Section 5.1(a), 5.1(b) or 5.2(c)
shall not have been satisfied, and at the time of such termination, all other
conditions to the Closing set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 shall have been
satisfied or waived (other than the condition set forth in Section 5.1(c), and
other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing but which conditions would be satisfied or, in the case of Section
5.2(e), would be capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date
of such termination, or those conditions that have not been satisfied as a
result of a breach by Purchaser), then (i) Purchaser shall (A) within three
Business Days following receipt of such written notice, pay to Seller the cash
amount set forth on Annex E by wire transfer of immediately available funds 

 



70  and (B) deliver to, or as directed by, Seller the assets set forth on Annex
E (the " _Termination Transfer_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the expiration of the waiting period (and any extensions thereof)
applicable to the transfer of the assets included in the Termination Transfer
under the HSR Act and receipt of any required consents, registrations,
approvals, permits, clearances or authorizations required to be obtained by
Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Affiliates, from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transfer of
the assets included in the Termination Transfer;  _provided_ , that Seller
and Purchaser shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use,
their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or
advisable on their respective parts under this Agreement and applicable Laws
to consummate such transfer of assets as promptly as practicable; and (ii)

73 8.5. _Entire Agreement; No Other Representations_. This Agreement (including
any annexes and exhibits hereto), the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Purchaser
Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement and, when executed, the
Stockholders Agreement, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Each of Purchaser and Seller acknowledges that the other party has not made
any representation, express or implied, with respect to the accuracy,
completeness or adequacy of any available information except to the extent
such information is specifically covered by the representations and warranties
of the other party contained in Article III or Section 8.12.

8.6. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any of the
Chosen Courts, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity.

 

8.7. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, except to the extent contemplated by Sections 4.26 and 6.2.

8.8. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity
or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,
or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

8.9. _Interpretation_. The table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions
hereof. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event that an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

 

8.10. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the
benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. Neither party may directly or
indirectly assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under
this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of the other party, except as set forth in Section 4.21 (Use
of Trademarks) and

 



74  Section 4.22 (Intellectual Property Licenses). Any purported direct or
indirect assignment in violation of this Section 8.10 shall be null and void
_ab initio_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may assign any of its
rights and/or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement to one or
more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (but no such assignment shall relieve
Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder). 

8.11. _Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, neither Seller, Purchaser, their respective
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers, directors or Affiliates
shall be liable to any Person under this Agreement for any special,
consequential, punitive, indirect or exemplary damages (including lost
or anticipated revenues or profits relating to the same) arising from any
claim relating to this Agreement (other than to the extent such damages are
paid to a third party), whether such claim is based on warranty, contract,
tort (including negligence or strict liability) or otherwise.

8.12. _Securities Matters_. Each of Purchaser and Seller represents and
warrants to the other party as follows:

(a) _Experience; Risk_. Such party has such knowledge, sophistication and
experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of the receipt of the Company Shares or the Purchaser
Shares, respectively, and of protecting its interests in connection herewith.
Seller has the ability to bear the economic risk of this investment,
including complete loss of the investment.

(b) _Investment_. Such party is acquiring the Company Shares or the Purchaser
Shares, respectively, for investment for its own account, not as a nominee or
agent, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof, and has no present intention of selling, granting any
participation in or otherwise distributing the same. Such party understands
that the Company Shares or the Purchaser Shares, respectively, have not been
registered under the Securities Act, by reason of a specific exemption from
the registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among
other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy
of such partys representations as expressed in this Section 8.12.

 

(c) _Access to Information_. Such party acknowledges that, as of the date
hereof, it has been afforded (i) the opportunity to ask such questions as it
has deemed necessary of, and to receive answers from, representatives of the
other party concerning the terms and conditions of the Transaction and the
Company Shares or the Purchaser Shares, respectively, and the merits
and risks of investing in the Company Shares or the Purchaser Shares,
respectively, and any such questions have been answered to such partys
reasonable satisfaction; (ii) access to information about the Company or
Purchaser, respectively, and its financial condition, results of operations,
business, properties, management and prospects sufficient to enable it to
evaluate its investment; (iii) the opportunity to obtain such additional
information that the other party possesses or can acquire without
unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to make an informed
investment decision with respect to the investment and any such additional
information has been provided to such partys reasonable satisfaction;
and (iv) the opportunity to ask

 



75  questions of management of the other party and any such questions have been
answered to such partys reasonable satisfaction. Such party has sought such
accounting, legal and tax advice as it has considered necessary to make an
informed decision with respect to its acquisition of the Company Shares or the
Purchaser Shares, respectively. Each party hereto acknowledges that no other
party hereto nor any Affiliate or representative of such party has made any
representation, express or implied, with respect to the accuracy, completeness
or adequacy of any available information except or to the extent such
information is covered by the representations and warranties
contained herein. Except as expressly provided in Section 6.2(b), Seller
hereby agrees that neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will have or be
subject to any Liability or indemnification obligation to Seller or to any
other Person resulting from the issuance and sale of Purchaser Shares to
Seller.

(d) _Accredited Investor_. Such party is an "accredited investor" within the
meaning of Regulation D, Rule 501(a), promulgated by the SEC.

(e) _Restricted Securities; Rule 144_. Such party understands that the
Company Shares and the Purchaser Shares, respectively, are characterized as
"restricted securities" under the U.S. federal securities laws inasmuch as
they are being acquired from the other party in a transaction not involving a
public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations the
Purchaser Shares may be resold without registration under the Securities Act
only in certain limited circumstances. Such party acknowledges that the
Company Shares or the Purchaser Shares, respectively, must be held
indefinitely unless a sale of such Company Shares or Purchaser Shares,
respectively, is subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an
exemption from such registration is available. Such party is aware of the
provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act which permit
limited resale of shares purchased in a private placement or shares owned by
certain Persons associated with the Company subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions.

(f) _Legends_. Seller understands and agrees that each certificate
representing the Purchaser Shares, any securities issued in respect thereof
or exchange therefor shall bear a legend in the following forms (in addition
to any other legend required under applicable state securities laws) (and a
comparable notation or other arrangement will be made with respect to any
uncertificated Purchaser Shares):

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED. SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
REGISTRATION OR UNLESS THE ISSUER RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY
ACCEPTABLE TO IT STATING THAT SUCH SALE OR TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM THE
REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT."

 



76 "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS
OF A STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF MARCH 20, 2011, TO WHICH THE ISSUER
AND CERTAIN OF ITS STOCKHOLDERS ARE PARTY, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE INSPECTED AT
THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE ISSUER OR OBTAINED FROM THE ISSUER WITHOUT
CHARGE." 

8.13. _Transfer Taxes_. Any Transfer Taxes shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and
50% by Seller. The party so required by applicable Law shall file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all Transfer
Taxes, and, if required by the applicable Law, the other parties shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to join in the execution of any such Tax Returns
and other documentation.

 



77 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
parties hereto as of the date first written above.
