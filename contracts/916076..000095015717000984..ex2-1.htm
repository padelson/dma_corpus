Inventory, in accordance with the definitions as provided in this Agreement
and the Accounting Methodology and (ii) not include any changes in assets or
liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes
arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The post‑Closing purchase price adjustment as set forth in this
_Section 1.6(b)_ is not intended to permit the introduction of different
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, classifications,
conventions, categorizations, definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions,
techniques or estimation methods with respect to financial statements
(including any of the foregoing as they relate to the nature of accounts,
calculation of levels of reserves or levels of accruals) from the Accounting
Methodology or the accounts used and included in determining the amount of the
Target Net Working Capital.

  


 

  

(c) _Dispute Resolution Procedures_.

  

  

  

 

3  

  


 

  

(i) If the Seller Representative disagrees with Buyer's calculation of the
Purchase Price or any component thereof, including the calculation of the
aggregate amount of the Cash and Cash Equivalents of Panadero Corp and its
Subsidiaries, the calculation of the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of
Panadero Corp and its Subsidiaries, Net Working Capital, or Transaction
Expenses as set forth in the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to _Section
1.6(b)_ , the Seller Representative may, within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to Buyer providing
reasonable detail of the reasons for such disagreement and setting forth the
Sellers' calculation of the items and amounts in dispute. Any such notice of
disagreement shall specify all items or amounts as to which the Seller
Representative disagrees, and the Seller Representative shall be deemed to
have agreed with all other items and amounts, and the calculation thereof, set
forth in the Closing Statement.

  


 

  

(ii) If a notice of disagreement shall be properly delivered pursuant to
_Section 1.6(c)(i)_ , the Seller Representative and Buyer shall, during the
fifteen (15) days following such delivery, negotiate in good faith to reach
written agreement on the disputed items or amounts. The matters set forth in
any written resolution executed by the Seller Representative and Buyer shall
be final and binding on the parties on the date of such written resolution. If
the Seller Representative and Buyer are unable to reach such agreement during
such fifteen (15) day period, they shall promptly (and in any event, within
thirty (30) days) thereafter submit any matters in dispute to Alvarez and Marsal
or, if such firm declines to act, another nationally recognized public
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the Seller Representative
(the " _Valuation Firm_ ") for resolution.

  


 

  

(iii) The Valuation Firm shall make a final and binding determination with
respect to the computation of the Purchase Price, including each of the
components thereof, to the extent such amounts are in dispute, in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and on _Exhibit
C_. Buyer and the Seller Representative shall cooperate with the Valuation
Firm during the term of its engagement and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Valuation Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements
with respect to the computation of the Purchase Price, including each of the
components thereof, as soon as practicable. The Valuation Firm shall consider
only those items and amounts in Buyer's and the Seller Representative's
respective calculations of the Purchase Price, including each of the
components thereof, that are identified as being items and amounts to which
Buyer and the Seller Representative have been unable to agree. In resolving
any disputed item, the Valuation Firm may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Valuation
Firm's determination of the Purchase Price, including each of the components
thereof, shall be based solely on written materials submitted by Buyer and the
Seller Representative (i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions
included herein. The determination of the Valuation Firm shall be conclusive
and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or
further review.

  


 

  

(iv) The costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm in determining the Purchase
Price, including each of the components thereof, shall be borne by Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the
other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by
such party. For example, if Buyer claims the Purchase Price is one thousand
dollars ($1,000) less than the amount determined by the Seller Representative,
and the Seller Representative contests only five hundred dollars ($500) of the
amount claimed by Buyer, and if the Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding Buyer three hundred dollars ($300) of the five hundred
dollars ($500) contested, then the costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm
will be allocated sixty percent (60%) (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Seller
Representative and forty percent (40%) (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Buyer. Prior to
the Valuation Firm's determination of the Purchase Price, (i) Buyer, on the
one hand, and the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the
other hand, shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of any retainer paid to the
Valuation Firm and (ii) during the engagement of the Valuation Firm, the
Valuation Firm will bill fifty percent

  

  

  

 

4  

  

  

  

(50%) of the total charges to each of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the other hand. In connection
with the Valuation Firm's determination of the Purchase Price, the Valuation
Firm shall also determine, pursuant to the terms of the first and second
sentences of this _Section 1.6(c)(iv)_, and taking into account all fees and
expenses already paid by each of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the other hand, as of the date
of such determination, the allocation of its fees and expenses between Buyer
and the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), which such
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

  


 

  

(v) The Closing Statement (and each of the components thereof) shall become
final and binding on the parties (A) on the thirty-first (31st) day following
the delivery of the Closing Statement if a notice of disagreement has not been
delivered to Buyer by the Seller Representative, (B) with such changes as are
necessary to reflect matters resolved pursuant to any written resolution
executed pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)(ii)_ , on the date such resolution is
executed, if all outstanding matters are resolved through such resolution,
and/or (C) with such changes as are necessary to reflect the Valuation Firm's
resolution of the matters in dispute (together with any changes necessary to
reflect matters previously resolved pursuant to any written resolution
executed pursuant to this Agreement and any matters not disputed pursuant to a
notice of disagreement), on the date the Valuation Firm delivers its final,
binding resolution pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)(ii)_ (the Closing Statement in
such form, the " _Final Closing Statement_ ," and the Purchase Price set forth
in the Final Closing Statement, the " _Final Purchase Price_ ").

  


 

  

(d) _Final Payment_. Upon finalization of the Final Closing Statement as
provided in _Section 1.6(c)_ :

  


 

  

(i) If the Final Purchase Price exceeds or is equal to the Estimated Purchase
Price, (x) the Seller Representative shall be entitled to retain without
restriction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions of
_Section 1.6(f)_ hereof) the Seller Holdback Amount (for further distribution
by the Seller Representative to each Seller according to their Allocable
Portion, and, if applicable, in accordance with the Panadero Aggregates LLC
Agreement), and (y) if the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase
Price, Buyer shall as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days following the final determination of the Purchase Price as
provided in _Section 1.6(c)_ , pay or cause to be paid to the Seller
Representative (for further distribution by the Seller Representative to each
Seller according to their Allocable Portion, and, if applicable, in accordance
with the Panadero Aggregates LLC Agreement), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account(s) designated in writing by the Seller
Representative, an amount in cash equal to the amount by which Final Purchase
Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price.

  


 

  

(ii) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price, then
the Seller Representative shall, from the Seller Holdback Amount, release to
Buyer (on behalf of the Sellers, according to each Seller's Allocable Portion,
if applicable) the lesser of (x) the amount by which the Estimated Purchase
Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price and (y) the Seller Holdback Amount;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the Seller Holdback Amount is greater than
the amount by which the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase
Price, then the portion of the Seller Holdback Amount remaining following such
release to Buyer shall be retained by the Seller Representative (for further
distribution by the Seller Representative to each Seller according to their
Allocable Portion, and, if applicable, in accordance with the Panadero
Aggregates LLC Agreement) without restriction (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the restrictions of _Section 1.6(f)_ hereof).

  


 

  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, except with respect to the Seller Holdback
Amount, neither the Seller Representative, any Seller, nor any of their
respective Affiliates or any of their respective managers, officers,
directors, employees, advisors, consultants, agents or representatives shall

  

  

  

 

5  

  

  

  

have any liability or obligation under this _Section 1.6_ or otherwise for any
amount by which the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price.
Recovery from the Seller Holdback Amount shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy available to Buyer or any of its Affiliates against the Seller
Representative or any of the Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates or
otherwise, arising out of or relating to any amount by which the Estimated
Purchase Price exceeds the Purchase Price and neither Buyer, the Companies nor
any of their respective Affiliates shall have any claim against the Seller
Representative, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or any of
their respective managers, officers, directors, employees, advisors,
consultants, agents or representatives in respect thereof.

  


 

  

(f) Until the final determination of the Final Purchase Price and any payment
required to be made to Buyer in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 1.6_ , if any, the Seller Representative shall not distribute, make
any payments or otherwise dispose any portion of the Seller Holdback Amount.

  


 

  

(g) The parties hereto (i) shall, and shall cause their respective
representatives to, cooperate and (ii) shall make available to one another and
their respective employees and representatives and, if applicable, the
Valuation Firm, to the extent necessary, at reasonable times and with
reasonable advance notice, such books, Contracts, records, work papers and
appropriate personnel and other information (including work papers, and
outside advisors) as any of the foregoing may reasonably request, in each
case, to prepare and review the Closing Statement (including the calculation
of Cash and Cash Equivalents of Panadero Corp and its Subsidiaries,
Indebtedness of Panadero Corp and its Subsidiaries, Net Working Capital, and
Transaction Expenses), and/or any matters in dispute (including those
submitted to the Valuation Firm). Buyer, the Companies and the Sellers each
acknowledge and waive any actual or potential conflict of employees of the
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries assisting the Seller
Representative and Buyer as described in this _Section 1.6_ , and will not,
and will cause the Companies not to, prevent such access by the Seller
Representative.

  


 

  

1.7 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Seller Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers) and Buyer shall allocate (i) the Purchase Price among the Securities,
in accordance with the Sellers' Allocable Portions, and (ii) the portion of
the Purchase Price (for Tax purposes) allocable to the Units (including any
Liabilities assumed or taken subject to and treated as consideration for
federal income Tax purposes) among the assets of Panadero Aggregates and, to
the extent applicable, its Subsidiaries (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "). The
Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and, with respect to the portion of
the purchase price (for Tax purposes) allocated to the Units, shall be
prepared in accordance with Section 751, Section 755 and Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and allocate such portion of the
purchase price among the various classes of assets. Within one-hundred and
twenty (120) days of the Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer the Allocation Schedule for Buyer's review and approval.
If, within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Allocation Schedule,
Buyer notifies the Seller Representative in writing that Buyer disputes any
calculation in the Allocation Schedule, Buyer and the Seller Representative
shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute. Further, the Seller
Representative shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, from time to time, revised
copies of the Allocation Schedule so as to report any matters that need
updating, and Buyer and the Seller Representative shall cooperate in good
faith to agree on such revised Allocation Schedule. Should Buyer and the
Seller Representative fail to reach an agreement within thirty (30) days after
Buyer notifies the Seller Representative of a dispute or delivery of a revised
Allocation Schedule to Buyer, Buyer and the Seller Representative shall bring
all disputes relating to the preparation of such allocation to the Independent
Accounting Firm for resolution, whose decisions shall be final and binding on
the parties (and reflected on the Allocation Schedule) and whose expenses
shall be paid equally by Buyer on one hand and the Seller Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) on the other. If the Independent Accounting Firm is
unable to resolve such dispute prior to the filing of any Tax Return to which
the Purchase Price allocation made pursuant to this _Section 1.7_ is relevant,
the applicable Tax Return shall be

  

  

  

 

6  

  

  

  

filed in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule prepared by the
Seller Representative in respect of such disputed matter, the filing of which
shall not prejudice or otherwise control the Independent Accounting Firm's
resolution of such matter. All income Tax Returns and reports filed by Buyer
and the Sellers shall be prepared consistently with the allocation as set
forth on the Allocation Schedule or, if applicable, any update thereto, except
upon a final determination by a Taxing Authority.

  


 

  

1.8 _Withholding_. Buyer and each of the Companies shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold (without duplication) from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law and
shall properly remit such amount to the appropriate Governmental Body, and the
amounts so withheld and remitted shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
withholding was made; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall first provide
five (5) Business Days' notice to the Seller Representative, prior to Buyer or
a Company deducting and withholding from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, further, that the parties to this
Agreement acknowledge that they do not currently anticipate that any
withholding will be required in connection with any consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement, if the Seller provides the relevant statement or
statements in accordance with _Section 7.10(b)_.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RELATING TO PANADERO CORP

  


 

  

Except as disclosed in a confidential disclosure letter of even date herewith
delivered by the Companies to Buyer (as amended or supplemented, the "
_Company Disclosure Letter_ "), which Company Disclosure Letter is arranged in
paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in
_Article 4_ and _Article 5_ (and the disclosure in any such numbered and

Panadero Corp is duly qualified or authorized to do business as a foreign
corporation, and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein, each party hereto agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and
to do, or cause to be done as promptly as practicable, all things necessary,
proper and advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the Transaction. Subject to appropriate
confidentiality protections,

  

  

  

 

29  

  

  

  

each party hereto shall furnish to the other parties such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing.

  


 

  

(b) Each of the parties shall cooperate with one another in good faith and use
its reasonable best efforts to prepare all necessary documentation (including
furnishing all information required under the HSR Act or other Competition
Laws) to effect promptly all necessary filings and to obtain all consents,
waivers and approvals necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party hereto shall provide to the other parties copies of
all correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any Governmental Antitrust
Entity relating to the Transaction or any of the matters described in this
_Section 7.3_. Each such party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto
of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications
with any Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any such transaction.
No party hereto shall independently participate in any formal meeting with any
Governmental Body in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to
attend and/or participate. Without limiting the obligations of Buyer pursuant
to this _Section 7.3_ , Buyer shall (i) control the strategy for obtaining any
consents, waivers and approvals from any Governmental Antitrust Entity in
connection with the Transaction and (ii) control the overall development of
the positions to be taken and the regulatory actions to be requested in any
filing or submission with a Governmental Body in connection with the
Transaction and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry or
litigation by or before, or any negotiations with, a Governmental Body
relating to the Transaction and of all other regulatory matters incidental
thereto; provided that Buyer shall consult and cooperate with the Seller
Representative with respect to such strategy, positions and requested
regulatory action (including in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under
the HSR Act or other Competition Laws) and consider the Seller
Representative's views in good faith.

  


 

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 7.3_ , the parties hereto shall provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as practicable to any Governmental Antitrust Entity information and
documents requested or required to be submitted by any Governmental Antitrust
Entity, including filing any notification and report form and related material
required under the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Law at a date
to be mutually agreed by the parties (but not to exceed thirty (30) days from
the execution of this Agreement without the written consent of the Seller
Representative), and thereafter to respond promptly to any request for
additional information or documentary material that may be made and use best
efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act
and to obtain required approval under any other applicable Competition Law, as
set forth in Section 3.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Fees associated
with filings required by the HSR Act and any other applicable Competition Law
shall be borne by Buyer.

  


 

  

(d) Further, each of the parties hereto shall take any and all actions
necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Antitrust Entity with respect to the Transaction under any
Competition Law. In connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Transaction as in
violation of any Competition Law, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate
and use its best efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Transaction, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal and all available legislative action, unless, by mutual
agreement, Buyer and the Seller Representative decide that litigation is not
in their respective best interests. Buyer and the Companies shall take any and
all actions necessary as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice
periods under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws with respect to the
Transactions reasonably promptly, and

  

  

  

 

30  

  

  

  

in any case, prior to the Outside Date. In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing, each of Buyer and the Companies agree to promptly take
any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Competition Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Antitrust
Entity, so as to enable the parties to close the Transaction reasonably
promptly and, in any case, prior to the Outside Date. The parties hereto shall
cooperate and work together in good faith in an effort to cause the expiration
of the notice periods under the HSR Act or any other Competition Laws prior to
December 31, 2017, or as promptly as practicable thereafter. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall:

  


 

  

(i) at Buyer's sole cost, comply with all restrictions and conditions, if any,
imposed or requested by any (A) Governmental Antitrust Entity with respect to
Competition Laws in connection with granting any necessary clearance or
terminating any applicable waiting period including (1) agreeing to sell,
divest, hold separate, license, cause a third party to acquire, or otherwise
dispose of, any Subsidiary, operations, divisions, businesses, product lines,
customers or assets of Buyer, its Affiliates, Panadero Corp or any of its
Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or after the Closing and regardless as to
whether a third party Buyer has been identified or approved prior to the
Closing (a " _Divestiture_ "), (2) taking or committing to take such other
actions that may limit Buyer, its Affiliates, Panadero Corp or any of its
Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one
or more of its operations, divisions, businesses, products lines, customers or
assets, and (3) entering into any Order, consent decree or other agreement to
effectuate any of the foregoing or (B) third party in connection with a
Divestiture;

  


 

  

(ii) terminate any Contract or other business relationship as may be required
to obtain any necessary clearance of any Governmental Antitrust Entity or to
obtain termination of any applicable waiting period under any Competition
Laws; and

  


 

  

(iii) not extend any waiting period or enter into any agreement or
understanding with any Governmental Antitrust Entity without the prior written
consent of the Companies (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  


 

  

(e) The parties hereto shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating
with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or
by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association
or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation
could reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Antitrust
Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the
risk of any Governmental Antitrust Entity entering an Order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) increase the risk
of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv)
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(f) The parties hereto shall take promptly, in the event that any permanent or
preliminary injunction or other Order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any Legal Proceeding that would make the
consummation of the Transaction in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the Transaction, any
and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the
taking of the steps contemplated by subsection (d)) necessary to vacate,
modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation.

  

  

  

 

31  

  


 

  

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement
(including _Sections 7.3(d)_ and _(f)_ ), (1) none of the Sellers, the Seller
Representative, Panadero Corp or any of its Subsidiaries shall, without
Buyer's prior written consent, take or commit to take any of the actions
listed in clauses (i)-(iii) of _Section 7.3(d)_ or any actions contemplated by
_Section 7.3(f)_ and (2) the Sellers, the Seller Representative, Panadero Corp
and any of its Subsidiaries shall, at Buyer's written request, take or commit
to take any of the actions listed in clauses (i)-(iii) of _Section 7.3(d)_ or
any actions contemplated by _Section 7.3(f)_ , in each case so long as such
actions are conditioned on the closing of the Transaction.

  


 

  

7.4 _Further Assurances_. Other than as provided in _Section 7.3_ , each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all
actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the Transaction, (ii) cause the
fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their
respective obligations to consummate the Transaction and (iii) execute and
deliver, upon the written request of any party hereto, any and all such
further documents, certificates, papers, schedules and instruments as
reasonably appropriate for the purpose of obtaining the benefits of this
Agreement.

  


 

  

7.5 _Confidentiality_. (a) Buyer acknowledges that the information provided to
it in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction is subject to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated
herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate, and (in accordance with _Section
2.3(b)_ ) effective upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall be automatically extended
until the date that is two (2) years following the date of such termination.

  


 

  

(b) From and after the Closing, each Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives to, keep confidential and not disclose to any other Person or
use for its own benefit or the benefit of any Person other than the Companies,
Buyer or their Affiliates, any information regarding or belonging to the
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that the Sellers and
their Affiliates are permitted to report and disclose general information
about the investment in the Companies and the Transaction to its direct and
indirect limited partners and prospective limited partners, in each case who
are bound to keep such information confidential. The obligations of each
Seller under this _Section 7.5(b)_ shall not apply to information which (i) is
or becomes generally available to the public without breach of obligations
under this _Section 7.5(b)_ , (ii) is or becomes available to such Seller or
its Affiliates from a source other than Buyer or the Companies or (iii) is
required to be disclosed by applicable Law; _provided_ , however, that in the
case of clause (iii), if reasonably possible, the applicable Seller must
notify Buyer in writing as early as practicable prior to disclosure to allow
Buyer to take appropriate measures to preserve the confidentiality of such
information (and, if requested by Buyer, such Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives to, reasonably cooperate, at Buyer's expense, with any such
effort by Buyer to preserve the confidentiality of such information).

  


 

  

7.6 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause Panadero
Corp and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the individuals who on or prior
to the Closing Date were directors, officers, managers, agents, stockholders
or employees of Panadero Corp or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such or taken at the request of Panadero Corp or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer agrees that
all rights of the Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as
provided in the respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws or
comparable organizational documents of Panadero Corp and its Subsidiaries as
now in effect, and any

  

  

  

 

32  

  

  

  

indemnification agreements or arrangements of Panadero Corp and its
Subsidiaries as now in effect shall survive the Closing Date and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. Such rights
shall not be amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights of the Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by
Law. Without limitation of the foregoing, in the event any such Indemnitee is
or becomes involved, in any capacity, in any action, proceeding or
investigation in connection with any matter for which such Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification hereunder, including the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, occurring prior to, on or after the Closing, the Companies,
from and after the Closing, shall pay, as incurred, such Indemnitee's
reasonable legal and other expenses (including the cost of any investigation
and preparation) incurred in connection therewith. The Companies shall pay,
within thirty (30) days after any request for advancement, all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys' fees, which may be incurred by any Indemnitee
in enforcing this _Section 7.6_ or any action involving an Indemnitee
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Buyer hereby acknowledges that certain Indemnitees may have rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by persons
other than Panadero Corp and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnitors_ "). Buyer hereby agrees (i) that Buyer and the Companies are the
indemnitors of first resort (i.e., their obligations to the Indemnitees are
primary and any obligation of the Indemnitors are secondary), (ii) Buyer and
the Companies shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses
incurred by any Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all
expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the
extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement or
Panadero Corp's or its Subsidiaries' respective certificate of incorporation,
by-laws or comparable organizational documents (or any other agreement between
Panadero Corp or any of the Subsidiaries and any such Indemnitee), without
regard to any rights the Indemnitee may have against the Indemnitors, and
(iii) Buyer and the Companies irrevocably waive, relinquish and release the
Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Indemnitors for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Buyer and
the Companies further agree that no advancement or payment by an Indemnitor on
behalf of an Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which an Indemnitee has
sought indemnification from the Companies shall affect the foregoing and the
applicable Indemnitor shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated
to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery
of the Indemnitee against the Companies. Buyer and the Indemnitees agree that
the Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this
_Section 7.6(b)_.

  


 

  

(c) Buyer agrees that after the Closing, it shall not permit Panadero Corp or
any of its Subsidiaries to amend, repeal or modify any provision in their
respective certificate of incorporation, by-laws or comparable organizational
documents in a manner that would adversely affect the rights and/or
exculpation or indemnification of present or former directors, officers and
managers, it being the intent of the parties that the directors, officers and
managers of Panadero Corp and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing shall
continue thereafter to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws, and Buyer agrees to cause
Panadero Corp and its Subsidiaries to perform in a timely manner and to
otherwise honor such obligations in all respects.

  


 

  

(d) On or immediately prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and the Companies shall
cause to be purchased a six (6) year tail insurance policy (the cost of which
shall be borne by Buyer) with respect to officers' and directors' liability
insurance covering the Persons who are presently covered by Panadero Corp's
and its Subsidiaries' officers' and directors' liability insurance policy,
with respect to actions and omissions occurring prior to the Closing, on terms
which are at least as favorable as the terms of such insurance in effect for
Panadero Corp and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof and from an insurer or
insurers having claims paying ratings no lower than Panadero Corp's and its
Subsidiaries' current insurer.

  

  

  

 

33  

  


 

  

(e) The obligations of Buyer under this _Section 7.6_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom
this _Section 7.6_ applies without the consent of the affected Indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.6_ applies
shall be express third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.6_ ).

  


 

  

(f) Each Indemnitee shall have the right (but not the obligation) to control
the defense of, including the investigation of, any litigation, claim or
proceeding (each, a " _Claim_ ") relating to any acts or omissions covered
under this _Section 7.6_ with counsel selected by the Indemnitee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Companies shall be permitted to participate in the
defense of such Claim at their own expense and (ii) the Companies shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  


 

  

(g) In the event any Claim is asserted or made, any determination required to
be made with respect to whether an Indemnitee's conduct complies with the
standards set forth under applicable Law, the applicable organizational
documents of Panadero Corp or any of the Subsidiaries or any indemnification
agreements or arrangements of Panadero Corp or any of the Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by such
Indemnitee.

  


 

  

(h) Each of Buyer and the Indemnitee shall, and Buyer shall cause the
Companies to, cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate,
in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and
individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

  


 

  

(i) In the event that Buyer, any Company or any of their successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger;
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer and such Company shall assume
all of the obligations of Buyer and the Companies set forth in this _Section
7.6_.

  


 

  

7.7 _Preservation of Records_. Buyer shall, and shall cause Panadero Corp and
its Subsidiaries to, preserve and keep the records (other than records
relating to Taxes, which are governed by _Section 7.10(c)_ ) held by them
relating to the respective business prior to the Closing for a period of four
(4) years from the Closing Date (or longer if required by applicable Law) and
shall make such records and personnel available to the Sellers as may be
reasonably required by the Sellers in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings or governmental investigations of, the
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or in order to enable the
Sellers to comply with their obligations under this Agreement and each of the
Company Documents and the Seller Documents, as applicable. In the event Buyer
wishes to destroy such records after that time, Buyer shall first give thirty
(30) days prior written notice to the Seller Representative and the Seller
Representative shall have the right at its option and expense, upon prior
written notice given to Buyer within such thirty (30) day period, to take
possession of the records.

  


 

  

7.8 _Publicity_. None of Buyer, any Seller, the Seller Representative or the
Companies shall, directly or indirectly, issue any press release, public
announcement or filing of any kind concerning the Transaction without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto, except where such press
release, public announcement or filing is required by applicable Law or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange and only to the extent required by such
Law or such rules; _provided_ , that the Sellers and their Affiliates are
permitted to report and disclose the status of this Agreement and the
Transaction to its direct and indirect limited partners and prospective
limited partners in connection with fund raising, marketing,

  

  

  

 

34  

  

  

  

information or reporting activities of the kind customarily provided with
respect to investments of this kind; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the Transaction in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties
hereto or any other press release, public announcement or filing of any kind
which does not contain any information relating to the parties or this
Agreement that has not been previously announced or made public in accordance
with this Agreement. In the event any such press release, public announcement
or filing is required by applicable Law, Buyer and the Companies will use
reasonable commercial efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to
comment on such press release, public announcement or filing in advance of its
issuance.

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing, Buyer shall, or
shall cause Panadero Aggregates and its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide those

Employees' service with Panadero Aggregates or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor entity) to the same extent recognized by Panadero Aggregates and
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service shall be

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are solely for the benefit of the

the Companies or Sellers shall furnish to Buyer a statement or statements
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer in form and substance, permitting the Final
Purchase Price to be paid without withholding under Section 1445 of the Code;

applicable) fail to furnish such statement or statements, Buyer's exclusive
remedy shall be to withhold to the extent required under Section 1445 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

  


 

  

(c) _Cooperation_. Following the Closing, Buyer, Sellers and the Companies
shall cooperate with and make available to the other parties, during normal

any Tax election, adopt or change any accounting method, file any Tax Return
(including any amended Tax Return) or surrender any right to claim a refund of
Taxes in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period if such election, adoption,
change, amendment or surrender would have the effect of increasing the Tax
liability of any Seller or reducing any Tax refund or credit that any Seller
is entitled to receive.

  


 

  

(e) _Tax Claims_. Buyer shall represent the interests of Panadero Aggregates
and any of its Subsidiaries in any audit, examination, investigation, claim,
contest, dispute, litigation or other

indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage, or take any other
action to knowingly facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal,
(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or

to lead to a Takeover Proposal or (iii) approve, endorse, recommend, execute
or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or merger,
acquisition or similar agreement constituting or contemplating any Takeover
Proposal. The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or
offer from any Person (other than Buyer) relating to any direct or indirect
acquisition, in one transaction or a series of transactions, including any
merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, public offering, stock
acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination,
liquidation, dissolution, or similar transaction, of (1) assets or businesses

in connection with a Takeover Proposal (other than Buyer) shall be returned to
the Companies or destroyed.

  


 

  

7.12 _Termination of Affiliate Contracts_. The Companies and, to the extent
applicable, the Sellers, shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to,

of the Company Disclosure Letter) on or prior to the Closing Date.

  


 

  

7.13 _Real Estate Matters_. The Companies shall, and shall cause their
applicable Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer (at the expense of
Buyer) in the event Buyer elects to obtain (i) new owner's title insurance
policies (or bring-downs of or endorsements to any of the existing title
insurance policies, if available) from a nationally recognized title company
selected by Buyer, dated as of a date reasonably proximate to the Closing
Date, insuring the Subsidiaries' fee simple title to each of the Owned Real
Properties, free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Exceptions, and
(ii) ALTA surveys of the Owned Real Properties (or updates to existing ALTA
surveys, if available) from one or more licensed surveyors selected by Buyer,

possible) from each of the title policies referenced in clause (i) above as to
all of the Owned Real Properties and Leased Real Properties that are material
to the business operations of Panadero Aggregates and its Subsidiaries, dated
as of a date reasonably proximate to the Closing Date and certified to Buyer,
the applicable Subsidiary and the title company. Seller agrees that any such
cooperation will include the removal or discharge of any Liens that are not
Permitted Exceptions, delivery by the Companies and/or their Subsidiaries of
any reasonable affidavits required by the title company, and the granting of
access to the Owned Real Properties by the above-referenced surveyor(s). Buyer
shall be responsible for the cost and expense of the title policies, the

37  

  

  

  

 _Section 7.13_. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Sellers nor the
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries shall be responsible for obtaining any
of the items described in this _Section 7.13._

  


 

  

7.14 _Financing_. (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Companies shall provide,
and cause their Subsidiaries to provide, and shall request that their
respective officers, employees, agents, accountants and advisors provide, to
Buyer such cooperation and assistance as is reasonably requested by Buyer in
connection with one or more debt financing transactions (" _Debt Financings_
"), including using their reasonable best efforts to (i) furnish Buyer and one
or more potential sources of a Debt Financing (" _Debt Financing Sources_ ")
with such financial and other information relating to the Companies and their
Subsidiaries as Buyer shall reasonably request in order to consummate a Debt
Financing, including (x) delivery (within 45 days of the end of the applicable
fiscal quarter) of unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related unaudited
consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of Panadero Corp and its
Subsidiaries and Panadero Aggregates and its Subsidiaries as of and for each
fiscal quarter subsequent to the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 (other
than the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017) ended prior to the Closing
Date and (y) in the event the Closing Date occurs after the date that is 60
days following December 31, 2017, delivery (within 60 days of December 31,
2017) of audited consolidated balance sheets and related audited consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows of Panadero Corp and its Subsidiaries
and Panadero Aggregates and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2017, (ii) assist in the preparation of pro forma financial
statements, (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent
accountants to provide reasonable assistance to Buyer consistent with their
customary practice (including to provide and consent to the use of their audit
reports relating to the Companies (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
audit reports of the consolidated financial statements of the Companies and
their Subsidiaries), and any necessary "comfort letters", in each case, on
customary terms and consistent with their customary practice in connection
with the Debt Financing) and (iv) cooperate reasonably with the Debt Financing
Sources' due diligence, to the extent customary and reasonable.

  


 

  

(b) In no event shall the Companies or their Subsidiaries be required to bear
any cost or expense, pay any fee, enter into any definitive agreement or incur
any other liability in connection with any Debt Financing prior to the Closing
Date. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by the Companies, reimburse the
Companies for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Companies or their Subsidiaries
and their respective Indemnitees in connection with any Debt Financing,
including the cooperation of the Companies and their Subsidiaries contemplated
by this _Section 7.14_ , and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Companies,
their Subsidiaries and their respective Indemnitees from and against any and
all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of
them in connection with the arrangement of any Debt Financing and any
information used in connection therewith, except in the case of losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses arising or resulting from fraud or willful
or intentional misrepresentation.

  


 

  

7.15 _Section 280G Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the Companies shall (a)
solicit any appropriate waivers or consents from "disqualified individuals" as
defined under Section 280G(c) of the Code (" _Disqualified Individuals_ "))
and (b) to the extent any such waivers or consents are obtained, submit for
approval by the Sellers, the Companies or their Subsidiaries, as applicable,
in a manner intended to satisfy Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, the right of each applicable
Disqualified Individual to receive or retain, as applicable, that portion of
any payments and benefits (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) that, together with any other payments and benefits the Disqualified
Individual may become entitled to receive that may be considered "parachute
payments" under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (" _Section 280G Payments_ "),
exceeds one (1) dollar less than 300% of such Disqualified Individual's "base
amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) such that the deduction
of such Section 280G Payments shall not be limited by the application of
Section 280G(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder.
The

  

  

  

 

38  

  

  

  

Companies shall forward to Buyer at least three (3) Business Days prior to
submission to the Sellers, the Companies or their Subsidiaries, as applicable,
copies of all documents prepared by the Companies in connection with this

39  

  


 

  

8.2 _Conditions Precedent to Obligations of the Sellers_. The obligations of
the Sellers to consummate the Closing are subject to the fulfillment, on or
prior to the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions (any or all of
which may be waived by the Seller Representative in whole or in part to the

ARTICLE 9

  


 

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  


 

  

9.1 _Survival_. The agreements in _Article 1_ and this _Article 9_ and
_Sections 7.5_ , _7.6_ , _7.7_ , _7.8_ , _7.9_ , _7.10_ and _7.12_ of this
Agreement shall survive the Closing. Subject to _Section 2.3(a)_ , the
remainder of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement or in any schedule, exhibit, instrument or other document pursuant
to this Agreement shall terminate at the earlier of the Closing or the time of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , and thereafter none
of the parties hereto or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective
managers, officers, directors, employees, advisors, consultants, agents or
representatives shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, except as provided in
_Section 2.3(a)_, and no claim for breach of any such representation or
warranty, detrimental reliance or other right or remedy (whether in contract,
in tort or at law or in equity) may be brought after the Closing with respect
thereto against the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
successors and permitted assigns (the " _Seller Group_ "), and there will be
no liability in respect thereof, whether such liability has accrued prior to,
on or after the Closing, on the part of the Sellers, the Companies or any
other member of the Seller Group, except that nothing herein shall operate to
limit the common law liability of any Seller to Buyer for fraud in the event

  

  

  

 

40  

  

  

  

such Seller is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
willfully and knowingly committed fraud against Buyer, with the specific
intent to deceive and mislead Buyer, regarding the express representations and
warranties made in this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 9.1_ will
not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action (i) under _Section 9.2_ to
obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and (ii) under
_Section 1.6_ to enforce any decision or determination of the Valuation Firm.

  


 

  

9.2 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document are not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or are otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any
action required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other applicable remedies at law
or equity, the parties and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without proof of damages,
to prevent breaches of this Agreement or any Transaction Document and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and any
Transaction Document. If any party brings any action to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the
party bringing such action may unilaterally extend the Outside Date
(notwithstanding the termination provisions of _Section 2.1_ ), so long as the
party bringing such action is seeking a court order for an injunction or
injunctions or to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that
(i) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.
In no event shall the exercise of the Companies' right to seek specific
performance pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit
the Seller Representative's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ or pursue all applicable remedies at law, including seeking
money damages. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives (i) any defenses in
any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at
law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any law to post a bond or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  


 

  

9.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
Companies, the Sellers and Buyer shall bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each
Transaction Document and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

  


 

  

9.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents and
all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement and/or the other Transaction
Documents or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
and/or the other Transaction Documents (including any claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made
in or in connection with this Agreement and/or the other Transaction
Documents), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws
principles thereof that might require the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction.

  


 

  

9.5 _Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_. All claims, actions and
proceedings (whether in contract or tort) based upon, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and/or the other
Transaction Documents (including any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents) shall
be heard and determined in any state or federal court sitting in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state
or federal court within the State of Delaware), and the parties hereto

  

  

  

 

41  

  

  

  

hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and,
in the case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding, and any judgment of
such courts may be enforced in any other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or by any other manner provided by law. The consents to jurisdiction set forth
in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of process
in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as
provided in this _Section 9.5_ and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any
Person other than the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law.

  


 

  

9.6 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT TO ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION WHETHER ARISING
IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.6_.

  


 

  

9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Buyer Disclosure Letter and exhibits and Schedules hereto), the
Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire
understanding and agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
agreements, arrangements, contracts, discussions, negotiations, undertakings
and understandings (whether written or oral and including any letter of intent
or other similar preliminary documents) between the parties with respect to
such subject matter (other than the Confidentiality Agreement). The parties
hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and
obligations with respect to the Transaction exclusively in contract pursuant
to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and any other executed agreement entered into by the parties hereto
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and the parties
hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any
remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents
and any other executed agreement entered into by the parties hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the parties
each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable
expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arm's-length negotiations,
and all parties specifically acknowledge that no party has any special
relationship with another party that would justify any expectation beyond that
of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm's-length transaction.
The sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth herein,
made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement)
or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related to the
Transaction shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach
of contract (including as set forth in _Section 9.2_ ) against the parties to
this Agreement only (as such contractual remedies have been further limited or
excluded pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement), and the parties
hereby agree that neither party hereto shall have any remedies or causes of
action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for any statements,
communications, disclosures, failures to disclose, or representations or
warranties not explicitly set forth in this Agreement. The parties agree that
the representations and warranties contained herein are for contractual risk
allocation purposes only.

  

  

  

 

42  

  


 

  

9.8 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement, including the Company Disclosure
Letter and the Buyer Disclosure Letter, can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

  


 

  

9.9 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered personally by hand
(with written confirmation of receipt), (ii) when sent by telecopy facsimile
transmission (with written confirmation of transmission), or (iii) one
Business Day following the day sent by overnight courier (with written
confirmation of receipt), in each case at the following addresses and

have specified by notice given to the other party pursuant to this provision):

Agreement or its negotiation or execution; and each party hereto waives and

9.14 _Provision With Respect to Legal Representation_. Buyer and the Companies
hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of their directors, members,
officers, employees and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns
(all such parties, the " _Waiving Parties_ "), that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP
(" _Weil_ ") and Driver McAfee Peek and Hawthorne, P.C. (" _Driver_ ") (or any
of their respective successors) may represent the Sellers or any director,
member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of any Seller, in each case in
connection with any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any ancillary documents hereto
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby notwithstanding its
representation (or any continued representation) of Panadero Corp and/or any
of its Subsidiaries, and each of Buyer and the Companies on behalf of itself
and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and
will not assert) any actual or potential conflict of interest or any objection
arising therefrom or relating thereto. Buyer and the Companies acknowledge
that the foregoing provision applies whether or not Weil provides legal
services to Panadero Corp or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date.
Each of Buyer and the Companies, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between the
Companies and the Sellers and their counsel, including Weil and Driver, made
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance under, or any dispute or

  

  

  

 

45  

  

  

  

proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any ancillary
documents hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are
privileged communications (the " _Privileged Communications_ ") and that
ownership of privilege with respect thereto does not pass to the Companies
notwithstanding the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and instead remain with and are controlled by the Seller
Representative; _provided_ , that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
be a waiver by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Companies and their Affiliates) of any applicable privileges or
protections that can or may be asserted to prevent disclosure of any such
communications to any third party. Buyer and the Companies, together with any
of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree
that no Person may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications,
whether located in the records or email server of the Companies or otherwise,
in any action against or involving any of the parties after the Closing to the
extent such Privileged Communications would be subject to a privilege or
protection if they were being requested in a proceeding by an unrelated third
party; and Buyer and the Companies agree not to assert that the privilege has
been waived as to the Privileged Communication that may be located in the
records or email server of the Companies. The parties hereto hereby agree that
nothing herein is intended or should be construed as a waiver of any
privileges or protections that can or may be asserted to prevent disclosure of
any Privileged Communications to any third party.

  


 

  

9.15 _Exhibits and Disclosure Letters_. For purposes of the representations
and warranties of the Companies contained herein, disclosure in any section of
the Company Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter of any facts or
circumstances shall be deemed to be adequate response and disclosure of such
facts or circumstances with respect to all representations or warranties by
such entities calling for disclosure of such information, if it is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure item that another disclosure section
is also applicable. The disclosure of any matter or item in any section of the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed
to constitute an acknowledgment that any such matter is required to be
disclosed. The inclusion of any matter, information or item in any section of
the Company Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter shall not be
deemed to constitute an admission of any Liability by the Companies to any
third party or otherwise imply that any such matter, information or item is
material or creates a measure for materiality for the purposes of this
Agreement.

  


 

  

9.16 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing Date, except for any rights or
obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, each of

judgments, duties, debts, dues, accounts, bonds, contracts and covenants

or in equity which the Releasing Parties may have against each of the Released
Parties, now or in the future, in each case in respect of any cause, matter or
thing relating to the Companies and their Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and

by, the Seller Representative under or pursuant to this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents or in connection with the Transactions has been
unconditionally authorized by the Sellers to be taken, omitted to be taken, or
executed on their behalf so that they will be legally bound thereby, and no
Seller shall institute any Legal Proceeding against Buyer, the Companies or
any of their respective Affiliates alleging that the Seller Representative did
not have the authority to act on behalf of the Sellers in connection with any
such action, omission or

  

  

  

 

47  

  

  

  

execution. No modification or revocation of the power of attorney granted by
the Sellers herein to the Seller Representative shall be effective as against

respective Affiliates are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for
any acts done by the Seller Representative and any acts done by Buyer or the
Companies in accordance with any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
