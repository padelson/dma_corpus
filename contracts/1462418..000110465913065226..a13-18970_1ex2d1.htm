2.5. _Purchase Price Adjustment._

 



 

(a) After the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased, on
a dollar-for-dollar basis, in accordance with this Section 2.5. Any such

accounting entries will be made regardless of their amount and all detected
errors and omissions will be corrected regardless of their materiality.

 



 

(b) No later than the later of: (x) ninety (90) days after the Closing Date or

provided to Purchaser within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
_provided,_ that Purchaser shall afford Sellers and their Representatives all
reasonably requested access for the purposes of compiling the audited closing
balance sheet and shall cause the officers of the Company to comply with any
reasonable request of Sellers in connection therewith), Purchaser shall
deliver to the Seller Representative the following:

 



 

(i) a statement setting forth the Net Working Capital of the Company as of the
Effective Time (the **" _Closing Net Working Capital Statement_ "**);

 



 

(ii) a statement setting forth the Cash of the Company as of the Effective
Time, and the amount of the Fannie Mae Cash (the **" _Cash Statement_ "**);
and

 



 

(iii) a separate statement showing any calculations with respect to any

Schedule to the Seller Representative, Purchaser shall provide the Seller
Representative with reasonable access to all books and records and personnel
of the Company to enable the Seller Representative to evaluate the accuracy of
the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the Cash Statement. The Seller

 



      
 

 



 

Representative shall, within such thirty (30)-day period, accept or reject the
Price Adjustment submitted by Purchaser. If the Seller Representative
disagrees with such calculation, it shall give written notice to Purchaser of
such disagreement and any reason therefor (a **" _Notice of Disagreement with
Price Adjustment_ "**) within such thirty (30)-day period. Should the Seller
Representative fail to provide Purchaser with a Notice of Disagreement with
Price Adjustment within such thirty (30)-day period, Sellers shall be deemed
to agree with Purchasers calculations. During the thirty (30) days
immediately following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement with Price
Adjustment, Purchaser and Seller Representative shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to the
matters specified in such Notice of Disagreement with Price Adjustment. If
such differences have not been resolved by the end of such thirty (30)-day
period, Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall submit to the Chicago,
Illinois office of Ernst and Young LLP (the **" _Arbitrator_ "**) for review and
resolution of any and all matters which remain in dispute and which were
included in any Notice of Disagreement with Price Adjustment. In the event
that the Arbitrator has rendered material and substantial services to any
Party at any time during the two (2) year period prior to such dispute, the
Purchaser shall nominate three (3) independent accounting firms of nationally
recognized standing that have not so rendered services to any Party during
such period and the Seller Representative shall choose one (1) of such firms
to serve as the Arbitrator; _provided_ , that if Purchaser fails to nominate
three (3) such firms within ten (10) days of the end of such thirty (30)-day
period or the Seller Representative fails to choose one (1) such firm within
ten (10) days of its receipt of such nomination, an accounting firm chosen by
the Seller Representative or Purchaser, respectively, shall serve as the
Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator and shall issue its
report as to the contents of the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the
Cash Statement, and the determination of the Price Adjustment reflected in the
Final Adjustment Schedule, within sixty (60) days after such dispute is
referred to the Arbitrator. Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall be
permitted to present a supporting brief to the Arbitrator (which supporting
brief shall also be concurrently provided to the other party) within twenty
(20) days of the appointment of the Arbitrator. Within twenty (20) days of
receipt of a supporting brief, the receiving party may present a responsive
brief to the Arbitrator (which responsive brief shall also be concurrently
provided to the other party). Each of Purchaser and the Seller Representative
may make an oral presentation to the Arbitrator (in which case, such
presenting party shall notify the other party of such presentation, and the
other party shall have the right to be present (but not speak) at such
presentation, within fifty (50) days of the appointment of the Arbitrator. The
Arbitrator shall only consider the briefs and oral presentations of Purchaser
and the Seller Representative, and shall not conduct any independent review,
in determining those items and amounts disputed by the parties. The Arbitrator
shall select either the position of Purchaser or the Seller Representative as
a resolution for each item or amount disputed and may not impose an
alternative resolution with respect to any item or amount disputed and must
resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall
bear all costs and expenses incurred by it or them in connection with such
arbitration, except that the Arbitrator may, in its discretion, direct that
its fees hereunder shall be borne by the non-prevailing party. This provision
for arbitration shall be specifically enforceable by the Parties and, absent
manifest mathematical error, the decision of the Arbitrator in accordance with
the provisions hereof shall be final and binding with respect to the matters
so arbitrated and there shall be no right of appeal therefrom.

 



 

(d) If, based on the Final Adjustment Schedule as finally determined:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) (A) the Net Working Capital of the Company as of the Effective Time is
less than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, Sellers, jointly and
severally, shall pay to Purchaser such deficiency, or (B) the Net Working
Capital of the Company as of the Effective Time is greater than the Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay to each Seller the
percentage of such excess set forth next to such Sellers name on _Schedule
2.4(d)(iii)_ (or to Vella as directed by Sellers), in each case in cash or
other immediately available funds no later than two (2) Business Days
following the date of such final determination; and

 



 

(ii) (A) the Cash of the Company as of the Effective Time is less than the
Fannie Mae Cash, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall pay to Purchaser such
deficiency, or (B) the Cash of the Company as of the Effective Time is greater
than the Fannie Mae Cash, Purchaser shall pay to each Seller the percentage of
such excess set forth next to such Sellers name on _Schedule 2.4(d)(iii)_
(or to Vella as directed by Sellers), in each case in cash or other
immediately available funds no later than two (2) Business Days following the
date of such final determination.

 



 

(e) In the event that the Expected Employee Bonuses as set forth on the
Closing Net Working Capital Statement and Final Adjustment Schedule, as
finally determined, is greater than the employee bonuses pro-rated for pre-
Closing periods actually paid by the Company or Altisource Solutions, Inc. (as
determined no later the December 31, 2014), then Purchaser shall pay to each
Seller the percentage of such excess set forth next to such Sellers name on
_Schedule 2.4(d)(iii)_ (or to Vella as directed by Sellers), in each case in
cash or other immediately available funds no later than ten (10) Business Days
following the date of such final determination of all such employee bonuses.

 



 

2.6. _Post-Closing Contingent Earn-Out Payments._

 



 

(a) As additional consideration for the sale of the Shares, Sellers may be
entitled to receive additional contingent payments (collectively, the **"
_Earn-Out Payments_ "**) in the manner described in this Section 2.6. The
Earn-Out Payments shall be calculated as follows:

 



 

(i) As further described in this Section 2.6, promptly following the end of
each Measurement Period, Purchaser shall calculate the Adjusted EBITA during
such Measurement Period and/or the Normalized Adjusted EBITA during such
Measurement Period or other Measurement Period (if applicable, as further
required by _Exhibit A_).

 



 

(ii) With respect to those Measurement Periods set forth on _Exhibit A_, in
the event that the Adjusted EBITA equals an amount set forth in the middle
column of the applicable chart attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, then Sellers
shall be entitled to an aggregate Earn-Out Payment equal to the amount set
forth in the corresponding row in the right-hand column of the chart attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser
may, in their sole reasonable discretion, make an appropriate adjustment to
the Adjusted

 



      
 

 



 

EBITA targets in the left column of each of the tables contained in _Exhibit
A_ to reflect a cost of capital adjustment for additional debt and/or equity
incurred by the Company to finance any acquisition or other transaction
(including, without limitation, a capital expenditure), or make such other
adjustment as Parent and Purchaser, in their sole reasonable discretion, deems
necessary to adjust such Adjusted EBITA targets to reflect the effect of any
such acquisition or other transaction on the Company and its business. During
each Measurement Period, to the extent either Seller or Vella: (A) is employed
or engaged by the Company to perform services, such Seller and Vella shall
ensure his services are performed in good faith and in the best interests of
the Company, or (B) has Knowledge that a Person over whom either Seller or
Vella has authority has materially failed to perform his or her services to
the Company in accordance with the written policies and procedures of
Purchaser, such Seller or Vella, as applicable, shall use reasonable efforts
to notify the human resources department of Parent or Purchaser with respect
to such violation. The Parties acknowledge and agree that under no
circumstance shall the aggregate amount of the Earn-Out Payments paid or
payable hereunder exceed Eighty Million Dollars ($80,000,000.00).

3.5. _Taxes._

 



 

(a) The Company is classified as a partnership for Federal and applicable
state tax purposes and has never been taxable for such purposes as a
corporation or association, or made an election to be so taxed. The Company
does not own any equity interests in any other Person that is subject to tax
as a corporation or association taxable as a corporation.

 



 

(b) All Tax Returns that were required to be filed (taking into account any
extensions of time within which to file) by the Company have been duly and
timely filed, and all such Tax Returns were true, correct, and complete in all
material respects. All Taxes shown to be due on the foregoing Tax Returns or
other Taxes that were otherwise due and payable by the Company have been
timely paid in full. All Taxes that the Company was obligated to withhold from
amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, partner or third party have
been paid over to the proper Governmental Body in a timely manner, to the
extent due and payable, and any Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes are
true, correct, and complete in all material respects. No currently effective
extensions or waivers of statutes of limitation have been given by or

with respect to the assessment of any Taxes due from the Company. No
deficiencies or adjustments for any Taxes have been proposed or assessed in
writing with respect to the Company, and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, there
is no factual or legal basis for the assessment of any deficiency or
adjustment in Taxes with respect to the Company. There is no audit,
examination or other proceeding in progress with respect to any Tax Return of
the Company, and no Governmental Body has notified Sellers or the Company in
writing that it intends to commence any audit, examination or other proceeding
with respect to any Tax Return of the Company. There are no matters under
discussion with any Governmental Body with respect to Taxes that would
reasonably be expected to result in an additional amount of Taxes, and, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, there is no threatened action, suit, proceeding,
investigation, audit, or claim for or relating to Taxes regarding the Company.
No Security Interests for Taxes exist with respect to any assets or properties
of the Company. The Company has disclosed on its Tax Returns all positions
taken therein that would reasonably be expected to give rise to the accuracy-
related penalties of Section 6662 or Section 6662A of the IRC or to a similar
penalty under the Legal Requirements of any other taxing jurisdiction, and has
otherwise properly disclosed to the appropriate Governmental Body all
positions or transactions relating to Taxes that are required to be disclosed
under the Legal Requirements of any jurisdiction to which the Company is
subject. Sellers have heretofore delivered to Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

true, correct and complete copies of all of the federal and state Tax Returns
of the Company for the respective tax years ended December 31, 2012, December
31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, and no amendments or other changes have been
made thereto since the date of such delivery.

 



 

(c) The Company has made adequate provision in its financial statements (in
accordance with GAAP, utilizing the accrual method of accounting
notwithstanding any determination that such method is not required in order to
comply with GAAP) for all unpaid Taxes of the Company, and the charges,
accruals, and reserves with respect to unpaid Taxes on the books of the
Company are adequate (as determined in accordance with GAAP) and are at least
equal to the liabilities of the Company for unpaid Taxes. Since December 31,
2012, the Company has not incurred any liability for Taxes other than in the
Ordinary Course.

 



 

(d) The Company has never been a member of any affiliated, combined, unitary
or similar group filing a consolidated, combined, unitary or similar federal
or state income Tax Return (other than the group that includes Sellers and the
Company) and none of the assets of the Company would reasonably be expected to
be subject to levy for the Tax liabilities of Sellers, the Company, or any
other person or entity under Treasury Regulations §1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Legal Requirements), including as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. The Company is not a party
to or bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing, or Tax allocation agreements.

 



 

(e) No written claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction
where the Company does not file Tax Returns that the Company is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction, nor, to the Knowledge of Sellers, is
there any factual or legal basis for any such claim.

 



 

(f) The Company is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of Sections 1445
and 7701 of the IRC. The Company has not been a United States real property
holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the IRC during

(c) Except as to those plans identified on _Schedule 3.6(c)_ as tax-qualified
Company Plans (the **" _Company Qualified Plans_ "**), no member of the
Company Group maintains or previously maintained a Company Plan which meets or
was intended to meet the requirements of IRC Section 401(a). The IRS has
issued favorable determination or opinion letters to the effect that the
Company Qualified Plan qualifies under IRC Section 401(a) and that any related
trust is exempt from taxation under IRC Section 501(a), and such determination
or opinion letters remain in effect and have not been revoked. The Company
Qualified Plans currently comply in form with the requirements under IRC
Section 401(a), other than changes required by statutes, regulations and
rulings for which amendments are not yet required.

 



 

(d) No issue concerning the qualification of the Company Qualified Plans is
pending before, or to Sellers Knowledge is threatened, by the IRS. The
Company Qualified

 



      
 

 



 

Plans have been administered according to their terms (except for those terms
which are inconsistent with the changes required by statutes, regulations, and
rulings for which changes are not yet required to be made, in which case the
Company Qualified Plans have been administered in accordance with the
provisions of those statutes, regulations and rulings) and in accordance with
the requirements of IRC Section 401(a) in all material respects.

terminated on or prior to the Closing Date without liability to any member of
the Company Group or Purchaser, including without limitation, any additional

under the terms of each of the Company Plans and in accordance with applicable
Legal Requirements to be paid as a contribution to the Company Plan and no

contributions made or not made to a Company Plan. The assets of all Company
Plans which are required under applicable Legal Requirements to be held in
trust are in fact held in trust, and the assets of each such Company Plan
equal or exceed the liabilities of each such plan. The liabilities of each
other plan are properly and accurately reported on the financial statements
and records of the Company. The assets of the Company Plan are reported at
their fair market value on the books and records of each plan.

 



 

(k) No member of the Company Group has any past, present, or future obligation

"party in interest" (as defined in IRC Section 4975 and ERISA Section 3(14),
respectively) with respect to the Company Plans, has engaged in any

a Company Plan, have complied in all material respects with the requirements
of ERISA Section 404. No member of the Company Group and no party in interest

investigations, suits or claims pending, or to Sellers Knowledge, threatened,
against the Company Plan, any trust or other funding agency created
thereunder, or against any fiduciary of the Company Plan or against the assets
of the Company Plan. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.6(o)_ , the

acceleration or increase of any of the rights or benefits to which Employees
may be entitled thereunder.

 



 

(p) Except as listed in _Schedule 3.6(p)_ , no member of the Company Group

benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) (a " _Pension

securities of or interests in the Company.

 



 

(e) Except for the fees and expenses payable to Moelis and Company LLC, which
shall be paid by Sellers (including pursuant to Section 2.4(d)(i)(E)), neither
such Seller nor his or its agents have incurred any obligation or Liability,
contingent or otherwise, for brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions

Purchaser has the

 



      
 

 



 

right, power, and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and to perform its
obligations under such Transaction Documents.

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents by Parent

Parent or Purchaser; (ii) any resolution adopted by the board of directors or
the shareholders of Parent or Purchaser; or (iii) any Legal Requirement or

specifically agrees that prior to the Closing, the Company may distribute all
or any part of the items set forth on _Schedule 5.2_ and any Cash (other than
the Fannie Mae Cash) to Sellers.

 



 

5.3. _Required Approvals._

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Legal Requirements and
regulations to consummate and make effective the Contemplated Transactions,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
waivers, consents and approvals. Without limiting the foregoing, if an HSR
Filing is required pursuant to the HSR Act prior to the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, each of the Parties agrees: (i) to submit the HSR
Filing and any filings required by antitrust regulations of other
jurisdictions including foreign countries that the Parties deem advisable or
appropriate, with Purchaser making the ultimate determination as to whether it
is advisable and appropriate to make such filing; (ii) to use commercially
reasonable efforts to comply as expeditiously as possible with all lawful
requests of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division, or other
governmental competition authorities ( **" _Antitrust Agencies_ "**) for
additional information or documents; (iii) to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the expeditious termination of the HSR Act waiting period(s);
(iv) to not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Body not to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the other Party; (v)
subject to Legal Requirements, to inform promptly counsel for the other Party
of any material communications from any Antitrust Agency regarding the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement; and (vi) subject to Legal
Requirements, to provide promptly to counsel for the other Party such
information as the other Party may reasonably request in order to enable it to
prepare the filings, reports, documents and other materials referred to in
this section. Each Party shall, and each Seller shall cause the Company to,
promptly notify the other Parties of any communication it receives from any
Antitrust Agency relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and permit the other Parties to review and comment on in advance any
proposed communication by such Party or the Company to any Antitrust Agency
and shall provide the other Parties with copies of all correspondence, filings
or communications between such Party, the Company, or any of their Affiliates
and any Antitrust Agency. A Party shall not,

 



      
 

 



 

and Sellers shall cause the Company not to, agree to participate in any
meeting with any Antitrust Agency in respect of any such filings,
investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Antitrust Agency, gives the other
Parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Each Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any clearance under the
HSR Act or other applicable Legal Requirement of an Antitrust Agency or to
resolve any objections that may be asserted thereby, in each case as promptly
as practicable. Nothing in this Section 5.3(a) shall require Parent,
Purchaser, or any of their Affiliates to dispose of any assets of Parent,
Purchaser, their Affiliates, the Company, or any portion of the Business, or
take any action that is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, Purchaser, or any of their Affiliates, or the results of operations or
condition (financial or otherwise) of any portion of the Company or its
Business.

 



 

(b) Sellers will, and will cause the Company to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to receive all necessary Consents: (i) of each Governmental Body from
which Consent may be required to consummate the Contemplated Transactions
(except for the HSR Act, which is addressed in Section 5.3 above), (ii) of all
lenders, lessors, development authorities, joint venturers, and other Persons
(A) whose consent may be required to permit the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions or to provide Purchaser the full right, title,
benefits, and interest of Sellers and the Company in and to the Company and
the Business, or (B) who may have a Security Interest on any portion of the
assets of the Company or the Shares (and further to obtain termination and
transfer agreements from each lessor (including but not limited to the
requisite UCC-3 termination statements)), and (iii) with respect to each other
matter, and from each other Person, specifically identified on _Exhibit B_
hereof (the " ** _Required Approvals_** "). Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Sellers and the Company in obtaining all
such consents described in this Section 5.3(b).

 



 

5.4. _No Negotiation._

 



 

Until such time, if any, as this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
7, Sellers will negotiate exclusively with Purchaser with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions. Sellers further agree not to, and will cause the
Company not to, solicit or consider other proposals concerning the sale of any
part of the Business, the Shares, or the assets of the Company (other than in
the Ordinary Course), or provide information with respect to the Business, the
Shares, or the assets of the Company to other entities expressing interest in
acquiring, leasing or managing any part of the Business, the Shares, or the
assets of the Company whether for themselves or others, or to divulge or
otherwise disclose any information to such entities regarding any aspects of
the Contemplated Transactions, including but not limited to, purchase price,
terms, or status of negotiations and discussions between Sellers, Purchaser,
or their authorized representatives. Sellers shall, and Sellers shall cause
the Company to, notify Purchaser if any such proposal is made.

 



 

5.5. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts._

 



 

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, each of the Parties
will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
conditions in Section 6 to be satisfied. Sellers will, and will cause the
Company to, use their commercially reasonable efforts

 



      
 

 



 

not to take any action that is designed or intended to have the effect of
discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer, supplier, employee or other
business associate of the Company from maintaining substantially the same
business relationships with Purchaser and the Company after the Closing as it
maintained with the Company prior to the Closing.

 



 

5.6. _Access to Records; Litigation Support._

 



 

(a) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Sellers shall have
reasonable access to all of the books and records of the Company existing as
of the Closing Date (including any books and records relating to Taxes and Tax
Returns of the Company), to the extent that such access may reasonably be
required by a Seller in connection with matters relating to or affected by the
operations of the Company prior to the Closing Date, including the preparation
of Sellers financial reports or Tax Returns, any Tax audits, the defense or
prosecution of litigation (including arbitration or mediation), and any other
reasonable need of Sellers to consult such books and records. Such access
shall be afforded by Purchaser upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and
during normal business hours. The Seller seeking access shall be solely
responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this Section
5.6(a). If any such books or records, or any other documents which Sellers
have the right to have access to pursuant to this Section 5.6(a) are produced
by Purchaser, Parent or the Company to a party which is actually adverse to
Sellers (e.g., in litigation or in connection with a government
investigation), to the extent permitted by Legal Requirements as determined in
the reasonable discretion of legal counsel to Purchaser, Purchaser shall
endeavor to immediately make all such books, records and/or documents produced
available for inspection and copying by Sellers concurrently with the
production of such books, records and/or documents. In addition, if Purchaser,
Parent or the Company shall desire to dispose of any of such books or records
prior to the expiration of such seven (7)-year period, Purchaser shall, prior
to such disposition, give Sellers a reasonable opportunity, at Sellers
expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Sellers may select.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, in the event and for so long as any Party actively
is contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand in connection with: (i) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving any Party, each of the other Parties will reasonably cooperate
with the contesting or defending Party and its counsel in the contest or
defense, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access
to its books and records as shall be necessary in connection with the contest
or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending
Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under Section 8 below).

 



 

(c) Any Seller may retain copies of any contracts, documents or records: (i)
which are required to be retained pursuant to any Legal Requirement or are
subject to Sellers attorney-client privilege, or (ii) for Sellers financial
reporting purposes, for Sellers Tax purposes or for Sellers legal defense or
prosecution purposes.

 



      
 

 



 

5.7. _Tax Matters._

 



 

(a) _General_. For the sole purpose of appropriately apportioning any Taxes
relating to a Tax year or Tax period that begins before and ends after the
Effective Time (a **" _Straddle Period_ "**), such apportionment shall be made
assuming the Company had a taxable year that ended at the Effective Time. In
the case of property Taxes and other Taxes that apply ratably to a taxable
period, the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending at the Effective Time shall equal the Tax for the period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days in the period
up to and including the Effective Time and the denominator of which shall be
the total number of days in the period. All other Taxes for any Tax Return
that involves a Straddle Period shall be based upon the actual events and
transactions that occur within such Straddle Period.

 



 

(b) _Tax Indemnification_.

 



 

(i) Sellers shall be responsible for and pay and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser from and against all Taxes of or applicable to the Company
for any Tax year or Tax period ending on or before the Effective Time, and, in
the case of a Straddle Period, to the extent apportioned to the period that
ends at the Effective Time in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section;
_provided, however_ , that Sellers not be responsible for any Taxes that have
been accrued as a liability that has been included in the computation of Net
Working Capital of the Company as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers against all Taxes of or with respect to the Company for all Tax years
or Tax periods ending after the Effective Time, or, with respect to a Straddle
Period, to the extent apportioned to the period after the Effective Time in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

 



 

(c) _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(i) For periods following the Effective Time, Purchaser on the one hand, and
Sellers on the other hand (as the case may be) who receives notice of a Tax
audit or other proceeding shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of
any such audit or proceeding or any proposed assessment or the commencement of
any tax contest or any demand or claim on Purchaser, the Company, or their
Affiliates that, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of
time, would reasonably be expected to be grounds for an indemnification claim
by Purchaser against Sellers under paragraph (b) of this section (a **" _Tax
Contest_ "**). Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent
known to Purchaser, Sellers, its Affiliates or the Company) describing the
asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any
notice or other document received from any taxing authority in respect of any
such asserted Tax liability.

 



 

(ii) In the case of a Tax Contest that relates to taxable periods ending on or
before the Effective Time, Sellers shall have the sole right, at their
expense, to control the conduct of such Tax Contest; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Seller Representative shall seek Purchasers prior written consent of
any settlement or

 



      
 

 



 

compromise of such Tax Contest (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of any resolution of the Tax Contest if such resolution
adversely affects the computation of any item of income, expense, deduction,
taxable income, credit or Tax liability for any period ending after the
Effective Time.

 



 

(iii) Purchaser shall direct and control any Tax Contest not controlled by
Sellers in accordance with Section 5.7(c)(ii). Purchaser may not settle or
compromise any asserted Tax liability in a manner that would result in an
indemnification liability of Sellers pursuant to this Section 5.7, or that
adversely affects the computation of any item of income, expense, deduction,
taxable income, credit, or Tax liability for any taxable period before the
Effective Time without the prior written consent of Seller Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

(iv) Purchaser and Sellers agree to cooperate, and Purchaser agrees to cause
the Company (as applicable) to cooperate, in the defense against or compromise
of any claim in any Tax Contest.

 



 

(d) _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, on a basis consistent
with past tax accounting practices all non-income Tax related Tax Returns of
the Company for all Tax periods ending on or prior to the Effective Time, and
shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Seller Representative a
substantially final draft of each such Tax Return at least thirty (30)
calendar days prior to the due date, giving effect to extensions thereto, for
filing such Tax Return, for review and filing by Purchaser. The Seller
Representative shall notify Purchaser within ten (10) calendar days of the
receipt of such draft Tax Return of any reasonable objections the Seller
Representative may have to any items set forth in such draft Tax Return, and
the Seller Representative and Purchaser agree to consult and resolve in good
faith any such objection and to mutually consent to the filing of such Tax
Return. Purchaser shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all such Tax
Returns, and timely pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all Taxes shown due on
such returns. One Business Day prior to the date on which such Tax Returns are
filed, Sellers shall pay the amount of Taxes for which Sellers are responsible
under Section 5.7(b)(i) to Purchaser or a Person designated by Purchaser.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared
and filed, all non-income Tax related Tax Returns of the Company for all Tax
periods ending after the Effective Time, including Straddle Periods, and
timely pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all Taxes shown due on such
returns. Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Seller
Representative a substantially final draft of each such Tax Return, but only
such Tax Returns that include a Straddle Period, with respect to which Sellers
may be responsible for the payment of any Tax at least thirty (30) calendar
days prior to the due date, giving

 



       
 

 



 

effect to extensions thereto, for filing such Tax Return, for review by the
Seller Representative. The Seller Representative shall notify Purchaser within
ten (10) calendar days of receipt of such Tax Return of any reasonable
objections the Seller Representative may have to any items set forth in such
draft Tax Return, and Purchaser and the Seller Representative agree to consult
and resolve in good faith any such objection and to mutually consent to the
filing of such Tax Return. One Business Day prior to the date on which such
Tax Returns are filed, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the amount of Taxes for
which Sellers are responsible under paragraph (b)(i) of this section.

 



 

(iii) Neither Purchaser nor the Company shall file any amended Tax Return for
any period that ends on or before the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of Sellers (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
required under applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(e) _Refunds_. Any refunds, rebates, credits or overpayments of Taxes of the
Company for any taxable period ending on or before the Effective Time shall be
for the account of Sellers. Any refunds, rebates, credits or overpayments of
the Company for any taxable period beginning after the Effective Time shall be
for the account of Purchaser. Any refunds, rebates, credits or overpayments of
Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned
between Sellers on the one hand, and Purchaser on the other hand, applying the
rules and regulations of the Governmental Body applicable to such Tax Return.

 



 

(f) _Cooperation_. After the Closing, Purchaser and Sellers shall promptly
make available or cause to be made available to the other, as reasonably
requested, and to any taxing authority, all information, records or documents
relating to Tax liabilities and potential Tax liabilities relating to the
Business for all periods prior to or including the Closing Date, and shall not
destroy any such information, records and documents without the permission of
Purchaser. Sellers shall prepare and provide to Purchaser any Tax information
packages reasonably requested by Purchaser for Purchasers use in preparing
the Companys Tax Returns, or alternatively, will provide reasonable access to
the books and records containing such information. Such Tax information
packages shall be completed by Sellers and provided to Purchaser, or such
reasonable access shall be provided, within sixty (60) calendar days after the
request therefor. Each Party shall bear its own expenses in complying with the
foregoing provisions.

 



 

(g) _Tax Treatment of Transaction_. Purchaser and Sellers agree to treat the
purchase and sale of the Shares in accordance with Rev. Rul. 99-6, Situation 2
as follows: (i) as to Purchaser, as the purchase by Purchaser of "all of" the
assets of the Company from Sellers, and (ii) as to Sellers, as the sale by
Sellers of the Shares. For purposes of IRC Sections 743(b), 755 and 1060 and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, the Purchase Price
shall be allocated among the Companys assets using the methodology set forth
in IRC Section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and shall be set
forth on _Exhibit I_ hereto (the **" _Allocation Schedule_ "**), which
Allocation Schedule shall be amended by Purchaser, and timely delivered to
Sellers, to take into account any changes in the Purchase Price as set forth
in this Agreement. The Parties (A) will, and will cause each of their
respective Affiliates to, prepare and file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form
8308) in a manner consistent with the Allocation

 



      
 

 



 

Schedule, and (B) will not, and will cause each of their respective Affiliates
not to, take any position inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule, unless
required by applicable Legal Requirements (including the resolution of a Tax
audit). In the event that the purchase price allocation reflected in the
Allocation Schedule is disputed by any Tax authority, the Party receiving
notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other Parties in writing, and
the Parties agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
defend the purchase price allocation in any audit or similar Tax proceeding.

 



 

5.8. _Notice of Developments._

 



 

The Seller Representative shall deliver to Purchaser promptly after any Seller
becomes aware of any change affecting the content of the Disclosure Schedule,
but in any event no later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, a
revised Disclosure Schedule to the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3, to reflect any matters which have occurred from and after the date
of this Agreement, which, if existing on the date of this Agreement, would
have resulted in a disclosure or exception with regard to any such
representation and warranty. It is specifically agreed that the Disclosure
Schedule may be supplemented, amended and/or added to, to add immaterial, as
well as material, items thereto. No such supplement, amendment or addition
shall be deemed to cure any breach for purposes of Section 6.1(a) and, in the
event of such a supplement, amendment or addition, Purchaser has the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c), if applicable. If,
however, the Closing occurs, any such supplement, amendment or addition will
be effective to cure and correct for all other purposes any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty, or covenant which would have
existed if such supplement, amendment or addition had not been made, and all
references to any part of the Disclosure Schedule which is supplemented or
amended shall for all purposes after the Closing be deemed to be a reference
to the Disclosure Schedule as so supplemented or amended.

 



 

5.9. _Restrictive Covenants._

 



 

(a) During the Restricted Period, Sellers will treat and hold as confidential
all of the Confidential Information of the Company and its Business, and the
terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in respect to the
Contemplated Transactions, refrain from using any of the Confidential
Information of the Company and its Business, and, subject to the other
provisions hereof, deliver promptly to Purchaser or destroy, at the request
and option of Purchaser, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the
Confidential Information of the Company and its Business which are in its
possession. In the event that any Seller is requested or required by any Legal
Requirement or Order to disclose any Confidential Information of the Company
and its Business, or the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and
in respect to the Contemplated Transactions, such Seller will notify Purchaser
promptly of the request or requirement so that Purchaser may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 5.9. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, such Seller is, on the advice of counsel, required by any
Legal Requirement or Order to disclose any Confidential Information of the
Company and its Business, or the terms and conditions contained in this
Agreement and in respect to the Contemplated Transactions, such Seller may
disclose the Confidential Information of the Company and its Business, or the
terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

Contemplated Transactions, as the case may be, as so required; _provided,
however,_ that such Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain, at the
reasonable request of Purchaser and at the sole expense of Purchaser, an order
or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
portion of the Confidential Information of the Company and its Business, or
the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in respect to the
Contemplated Transactions, as the case may be, required to be disclosed as
Purchaser shall designate.

 



 

(b) In order to induce Parent and Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, each
of Sellers expressly covenants and agrees that for a period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date
(the **" _Restricted Period_ "**), within the Territory, except with the prior
written consent of Purchaser, such Seller will not, either directly or
indirectly, on its own behalf, or in the service or on behalf of others,
engage in or provide managerial, supervisory, sales, marketing, or consulting
services or own (other than ownership of less than five percent (5%) of the
outstanding voting securities of an entity whose voting securities are traded
on a national securities exchange or quoted on the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System) a beneficial interest in,
any Person which is engaged in the Business, or is competitive with the
Company and the Business.

 



 

(c) During the Restricted Period, except with the prior written consent of
Purchaser, each of Sellers will not, directly or indirectly, for itself or for
any other Person, solicit any of the customers or vendors of the Company, who
were customers or vendors of the Company as of the Closing Date, for the
purpose of competing with Parent, Purchaser or the Company in the Business in
the Territory.

 



 

(d) During the Restricted Period, except with the prior written consent of
Purchaser, each of Sellers will not, directly or indirectly, for itself or for
any other Person, solicit, attempt to employ or enter into any contractual
employment or independent contractor arrangement with any employee or
independent contractor of the Company, who is an employee or independent
contractor of as of the Closing Date; _provided,_ that this Section 5.9(d)
shall not prohibit the solicitation or hiring of employees terminated by
Purchaser, Parent or the Company prior to such solicitation or hiring.

 



 

(e) Each Seller acknowledges that Parent and Purchaser have agreed to enter
into this Agreement based, in part, on each Sellers agreement to the
restrictive covenants contained in this Section 5.9. Each Seller also
acknowledges that the covenants contained in this Section 5.9 are reasonable
in scope and duration. If any covenant in this Section 5.9 is held to be
unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public policy, such covenant will be
considered to be divisible with respect to scope, time, and geographic area,
and such lesser scope, time or geographic area, or all of them, as a court of
competent jurisdiction may determine to be reasonable, not arbitrary, and not
against public policy, will be effective, binding, and enforceable against the
Parties. Each Seller agrees and acknowledges that money damages may not be an
adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Section 5.9 and that
Parent and Purchaser may in its sole discretion apply to any court of law or
equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive
relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this
Section 5.9. Each Seller hereby waives any requirement that Parent and
Purchaser post a bond or other security as a condition to receiving injunctive
relief hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

5.10. _Monthly Financial Statements._

 



 

Within twenty (20) days following the end of each calendar month prior to the
Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall deliver to Purchaser monthly
financial reports of the Company. Sellers covenant that such reports: (a) will
present fairly, in all material respects, the income and cash flows of the
Company, (b) will be prepared on a basis materially consistent with the
Financial Statements, and (c) will have been derived from the books and
records of the Company.

 



 

5.11. _Termination of Equity Rights._

 



 

Prior to the Closing Date (but subject to the payment contemplated by Section
2.4(d)(i)(C)), Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company to, take such action
as is necessary to terminate and cancel, effective no later than the Closing
Date, all outstanding Equity Rights of the Company in a manner that is binding
upon the holders of such Equity Rights and without liability to the Company
that has not been fully satisfied on the Closing Date.

 



 

5.12. _Audited Financial Statements._

 



 

Sellers shall, at the sole expense of Sellers, provide any reasonable
assistance requested by Parent to enable Parent to prepare historical
financial statements and pro forma financial information with respect to
periods prior to the Closing regarding the Company as required by Regulation
S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the timely filing of the
necessary financial statements and pro forma financial information with the
SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, including assisting in the preparation of such
audited or unaudited financial statements. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers
are solely responsible for the costs and expenses of preparing and delivering
to Parent no later than the thirty-fifth (35th) day following the Closing

the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 31,

with SEC Regulation S-X for filing in a Form 8-K. Sellers shall use their best
efforts to provide such assistance and information reasonably requested by
Deloitte LLP in the preparation of such financial statements.

 



 

5.13. _Confidentiality Agreement._

 



 

The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated February 4, 2013, by and
between the Company and Purchaser (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") are
hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and
effect until the Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement and the
obligations of Purchaser and Parent under this Section 5.13 shall terminate.
If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, then
the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

5.14. _Sponsored Employees._

 



 

(a) _Schedule 5.14(a)_ sets forth the foreign nationals currently being
sponsored by

 



      
 

 



 

the Company in non-immigrant visa status as well those employees currently
being sponsored or offered a future sponsorship for permanent residency
through the Company (the " _Foreign Nationals_ "). At the Closing, Purchaser
shall cause Altisource Solutions, Inc. to offer employment to the Foreign
Nationals who satisfactorily complete Altisource Solutions, Inc.s background
check (such Foreign Nationals who accept Altisource Solutions, Inc.s offer of
employment are referred to herein as the " _Retained Nationals_ "). It is
acknowledged that, under all circumstances, the Retained Nationals employed by
Altisource Solutions, Inc. shall be employed on an at-will basis. Purchaser
and Altisource Solutions, Inc. retain the right to make individual decisions
regarding the continued employment of all Retained Nationals by Altisource
Solutions, Inc. If such offer of employment is accepted by any Retained
Nationals, then the Company shall cease to serve, and Purchaser agrees to
cause Altisource Solutions, Inc. to commence to serve, as the sponsoring and
petitioning employer for U.S. immigration Law purposes with respect to such
Retained Nationals for US Immigration law purposes.

 



 

(b) In respect of the important contributions made by the Retained Nationals
from and after the Closing, Purchaser agrees to cause Altisource Solutions,
Inc. to: (i) abide by the conditions agreed to in such Retained Nationals
labor condition applications and permanent labor certifications filed by the
Company, (ii) continue to support, extend and/or amend when necessary such
applications under the same terms originally offered to such Retained
Nationals by the Company, (iii) assume all immigration-related obligations and
liabilities of the Company that have arisen or will hereafter arise in
connection with the submission of petitions, applications or other filings
with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (" _USCIS_ "), U.S.
Department of Labor (" _DOL_ ") or the U.S. Department of State (including any
U.S. embassy abroad or consular post) requesting the granting of employment-
based non-immigrant and immigrant visa benefits on behalf of such Retained
Nationals and liabilities associated with the jobs offered to such Retained
Nationals who seek to preserve their immigration benefits and (iv) file the
necessary immigrant visa petitions and other documentary evidence with the
USCIS, DOL and other Governmental Bodies to establish a successor-in-interest
relationship with such Retained Nationals and demonstrate (A) that the job
opportunity offered by Altisource Solutions, Inc. is the same as the job
opportunity originally offered by the Company; (B) that the job opportunity
previously offered by the Company to each such Retained National in the
applicable labor certification application was continuously valid before, and
remains continuously valid after, the Closing and (C) the transactions
contemplated hereby were successfully contemplated.

 



 

(c) Purchaser agrees to cause Altisource Solutions, Inc. to take all
reasonably necessary steps after the Closing to ensure that the foregoing
agreement is properly effectuated, including, without limitation, by asserting
to the appropriate Governmental Body that continued immigration benefits on
the basis of an immigration-related successorship interest is warranted with
respect to such Retained Nationals and filing new petitions for an alien
worker where and when deemed necessary by the relevant immigration
regulations. The Parties intend that Altisource Solutions, Inc. pursuant to
its agreements set forth in this Section shall be considered the successor-in-
interest to the Company solely and exclusively for U.S. immigration Law
purposes with respect to the Retained Nationals. Upon Closing, the Purchaser
agrees to cause Altisource Solutions, Inc. to effectuate all necessary actions
to ensure continuity of employment for the sponsored Retained Nationals.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor Altisource Solutions,
Inc. assumes any other actual or contingent immigration liabilities of the
Company pursuant to this Section except as expressly set forth herein.

been waived by Purchaser or, where cure is possible, been cured within fifteen
(15) days after Purchaser provides written notice thereof to the Seller
Representative;

 



 

(b) by the Seller Representative, if a material breach of any provision of
this Agreement has been committed by Purchaser or Parent prior to the Closing,
and such breach has not been waived by the Seller Representative or, where
cure is possible, been cured within fifteen (15) days after the Seller
Representative provides written notice thereof to Parent and Purchaser;

 



 

(c) by Purchaser by providing written notice to the Seller Representative if

however,_ that for purposes of determining the satisfaction of such condition,
such supplement shall not be considered;

 



 

(d) by mutual consent of Purchaser and the Seller Representative prior to the
Closing;

 



       
 

 



 

(e) by Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred (other than through the

this Agreement) on or before December 31, 2013, or such later date as the
Parties may agree upon in writing; or

 



 

(f) by the Seller Representative if the Closing has not occurred (other than
through the failure of any Seller to comply fully with its respective

7.2. _Effect of Termination._

 



 

Each Partys right of termination under Section 7.1 is in addition to any
other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise
of a right of termination will not be an election of remedies. If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, all further obligations of
the Parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that the obligations
in Section 5.9(a) (as it relates to this Agreement), Section 5.13, and Section
9 will survive; _provided, however,_ that if this Agreement is terminated by a
Party because of the breach of the Agreement by the other Party or because one
or more of the conditions to the terminating Partys obligations under this
Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the other Partys failure to comply
with its obligations under this Agreement, the terminating Partys right to
pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.

and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation. Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the waiver
of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or
on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not
affect the right to indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based
on such representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations.

with respect to the Operational Representations, unless on or before the later

any time, subject to the applicable statute of limitations.

8.4. _Limitations on and Qualifications to Indemnification._

 



 

(a) Solely with respect to any breach of the Operational Representations,

matter of a claim for indemnification or reimbursement hereunder, each
representation and warranty in this Agreement shall be read without regard and
without giving effect to the term "material," "in all material respects,"
"Material Adverse Effect," or similar phrases contained in such representation
or warranty which has the effect of making such representation and warranty
less restrictive.

 



 

(d) For purposes of determining the amount of any Damages, there shall be
deducted: (i) the amount of any insurance benefits and proceeds actually paid
to the indemnified party or any Affiliate thereof in respect of the Damages
(net of any deductible amounts), and (ii) any indemnification, contribution or
other similar payment actually recovered by the indemnified party or any
Affiliate thereof from any third party with respect thereto. Any such amounts
or benefits received by an indemnified party or any Affiliate thereof with
respect to any indemnity claim after it has received an indemnity payment
hereunder shall be promptly paid over to the indemnifying party.

 



 

(e) If the amount to be netted hereunder from any indemnification payment
required hereunder is determined after payment by an indemnifying Party of any
amount otherwise required to be paid as indemnification pursuant hereto, the
indemnified Party shall repay, promptly after such determination, any amount
that any indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant hereto had such
determination been made at the time of such payment.

 



 

(f) No Seller shall have any liability for any Damages to the extent that an
allowance, provision or reserve covering such Damages is included in the Net
Working Capital of the Company as of the Effective Time (as finally
determined).

 



 

(g) Except for injunctive and provisional relief, and except in the case of
fraud or

 



      
 

 



 

intentional misrepresentation, following the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy for any and all claims arising under, out of, or related to this
Agreement, or the sale and purchase of the Shares, shall be the rights of
indemnification set forth in this Section 8, and no Person will have any other
entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, it
being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are
expressly waived and released by the Parties to the fullest extent permitted
by Legal Requirements.

 



 

(h) Upon making any payment to an indemnified Party for any indemnification
claim pursuant to this Section 8, the indemnifying Party shall be subrogated,
to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the indemnified Party may
have against any third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying
such indemnification claim and the indemnified Party shall assign any such
rights to the indemnifying Party.

 



 

8.5. _Right of Set-Off._

 



 

The McKinley Group and the Saitta Group acknowledge that, in the event of a
breach of any provision of this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall have the
right to set-off any money damages suffered by Parent and Purchaser from any
amounts otherwise payable by Parent, Purchaser or their Affiliates to such
Seller pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document,
including, without limitation, any Price Adjustment, any Earn-Out Payments,
and, if allowed pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, any salary or other
compensation; _provided, however,_ that in the absence of a final judicial
determination that a Seller owes Damages that are being set off, Parent and
Purchaser shall pay all amounts so set off into an independent third-party
escrow until a final judicial determination with respect thereto is obtained.

 



 

8.6. _Procedure for Indemnification  Third Party Claims._

 



 

(a) Promptly after receipt of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding
against an indemnified party under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 that involves an
assertion of a claim from a third party, such indemnified party will, if a
claim is to be made against an indemnifying party (other than a Tax Contest,
which is governed by Section 5.7(c) hereof), give notice to the indemnifying
party of the commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the
indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability
that it may have to any indemnified party, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced
by the indemnifying partys failure to give such notice. Any notice of a
claim, event or matter as to which indemnity may be sought will include a
reasonably detailed description of such claim, event or matter, the basis of
the claim for indemnification, copies of material documentation reasonably
accessible to or in the possession of the indemnified party that the
indemnified party believes supports such claim for indemnification and a good
faith estimate (if capable of then being estimated) of the amount of Damages
incurred or which reasonably could be expected to be incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with such claim.

 



 

(b) If any Proceeding referred to in Section 8.6(a) is brought against an
indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will, unless the claim
involves Taxes or the assertion of

 



      
 

 



 

criminal liability, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the
extent that it wishes (unless the indemnifying party is also a party to such
Proceeding and determines in good faith after consultation with counsel that
joint representation would be inappropriate), to assume the defense of such
Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and,
after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its
election to assume the defense of such Proceeding. The indemnifying party will
not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
indemnified party under this Section 8 for any fees of other counsel or any
other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense
of such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be
conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made
in that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification;
(ii) the Party controlling defense shall keep the other Party reasonably
informed of the status thereof and may not compromise or settle such claims
without the other Partys consent; _provided, however_ , that the indemnifying
Party may compromise or settle such claims without the indemnified Partys
consent if (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal
Requirements or any violation of the rights of any Person by the indemnified
Party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the indemnifying Party. If notice is given to an indemnifying party of
the commencement of any Proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, by the
date which is ten (10) days prior to the date upon which the indemnified party
is required to provide its first response to the claims which are the subject
of such Proceeding (subject to any extensions to such response time actually
obtained), give notice to the indemnified party of its election to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will be bound by any
determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise or settlement effected
by the indemnified party.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may materially
adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary
damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding,
but the indemnifying party will not be bound by any determination of a
Proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its
consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).

 



 

8.7. _Procedure for Indemnification  Other Claims._

 



 

A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim
or a Tax Contest shall be asserted by notice to the party from whom
indemnification is sought promptly after the party seeking indemnification
becomes aware of any such claim, event or matter as to which indemnity may be
sought, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the
indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party,
except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense
of such action is prejudiced by the indemnifying partys failure to give such
notice. Any notice of a claim, event or matter as to which indemnity may be
sought will include a reasonably detailed description of such claim, event or
matter, the basis of the claim for indemnification, copies of material
documentation reasonably accessible to or in the possession of the indemnified
party that the

 



      
 

 



 

indemnified party believes supports such claim for indemnification and a good
faith estimate (if capable of then being estimated) of the amount of Damages
incurred or which reasonably could be expected to be incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with such claim. Any disputes with respect to
such claim shall be handled in accordance with the dispute resolution
provisions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

8.8. _Escrow Agreement._

 



 

As security for the indemnification obligations of Sellers under this
Agreement, Parent, Purchaser, the Seller Representative, and the Escrow Agent
shall enter into the Escrow Agreement as of the Closing Date, which shall be
funded at Closing with: (a) ten percent (10%) of the Cash Payment, and (b) ten
percent (10%) of the total number of shares or units of Restricted Stock
included in the Stock Payment (collectively, the **" _Escrow Funds_ "**). The
Escrow Funds shall be held until the later of: (x) six (6) weeks following the
delivery by Parents outside accounting firm to Parent of certified audited
financial statements of Parent and its subsidiaries and Affiliates with
respect to fiscal year 2014 or (y) the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing
Date; _provided, however,_ that the then-remaining amount of the Escrow Funds
less (A) five percent (5%) of the Cash Payment, less (B) five percent (5%) of
the total number of shares or units of Restricted Stock included in the Stock
Payment, less (C) the amount of any pending claims for Damages asserted by
Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement, shall be released to Sellers (or
to Vella as directed by Sellers) on the later of (i) six (6) weeks following
the delivery by Parents outside accounting firm to Parent of certified
audited financial statements of Parent and its subsidiaries and Affiliates
with respect to fiscal year 2013 or (ii) the first (1st) anniversary of the
Closing Date. Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall notify Escrow
Agent of the foregoing release dates promptly upon the occurrence thereof. The
unsatisfied claims for Damages asserted by Purchaser prior to the foregoing
release dates shall remain in escrow pending resolution of such claims. For
the purpose of calculating disbursements of the Escrow Funds, the shares or
units of Restricted Stock held as part of the Escrow Funds shall be valued at
the Closing Stock Price. Amounts held under the Escrow Agreement shall be the
exclusive source of indemnification for breaches of any of the Operational
Representations, but otherwise shall be a non-exclusive source of
indemnification hereunder.

Any action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of this Agreement or
any right arising out of this Agreement, shall be brought against any of the

THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY

9.5. _Further Assurances._

 



 

The Parties agree, without further compensation, (a) to furnish upon
reasonable request to each other such further information, (b) to execute and

9.6. _Waiver._

 



 

The rights and remedies of the Parties are cumulative and not alternative.
Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power,
or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no
single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will
preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or
the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent

of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be
discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of
the claim or right unless in writing signed by each other Party; (b) no waiver
that may be given by a Party will be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one Party
will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such Party or of the right
of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without
notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in
this Agreement.

 



 

9.7. _Entire Agreement and Modification._

 



 

This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements between the Parties (except for
confidentiality agreements or similar agreements executed with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions) with respect to its subject matter and constitutes
(along with the documents referred to in this Agreement) a complete and
exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the Parties with
respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended

 



      
 

 



 

except by a written agreement executed by each of the Parties.

 



 

9.8. _Disclosure Schedule._

 



 

(a) The disclosures in the Disclosure Schedule shall relate only to the
representations and warranties in the Section of the Agreement to which they
expressly relate or to which their relevance is reasonably apparent on the
face thereof.

 



 

(b) It is specifically acknowledged that the Disclosure Schedule may expressly
provide exceptions to a particular Section of this Agreement notwithstanding
that the Section does not state "except as set forth in _Schedule_  " or
words of similar effect.

 



 

(c) In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of
this Agreement and those in the Disclosure Schedule (other than an exception
expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Schedule with respect to a
specifically identified representation or warranty), the statements in the
body of this Agreement will control.

 



 

(d) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Disclosure Schedule is intended to vary the definition of "Material
Adverse Effect" or to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or
the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Party
shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of
any such item in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the
Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other
items or matters, are or are not in the Ordinary Course, and no Party shall
use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter
in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure
Schedule is or is not in the Ordinary Course for purposes of this Agreement.
Certain matters set forth in the Disclosure Schedule are included for
informational purposes only notwithstanding that, because they do not rise
above applicable materiality thresholds or otherwise, they may not be required
by the terms of this to be set forth herein.

 



 

(e) No due diligence conducted by Parent or Purchaser shall limit or be used
as a defense by Sellers with respect to any claim of breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant by Sellers under this Agreement.

 



 

9.9. _Assignments, Successors, and No Third-Party Rights._

 



 

No Party may assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
without the prior consent of the other Parties, except that Parent and
Purchaser may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate
of Parent and Purchaser without the consent of Sellers, but no such assignment
will release Parent and Purchaser from any obligations hereunder. This
Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the
benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties and the
Company. Nothing

 



      
 

 



 

expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person other than the Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim
under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.
This Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

9.10. _Severability._

 



 

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any
court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will
remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid
or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect
to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

 



 

9.11. _Section Headings; Construction._

 



 

The headings of Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only
and will not affect its construction or interpretation. All references to
"Section" or "Sections" refer to the corresponding Section or Sections of this
Agreement. All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such
gender or number as the circumstances require. Unless otherwise expressly
provided, the word "including" does not limit the preceding words or terms.

 



 

9.12. _Time of Essence._

 



 

With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this
Agreement, time is of the essence.

 



 

9.13. _Governing Law._

 



 

This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without
regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof.

 



 

9.14. _Specific Performance._

 



 

Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other Party would be
damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are
breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that the other Party shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent such breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any action instituted in any court of the
United States or any state thereof having, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter, in addition to
any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.

 



 

9.15. _Counterparts._

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (and by facsimile
copy), each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement
and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and
the same agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

9.16. _Seller Representative._

 



 

(a) Each of Sellers hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Seller
Representative, acting as hereinafter provided, as its attorney-in-fact and
agent in its name, place and stead in connection with the provisions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement that contemplate action by the Seller
Representative, and acknowledges that such appointment is coupled with an
interest. By executing and delivering this Agreement, the Seller
Representative hereby (i) accepts his appointment and authorization as Seller
Representative to act as attorney-in-fact and agent in the name, place and
stead of each of Sellers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and
(ii) agrees to perform his duties and obligations hereunder.

 



 

(b) Each Seller authorizes the Seller Representative in the name and on behalf
of such Seller:

 



 

(i) to give and receive any notice required or permitted under this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(ii) to interpret the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the documents
to be executed and delivered by Sellers in connection herewith, including the
Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(iii) to exercise any rights and to take any action required or permitted to
be taken by the Seller Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement;

 



 

(iv) to execute and deliver and receive deliveries of all agreements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers,
undertakings, amendments, and other documents required or permitted to be
given in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(v) to dispute or to refrain from disputing any claim made by Parent and
Purchaser under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(vi) to negotiate and compromise any dispute which may arise, and to exercise
or refrain from exercising remedies available under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and to sign any releases or other documents with respect to
any such dispute or remedy;

 



 

(vii) to authorize delivery to Purchaser of the Escrow Funds or any portion
thereof in satisfaction of claims brought by Purchaser or Parent for Damages
or to object to such deliveries;

 



 

(viii) to distribute the Escrow Funds and any earnings and proceeds thereon;
and

 



 

(ix) to give such instructions and to do such other things and refrain from
doing such other things as the Seller Representative shall deem necessary or

 



      
 

 



 

appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and any other
agreements, instruments and documents delivered or to be delivered by or on
behalf of such Seller pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(c) Each of Sellers agrees to be bound by all agreements and determinations
made, and agreements, documents and instruments negotiated, executed and
delivered by the Seller Representative under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Each of Sellers hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Seller
Representative is authorized to act in its name and on its behalf.
Notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among Sellers and/or the Seller
Representative, Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled in good faith to rely
on any and all action taken by the Seller Representative under this Agreement
and the other agreements, instruments and documents to be delivered by or on
behalf of Sellers pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to, or
obligation to inquire of, any of Sellers. Parent and Purchaser are hereby
expressly authorized in good faith to rely on the genuineness of the
signatures of the Seller Representative, and upon receipt of any writing which
reasonably appears to have been signed by the Seller Representative, Parent
and Purchaser may act upon the same in good faith without any further duty of
inquiry as to the genuineness of the writing.

 



 

(e) If Saitta, as the Seller Representative, ceases to function for any reason
whatsoever, then Vella shall serve as the successor Seller Representative; if
Vella ceases to function as the Seller Representative for any reason
whatsoever, then Sellers by mutual agreement may appoint a successor;
_provided, however_ , that if for any reason no successor has been appointed
pursuant to the foregoing within thirty (30) days, then Parent and Purchaser
shall have the right but not the obligation to petition a court of competent
jurisdiction for appointment of a successor. Each successor Seller
Representative, if required to serve, shall sign an acknowledgment in writing
agreeing to perform and be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement
applicable to the Seller Representative. Each successor Seller Representative
shall have all of the power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by
this Agreement upon the original Seller Representative, and the term "Seller
Representative" as used herein shall be deemed to include any successor Seller
Representative.

 



 

(f) The authorization of the Seller Representative shall be effective until
such rights and obligations under this Agreement terminate by virtue of the
termination of any and all obligations of Sellers hereunder.

 



 

(g) Service by the Seller Representative shall be without compensation except
for the reimbursement by Sellers of out-of-pocket expenses and indemnification
specifically provided herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Seller Representative shall have no duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on
behalf of any Seller shall otherwise exist against the Seller Representative.

 



 

The Seller Representative shall not be liable to Sellers for any acts or
omissions under this Section 9.16 except to the extent it is finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing
evidence that the actions taken by the Seller Representative constituted

 



      
 

 



 

gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Seller agrees to indemnify and to
save and hold harmless the Seller Representative of, from, against and in
respect of any claim, action, cause of action, cost, liability or expense
suffered or incurred by or asserted against the Seller Representative based
upon or arising out of the performance by the Seller Representative of any
act, matter or thing pursuant to the appointment herein made, except that no
Seller shall be held or required to indemnify or to save or hold harmless the
Seller Representative to the extent it is finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the actions taken
by the Seller Representative constituted gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Seller Representative shall be protected in acting upon any
notice, statement or certificate believed by the Seller Representative to be
genuine and to have been furnished by the appropriate Person and in acting or
refusing to act in good faith on any matter. Except with respect to fraud or
willful misconduct, neither the Seller Representative nor any agent employed
by the Seller Representative shall be liable to Parent, Purchaser or any of
their Affiliates solely by reason of the performance of Seller
Representatives duties hereunder.
