for said  purpose, subject to Section 1.13; (ii) stock  certificates
representing the Buyer Shares (other  than Escrow Shares) registered in each

which shall be agreed upon by the parties  at the Closing and which shall be

(ii) Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent stock  certificates representing

to have been delivered at or prior to the  Effective Time by the Company or
the Shareholders  pursuant to this Agreement.  1.8 MERGER CONSIDERATION,
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   The total consideration to be paid by Buyer in
the Merger shall be  $275,000,000 (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION") consisting of
(a) $40,000,000  payable in cash (the "CASH CONSIDERATION") and (b)
$235,000,000 (the  "STOCK Consideration") payable in the form of Buyer
Subordinate Voting  Shares (the "BUYER SHARES"). The aggregate number of
Buyer Shares  payable shall be determined by dividing the Stock Consideration
by the  Closing Price. The "CLOSING Price" shall be the average closing
price  of Buyer Subordinate Voting Shares for the five trading days ending 
with the day immediately preceding the Closing, as reported by the  Nasdaq
National Market; provided, however, that for purposes of this  Agreement, if
the Closing Price is less than 90% of the Signing Price,  the Closing Price
shall be 90% of the Signing Price, and if the Closing  Price is greater than
110% of the Signing Price, the Closing Price  shall be 110% of the Signing
Price. The "SIGNING PRICE" is $38.125,  representing the closing price of the
Buyer Subordinate Voting Shares,  as reported by the Nasdaq National Market,
at closing of trading on  October 31, 2000. If, prior to the Closing, there
is any stock  dividend, stock split or other change in the character or
amount of the  outstanding     - 5 -   Buyer Subordinate Voting Shares,
then in such event any and all new,  substituted or additional securities to
which the Shareholders would  have been entitled by reason of their ownership
of the Buyer Shares had  the Closing occurred prior to such event shall be
considered Buyer  Shares for purposes of this Agreement and the consideration
to be  received by each Shareholder shall be adjusted accordingly. At the 
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on  the
part of Buyer, Buyer Sub or the Company, the shares of Company  Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to Closing shall  be conceded and
extinguished and shall be converted into the right to  receive the Merger
Consideration, such that each share of Company  Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time shall be converted into
the right to receive eight hundred dollars  ($800), plus a pro-rata portion
of the Stock Consideration  (collectively, the "EXCHANGE RATIO"). Each share
of common stock, par  value of $0.001 per share of Buyer Sub issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and  shall become one validly issued fully paid and non-assessable share of 
Surviving Corporation Common Stock as of the Effective Time, and the 
Surviving Corporation shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer.  In
exchange for and in consideration of the issuance of the Merger 
Consideration, Buyer will be entitled to subscribe and undertakes and  agrees
to subscribe, at the Effective Time, for the Surviving  Corporation Common
Stock. The Surviving Corporation Common Stock will  at the Effective Time
have been duly authorized and, when issued to  Buyer, will be validly issued
and outstanding as fully paid and  non-assessable. The number of shares of
Company Common Stock held by  each Shareholder and to be converted into the
right to receive the  Merger Consideration is set forth opposite each
Shareholder\'s name on  Exhibit C. Subject to the escrow provisions of
Section 1.9, the Merger  Consideration shall be payable to the Shareholders
pro rata, determined  by multiplying such Merger Consideration by a fraction,
the numerator  of which is the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned
by the  Shareholder and the denominator of which is the total number of
issued  and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. No fraction of a
share  of Buyer Subordinate Voting Shares shall be issued, and each
fractional  share thereof shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.
Until  surrendered and exchanged, each outstanding certificate which, prior
to  the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock shall be 
deemed to represent and evidence only the right to receive the Merger 
Consideration to be paid therefore as set forth in this Section 1.8. No 
interest shall accrue or be payable with respect to any Cash  Consideration
which any Shareholder shall be entitled to receive. Buyer  shall be
authorized to pay Merger Consideration attributable to any  certificate
theretofore issued which has been lost or destroyed, upon  receipt of
satisfactory evidence of ownership of the shares of Company  Common Stock
represented thereby and of appropriate indemnification. It  being agreed that
the Merger Consideration received by Messrs. Farrell  and Gornall shall be
reduced on a dollar for dollar basis equal to six  (6) months their
respective annual remuneration in the event that  Messrs. Farrell or Gornall
terminate unilaterally     - 6 -   their respective employment agreement
with the Surviving Corporation  prior to the second anniversary of the
Effective Time.  1.9 ESCROW ARRANGEMENTS   Simultaneously with the Merger
and at the Effective Time, an aggregate  15% of the Stock Consideration will
be delivered to the Escrow Agent  (as such term is defined in the Escrow
Agreement attached hereto as  Exhibit D (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT")). Such
shares of Buyer Shares shall  constitute an escrow fund (the "ESCROW FUND")
to be governed by the  terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement. The portion
of the Escrow Fund  contributed on behalf of each of the Shareholders shall
be in  proportion to the Merger Consideration which such holder would 
otherwise be entitled under Section 1.8. The Escrow Fund shall  terminate in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The  provisions of the
Escrow Agreement shall govern in the event of any  conflict between the
Escrow Agreement and this Section 1.9. The  Shareholders may withdraw shares
of Buyer Shares (the "WITHDRAWN  SHARES") and substitute cash in lieu thereof
at any time, provided that  the amount deposited in substitution for the
Withdrawn Shares is equal  to the product of (i) the Closing Price, and (ii)
the number of  Withdrawn Shares.  1.10 STOCK PURCHASE   At the Closing,
May and Klimasewski shall sell to the Surviving  Corporation, and the
Surviving Corporation shall purchase from May and  Klimasewski, all of their
right, title and interest in and to the  shares of the Subsidiaries held by
them (the "STOCK PURCHASE"). The  price for the shares to be acquired in the
Stock Purchase shall be one  dollar (the "STOCK PURCHASE
CONSIDERATION").  1.11 REDEMPTION OF IDA BONDS AND PURCHASE OF FISHERS\'
ASSETS   Immediately after the Closing, May and Klimasewski shall cause
the  Fishers Development Company, a New York general partnership, all of
the  equity which is owned by Klimasewski and May ("FISHERS") to require
the  Ontario County Industrial Development Agency ("COUNTY") to redeem (the 
"REDEMPTION") the $1,350,000 Ontario County Industrial Development  Agency
Multi-Mode Variable Rate Demand Industrial Development Revenue  Bonds, Series
2000 (the "IDA BONDS") in full in accordance with the  terms of such IDA
Bonds. Concurrently upon the Redemption, May and  Klimasewski shall cause
Fishers to sell the land, building (the  "BUILDING") and equipment
(collectively referred to as "FISHERS\'  Assets"), situated at 7647 County
Road 42, in the town of Fishers in  the State of New York, to be sold to the
Surviving Corporation at an  aggregate purchase price of $2,300,000. Such
Building shall be  renovated in accordance with the capital expenditures plan
described in  Section 2.23 hereof.     - 7 -  1.12 TRANSFER TAXES.  
All stamp, transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration, recordation  and
other such taxes and fees incurred in connection with this  Agreement
(collectively, "TRANSFER TAXES") shall be paid by the  Shareholders and the
Shareholders shall, at their own expense, prepare  and properly file accurate
tax returns and other documentation with  respect to the Transfer Taxes on a
timely basis.  1.13 PAYMENT OF EXPENSES.   At the Closing, the Buyer
hereby agrees to pay directly, on behalf of  the Shareholders, the investment
banking and legal fees incurred by or  on behalf of the Shareholders in
connection with the transactions  contemplated hereby (collectively, the
"EXPENSES"). At the Closing, the  Buyer shall pay the Expenses in cash, in
the currency requested by the  service provider, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. Such  payment of Expenses made by the Buyer
shall be deducted from the Cash  Consideration payable hereunder. The
Shareholders shall, at least two  business days prior to the Closing Date,
advise the Buyer in writing of  the amount of the Expenses, together with
wire transfer instructions  for such payments.   ARTICLE 2

purposes of this Agreement, "COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT"  means any
change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts  (or any development that
has had or is reasonably likely to  have any change or effect) that is
materially adverse to the  business, financial condition or results of
operations of the     - 8 -   Company, taken as a whole, provided,
however, any adverse  change, effect or circumstance (a) primarily arising
out of or  resulting primarily from actions contemplated by the parties 
hereto in connection with this Agreement, (b) resulting from  economic
factors affecting the economy as a whole or (c)  resulting from factors
generally affecting the specific  markets in which the Company competes shall
not be deemed in  themselves, either alone or in combination, to constitute,
and  shall not be taken into account in determining whether there  has been,
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The execution and  delivery by the Company
of this Agreement and the consummation  by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby have  been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate  action on the part of the Company and no other corporate 
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to  authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions so  contemplated by this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly  and validly executed and delivered
by the Company and the  Shareholders, and assuming this Agreement constitutes
a valid  and binding obligation of the Buyer and Buyer Sub, this  Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the  Company and the
Shareholders enforceable against the Company  and the Shareholders in
accordance with its terms, subject,  however, as to enforcement, to
bankruptcy, insolvency,  fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar  laws of general applicability relating to or affecting  creditor\'s
rights and to general principles of equity,  regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in  equity or at law. The Company is not in
violation of any of  the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation, by-
laws or  other organizational documents or laws applicable to it,  except
for violations which could not reasonably be expected  to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.  2.2 SUBSIDIARIES   Schedule 2.2 sets forth, for
each Subsidiary: (a) its name and  jurisdiction of incorporation; (b) the
number of shares of authorized  capital stock of each class of its capital

Subsidiary is duly qualified to conduct business and is in corporate  good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the nature  of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes  such
qualification necessary, except for any such failures to be  qualified that
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect.
Neither of the Subsidiaries currently has any  active business operations,
nor have had any active business operations  in the previous three years. No
Subsidiary is in default under     - 9 -   or in violation of any
provision of its organizational documents or  under any statutes or

each Subsidiary are duly authorized, validly  issued, fully paid, non-
assessable and free of pre-emptive rights. All  shares of each Subsidiary
that are held of record or owned beneficially  by the Company are held or
owned free and clear of any Liens or other  restrictions on transfer (other
than restrictions under applicable  securities laws). There are no
outstanding or authorized options,  warrants, rights, agreements or
commitments to which the Company or any  Subsidiary is a party or which are
binding on any of them providing for  the issuance, disposition or
acquisition of any capital stock of any  Subsidiary. There are no outstanding
stock appreciation, phantom stock  or similar rights with respect to any
Subsidiary. There are no voting  trusts, proxies or other agreements or
understandings with respect to  the voting of any capital stock of any
Subsidiary to which the Company  or any Subsidiary is a party. Neither the
Subsidiaries nor the Company,  except for the Subsidiaries, own any stock,
partnership interest, joint  venture interest or any other security or
ownership interest issued by  any other corporation, organization, limited

stock or other  equity interest of the Subsidiaries are owned by the
Company,  Klimasewski or May, free and clear of all liens, charges,
encumbrances,  claims and options of any nature. The Company, Klimasewski and
May each  have full right power and authority to sell, transfer, assign and 
deliver the respective shares of capital stock or other equity interest  of
the Subsidiaries being sold by each of them to the Buyer. All of the 
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the 
Subsidiaries have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are  fully
paid and non-assessable.  2.3 CAPITALIZATION   The authorized, issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the  Company are as set forth on
Schedule 2.3. The outstanding shares of  Company Common Stock are duly and
validly authorized and issued, fully  paid and non-assessable and are owned
of record by the Shareholders as  set forth on Schedule 2.3 and represents

does not have  outstanding any options, warrants or other rights to acquire,
directly  or indirectly, capital stock from the Company, and the Company does
not  have any obligation to repurchase or redeem any capital stock of the 
Company. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.3, the Company is not party  to
any agreement, and, to the Shareholders\' Knowledge, there is no  agreement
between any Persons, which grants any rights of first refusal  or pre-emptive
rights or relates to the voting or giving of written  consents with respect
to any security or by a director of the Company  or its Subsidiaries.  2.4
NO BREACH   Except as set forth on Schedule 2.4, the execution and delivery
of this  Agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement  will not conflict with, or     - 10 -   result in any
violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse  of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination,  cancellation or acceleration
of any obligation, or result in the  creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to,
any provision of: (i)  the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the
Company or any  provision of the comparable organizational documents of any
of its  Subsidiaries; (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage,  indenture, lease or other agreement, instrument, permit,

Company or its Subsidiaries or the properties or assets of the  Company or
its Subsidiaries, other than, with respect to any of the  matters described

Company Material Adverse Effect, or  prevent or materially delay the
consummation of any of the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement.  2.5 SHARE OWNERSHIP   Except as set forth on Schedule 2.5,
each Shareholder has full right,  power and authority to sell, transfer,

and  valid title to such shares, free and clear of all Liens and 
restrictions on transfer (other than restrictions on transfer imposed  by
applicable securities laws). There are no outstanding options,  warrants,
convertible securities, calls, rights, commitments,  pre-emptive rights or
agreements or instruments or understandings of  any character to which such
Shareholder is a party, obligating such  Shareholder to deliver or sell, or
cause to be delivered or sold,  contingently or otherwise, such shares of
Company Common Stock. There  are no voting trust agreements or other
contracts, agreements,  arrangements, commitments, plans or understandings to
which such  Shareholder is a party restricting or otherwise relating to

"GOVERNMENTAL  ENTITY"), is required by or with respect to the Company and
its  Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this 
Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company and its 
Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except  for

to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the  aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse  Effect or prevent
or materially delay the consummation of any of the  transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Neither the execution and  delivery of this Agreement by
any Shareholder nor the consummation of  the transactions contemplated hereby
by any Shareholder will (1)  conflict with, result in a breach or violation
of or constitute (or  with notice or lapse of time or both constitute) a
default under any  law, statute, regulation, order, judgment or decree or any
instrument,  contract or other agreement to which any Shareholder is a party
or by  which any Shareholder is bound, or (2) require such Shareholder to 
obtain any authorization, consent, approval or waiver from, give 
notification to, or make any filing with, any Governmental Entity, or  to
obtain the approval or consent of any other Person, except for such 
conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults, or any authorization,  consent,
approval, waiver, notification or filing the failure of which  to obtain or
make, will not (x) impair in any material respect the  ability of such
Shareholder to perform such Shareholder\'s obligations  under this Agreement
or (y) prevent or materially delay the  consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement,
"PERSON" means an individual or  corporation, partnership, trust,

or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened against the Company  or the
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or business  that
questions the validity of this Agreement, or the right of the  Company to
enter into this Agreement or to consummate the transactions  contemplated
hereby or that, individually or in the aggregate, would  reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There  is no judgment,
decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental  Entity outstanding
against the Company or the Subsidiaries having or  reasonably likely to have,
in the future, any such effect.  2.8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   The

inaccurate.  2.9 NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES   (a) None of the Company and

incurred in the ordinary course  of business which are not required by GAAP
to be reflected on  a balance sheet.   (b) The Shareholders may not evade
their liability under the  warranty undertakings made under the terms of this
Agreement  or the resulting financial liability by pleading ignorance of 
the facts in question.   (c) Any enquiry carried out by the Buyer and/or by
representatives  or advisers of the Buyer, or anyone whomsoever from the

the  aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse 
Effect, there is no existing default thereunder or breach thereof by  the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by any other party thereto,  or any
conditions which, with the passage of time or the giving of  notice or both,
might reasonably constitute such a default by the  Company, such
Subsidiaries, or by any other party to a Company Contract  and, except as set
forth in Schedule 2.15(a), none of the Company  Contracts will be breached by
or give any other party a right of  termination as a result of the

Subsidiaries are bound by any non-competition,  affirmative or restrictive
covenant limiting the nature of the business  that any such corporation can

and of the Subsidiaries can be  operated. Neither the Company nor the
Subsidiaries knows of any bid or  contract proposal made by the Company or

liability and all other kinds of insurance held by the  Company in connection
with the conduct of its and its Subsidiaries\'  business and operations
(other than policies relating to Company  Plans). Such policies are in full
force and effect and, to the  Company\'s Knowledge, neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary is not in  default with respect to its obligations under any

Buyer as to be capable of  evaluating the merits and risks of an investment
in the Buyer  Shares. Such Shareholder has the financial ability to bear
the  economic risk of his investment in the Buyer Shares being  acquired
hereunder, has adequate means for providing for his  current needs and
contingencies and has no need for liquidity  with respect to his investment
in Buyer.   (b) Each Shareholder is acquiring the Buyer Shares for his own 
account, for investment purposes only, and not with the view  to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution  thereof. Such Shareholder
understands that the Buyer Shares  have not been distributed pursuant to a
prospectus in Canada  pursuant to applicable legislation and have not been 
registered under the SECURITIES ACT of 1933, as amended (the  "SECURITIES
ACT"), or under the securities laws of Canada, by  reason of a specified
exemption from the registration or  prospectus provisions thereunder which
depends upon, among  other things, the BONA FIDE nature of such
Shareholder\'s  investment intent as expressed herein. Such Shareholder 
acknowledges that his representations and warranties contained  herein are
being relied upon by Buyer as a basis for the  exemption of the issuance of
the Buyer     - 22 -   Shares hereunder from the registration
requirements of the  Securities Act and any applicable state securities
laws.   (c) Each Shareholder acknowledges that the Buyer Shares must be 
held indefinitely until they are subsequently registered under  the
Securities Act and under applicable state securities laws  or an exemption
from such registration is available. Such  Shareholder has been advised or is
aware of: (A) the  provisions of Rule 144 and Rule 145 promulgated under
the  Securities Act which permits limited resale of the securities 
purchased in a private placement subject to the satisfaction  of certain
conditions including, among other things, the  availability of certain
current public information about Buyer  and compliance with applicable
requirements regarding the  holding period and the amount of securities to be
sold and the  manner of sale and (B) Regulation S promulgated under the 
Securities Act or other applicable legislation which permits  resale of the
purchased securities in the United States or  Canada subject to certain
restrictions. Each Shareholder  understands that only Buyer can take action
to register the  Buyer Shares.   (d) Such Shareholder acknowledges that the
Buyer Shares must also  be held in accordance with applicable securities laws
in  Canada and the Shareholder undertakes not to sell, transfer or  assign
the Buyer Shares in contravention of the applicable  laws in force in
Canada.   (e) Each Shareholder or his representative has had an
opportunity  to discuss the Buyer\'s business, management, financial
affairs  and acquisition plans with its management, to review the  Buyer\'s
facilities, and to obtain such additional information  concerning such
Shareholder\'s investment in the Buyer Shares  in order for such Shareholder
to evaluate its merits and  risks, and such Shareholder has determined that
the Buyer  Shares are a suitable investment for such Shareholder and that 
at this time such Shareholder could bear a complete loss of  his
investment.   (f) Each Shareholder is aware that no U.S. or Canada
federal,  state, provincial or other agency has passed upon or made any 
finding or determination concerning the fairness of the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the adequacy of  the disclosure of the
exhibits and schedules hereto or  thereto.   (g) Each Shareholder
understands that all certificates for the  Buyer Shares issued to such
Shareholder shall bear a legend in  substantially the following form and
including such legend as  may be required under Canadian securities laws:

BUYER AND BUYER SUB  Buyer and Buyer Sub hereby jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the Company and the Shareholders, as of the date
hereof (except as to any representation or warranty which specifically

authority to own  and use its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as  currently conducted. Buyer and Buyer Sub are each duly qualified
to do  business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each 
jurisdiction in which the nature of their respective businesses  conducted or
property owned by each makes such qualification necessary,  except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing, as the  case may be, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material  Adverse Effect. For
purposes of this Agreement, "BUYER MATERIAL ADVERSE  EFFECT" means any
change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts  (or any development that
has had or is reasonably likely to have any  change or effect) that is
materially adverse to the business, financial  condition or results of

economic factors  affecting the economy as a whole; (c) resulting in changes
from the  market price or trading volume of the     - 28 -   Buyer
Subordinate Voting Shares; or (d) resulting from factors  generally affecting
the specific markets in which the Buyer and its  subsidiaries compete shall
not be deemed in themselves, either alone or  in combination, to constitute,
and shall not be taken into account in  determining whether there has been, a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect.  3.2 CAPITALIZATION   The authorized,
issued and outstanding shares of each class of capital  stock of Buyer and
Buyer Sub are as set forth in Exhibit C. Exhibit C  also sets forth the
number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to  the Buyer\'s duly

warrant, option,  convertible security or other right (contingent or
otherwise) to  purchase or acquire any shares of capital stock of Buyer or
Buyer Sub  is authorized or outstanding; (b) Buyer and Buyer Sub have no 
obligation (contingent or otherwise) to issue any subscription,  warrant,
option, convertible security or other such right or to issue  or distribute
to holders of any shares of their capital stock any  evidences of

series 1 of the Buyer of which 800,000 are issued and  outstanding, Buyer and

federal and state  securities laws or pursuant to valid exemptions
therefrom.  3.3 AUTHORIZATION   Buyer and Buyer Sub each have the
requisite corporate power and  authority to enter into and to consummate the
transactions contemplated  by this Agreement and otherwise to carry out their
obligations  hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Buyer  and Buyer Sub and the consummation by them of the transactions 
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action  on the

each of them in  accordance with its terms, subject, however, as to
enforcement, to  bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,

affecting  creditors\' rights and to general principles of equity, regardless
of  whether such     - 29 -   enforceability is considered in equity or
at law. Neither Buyer nor  Buyer Sub is in violation of any of the provisions
of its Certificate  of Incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents.  3.4 NON-CONTRAVENTION   Subject to regulatory approval under

or  acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, 
or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or  assets
of the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries (including Buyer Sub)  pursuant to,
any provision of: (a) the Certificate of Incorporation or  By-laws of the
Buyer or any provision of the comparable organizational  documents of Buyer

statute, law, rule, regulation,  judgment, order or decree applicable to the
Buyer or any of its  subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets,
other than, in  the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, any such conflicts,
violations,  defaults, rights or Liens that individually or in the aggregate

contemplated by this Agreement.  3.5 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS   No consent,

with, any Governmental Entity is required by or  with respect to the Buyer or

assets; (c) such  filings, consents, approvals, orders, registrations and
declarations as  may be necessary as a result of the issuance of the Buyer
Shares or any  facts or circumstances relating solely to the Company; and (d)
such  other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, 
declarations and filings the failure of which to be obtained or made  would
not,     - 30 -   individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a  Buyer Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially
delay the  consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  3.6 LITIGATION; PROCEEDINGS   There is no action, suit or
proceeding, governmental or otherwise,  pending or, to the Buyer\'s
Knowledge, threatened against the Buyer, any  of its subsidiaries (including
Buyer Sub) or any of their respective  properties or business that questions
the validity of this Agreement,  the right of the Buyer or Buyer Sub to enter
into this Agreement or to  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
or that, individually  or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Buyer  Material Adverse Effect. There is no judgment, decree,
injunction, rule  or order of any Governmental Entity outstanding against the
Buyer or  Buyer Sub or any of their subsidiaries having, or which, insofar
as  reasonably can be foreseen, in the future would have, any such
effect.  3.7 AUTHORIZATION FOR BUYER SHARES   Buyer has taken all

Company and each Shareholder each statement  and report, as may be required
to have been filed as of the date hereof  under Canadian securities laws (the

made, not  misleading, except to the extent corrected by a subsequently
filed  Canadian Document. The financial statements of Buyer being the 
consolidated audited balance sheets of the Buyer as at August 31, 1999  and

Canadian GAAP applied on a basis  consistent throughout the periods indicated
and consistent with each  other (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case  of unaudited statements included in the Buyer\'s
interim reports. The  balance sheets included in the Buyer Financial
Statements present  fairly in all material respects as of their respective
dates the  financial condition of the Buyer (subject, in the case of
interim  financial statements, to normal, recurring year-end adjustments
that  may be required upon audit).  3.9 NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES   None
of the Buyer and its subsidiaries (including Buyer Sub) have any  liability
(whether known or unknown, whether absolute or contingent,  whether

material to the Buyer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,  except for:
(a) liabilities shown on the latest balance sheet included  in the Canadian

to be reflected on a balance  sheet.  3.10 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR
EVENTS   Since the Buyer Balance Sheet Date, the Buyer has conducted its

account for  investment purposes only and not with a view to or for

securities  in compliance with applicable Canadian and U.S. federal and
state  securities laws.  3.12 EXPERIENCE OF THE BUYER   The Buyer,
through its representatives, has such knowledge,  sophistication and
experience in business and financial matters so as  to be capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective  investment in the Company
Shares and has so evaluated the merits and  risks of such investment.  3.13
BROKERS, FINDERS OR FINANCIAL ADVISORS   Except for the fees payable by
Buyer to Merrill Lynch, Pierre, Fenner and  Smith or any of its Affiliate, no
broker, investment broker, financial  advisor or other person     - 32
-   is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other 
similar fee or commission from Buyer in connection with the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  3.14 FULL DISCLOSURE   The Buyer has made
or caused to be made due enquiry with respect to  each of the
representations, warranties and statements contained in  this Agreement and
in each of the schedules, certificates, documents  and other writings
referred to herein or furnished to the Shareholders  and the Company

other public announcement  with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby  without the prior consent of Buyer (in the case of the
Shareholders or  the Company) or the Shareholders (in the case of Buyer),
which consent  shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that:
(a)  nothing herein will prohibit either party from issuing or causing 
publication of any such press release or public announcement to the  extent
that such party\'s counsel reasonably determines such action to  be required
by law, or the regulations of any government agency or the  principal
exchange or market on which Buyer Subordinate Voting Shares  are traded, in
which case the party making such determination will, to  the greatest extent
practicable in light of the circumstances, use best  efforts to allow the
other party reasonable time to comment on such  release or announcement in

Company.     - 35 -  4.3 NON-SOLICITATION; NON-NEGOTIATION   The
Company and the Shareholders agree that they will not, and they  will use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their  representatives, agents
or employees acting on their behalf, not to,  after the execution of this

assets  or stock, business combination, merger or other transaction, and
that  the Company and the Shareholders will promptly advise Buyer of the 
terms of any communications they may receive relating to any bid for  all or
any part of any such interest in the Company.  4.4 COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE
EFFORTS   Subject to the terms and conditions herein, each of the parties
hereto  agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to  be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done as promptly as 
practicable, all things necessary, proper and advisable under  applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including without  limitation, fulfilment of
the conditions to closing set forth herein.  If at any time after the Closing
any further action is necessary or  desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, including,  without limitation, the execution of additional
instruments, the proper  officers and directors of the Buyer and the Company
and the  Shareholders shall take all such necessary action.  4.5 HART-
SCOTT-RODINO ACT AND FOREIGN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS   (a) To the extent
required by law, each of the Company and the  Buyer and each of the
Shareholders shall (i) prepare and file  as promptly as practicable with the

by the HSR Act or the antitrust, competition  or comparable laws of any
foreign jurisdiction and each party  shall bear the expenses for the
preparation of their  documentation for the filing.     - 36 -   (b)
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company  and the Buyer
each agree to cooperate and to use their  respective commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any  government clearances required to consummate the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (including through compliance 
with the HSR Act), to respond to any requests for information  from
Governmental Entities, and to contest and resist any  action, including any
legislative, administrative or judicial  action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned  any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether  temporary, preliminary or permanent (an "ORDER") that  restricts,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including,  without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all
available  avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all  available

following actions to the extent  commercially reasonable to obtain the

applicable  law, consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in 
good faith the views of one another, in connection with any  analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,  arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on  behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings  under or relating to the HSR Act or any other
federal, state  or foreign antitrust or fair trade law. Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary in this section, neither the Company  nor the Buyer
shall be required to take any action that would  reasonably be expected to
substantially impair the overall  benefits expected, as of the date hereof,
to be realized from  the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement.  4.6 COVENANTS OF PARTIES   From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time  or the termination of this
Agreement, each of the parties to this  Agreement covenants and agrees that
it shall take no action which  would: (a) materially adversely affect the
ability of any party to this  Agreement to obtain any consents required for
the transactions  contemplated hereby; or (b) materially adversely affect the
ability of  any party to perform its covenants and agreements under this
Agreement.     - 37 -  4.7 MODIFICATION OF DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES   At
any time prior to four business days before the Effective Time, the  Company
and the Shareholders, by written notice to the Buyer, may amend  or
supplement the Disclosure Schedules attached to this Agreement with  respect
to any matter that, if existing or occurring at or prior to the  Effective
Time, would have been required to be set forth or described  in the
Disclosure Schedules or that is necessary to complete or correct  any
information in any representation or warranty contained in ARTICLE  2. The
Buyer shall have two business days to object in writing to such  amendment or
supplement. If such amendment or supplement is considered  by the Buyer as a
Company Material Adverse Effect then the Buyer shall  have the right to
terminate this Agreement as described in Section  8.1(d). If the Buyer does
not object within such two business day  period, then such amendment or
supplement shall be given effect for all  purposes of this Agreement.  4.8
CONTACT WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS   The Buyer (and all of its agents and
affiliates and any employees,  directors or officers thereof) will not
contact and communicate with  the employees, customers, suppliers and
licensors of the Company in  connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby unless it has  received the prior written consent of the Company,
which consent shall  not be unreasonably withheld but may be conditioned in
any reasonable  manner.  4.9 SECONDARY OFFERING   (a) THE BUYER
SHALL:   (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to file a 
registration statement on Form F-1 (the "SECONDARY  REGISTRATION STATEMENT")
with the SEC within 90 days  after the Closing in order to register the
resale by  the Shareholders of Buyer Shares in an underwritten  public
offering led by an underwriter selected by the  Buyer equal to any number of
Buyer Shares not subject  to the lock-up as set forth in Section 5.2(i) 
provided, however, that the aggregate market value of  the Buyer Shares
registered for resale shall not be  less than US$100,000,000 or more than
US$300,000,000  (including any over-allotment option) (based upon the 
average closing price quoted on the Nasdaq National  Market for the five
trading days ending on the fifth  day prior to the filing of such
Registration  Statement); and   (ii) upon the effectiveness of such
Registration  Statement, facilitate an underwritten secondary  public
offering (the "SECONDARY OFFERING") led by an  underwriter selected by the
Buyer of the     - 38 -   Buyer Shares registered under the Secondary 
Registration Statement;   (iii) have the right, however, to (A) postpone
such filing  of the Secondary Registration Statement or  facilitation of
such Secondary Offering for a period  of up to 90 days after the Closing if
the Buyer is  engaged in any bona fide proposal for a merger,  acquisition
or material financing which, in the good  faith determination of the Board of
Directors of the  Buyer, would be adversely affected by the  Registration
Statement or the Offering to the  material detriment of the Buyer, or (B)
need not make  such effort to file the Registration Statement or  facilitate
such Offering if the Board determines in  good faith after consulting with
the Buyer\'s  financial advisors that the Offering would materially 
adversely affect the existing shareholders of the  Buyer due to the capital
market conditions at such  time.   (b) In connection with the Secondary
Offering, the Buyer and the  Shareholders shall agree to execute an
underwriting agreement  with the underwriter of the Secondary Offering which
is  customary for secondary equity offerings, including 90-day  "market
stand-off" provisions.   (c) The Buyer shall be obligated to pay any
expenses incurred in  connection with the preparation and filing of the
Secondary  Registration Statement, and the Shareholders shall be  obligated
to pay any underwriting commissions or discounts in  connection with the
Secondary Offering.   (d) The Buyer and the Shareholders shall enter into
customary  indemnification arrangements, pursuant to which the Buyer  shall
indemnify the Shareholders with respect to any  misstatements or omissions
made in the Secondary Registration  Statement relating to the Buyer;
provided, however, that the  Buyer will not be liable in any such case if and
to the extent  that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of 
or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue  statement or omission
or alleged omission so made in  connection with the business and financial
information  relating to the Company prior to the Closing.   (e) If the
Secondary Offering is not completed by March 30, 2001,  the Shareholders may
make one written request (which request  shall be made by Mr. Klimasewski on
behalf of the  Shareholders) to the Buyer to register, and the Buyer shall 
register, under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to a  Registration
Statement on Form F-4 or S-8 or any successor  thereto) (a "DEMAND
REGISTRATION") for any number of Buyer  Shares not subject to the lock-up as
set forth in Section  5.2(i) received by the Shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement  for the resale of such shares in an underwritten public  offering
led by an underwriter selected by the     - 39 -   Shareholders and
subject to the prior consent of the Buyer,  which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided  that the Buyer shall not be obligated to
effect (x) more than  one Demand Registration for the Shareholders or (y) a
Demand  Registration if the Shareholders propose to sell Buyer Shares  with
an aggregate price (based upon the average closing price  quoted on the
Nasdaq National Market for the five trading days  ending on the fifth day
prior to the date of such request) of  less than US$100,000,000 or not more
than US$300,000,000. If  at the time the Demand Registration is made pursuant
to this  Section 4.9(e), the Buyer is engaged in any bona fide proposal  for
a merger, acquisition or material financing which, in the  good faith
determination of the Board of Directors of the  Buyer, would be adversely
affected by the Demand Registration  to the material detriment of the Buyer,
then the Buyer may at  its option direct that such request be delayed for a 
reasonable period not in excess of 90 days from the date of  the written
request. The request for a Demand Registration by  the Shareholders shall
state the amount of the Buyer Shares  proposed to be sold and the lead
underwriter selected by the  Shareholders. The Buyer shall be obligated to
pay any expenses  incurred in connection with the Demand Registration and
the  Shareholders shall be obligated to pay any underwriting  commissions or
discounts in connection with the Demand  Registration. It being understood
that such sales by  Shareholders in Section 4.9 shall be made only to U.S. 
residents through the Nasdaq National Market.   (f) Without limiting or
otherwise restricting the rights granted  to the Shareholders pursuant to
this Section 4.9 or Section  6.3, if the Buyer proposes to register
(including for this  purpose a registration effected by the Buyer for
stockholders  other than the Shareholders) any of its stock or other 
securities under the Securities Act in connection with the  public offering
of such securities (other than a registration  relating solely to the sale of
securities to participants in a  Buyer employee benefit plan, or a
registration on any form  which does not include substantially the same
information as  would be required to be included in a registration
statement  covering the sale of the Buyer Shares), the Buyer shall,  within
five (5) days before the anticipated filing date, give  each Shareholder
written notice of such registration. Upon the  written request of any
Shareholder given within five (5) days  after the date of such notice by the
Buyer, the Buyer shall,  subject to the provisions of this Section, cause to
be  registered under the Securities Act all of the Buyer Shares  that each
such Shareholder has requested to be registered. The  failure of any
Shareholder to respond within such five-day  period shall be deemed to be a
waiver of such Shareholder\'s  rights under this Section 4.9(f), only with
respect to the  particular registration for which notice has been given. If
a  Shareholder sends the Buyer a written request for inclusion of  part or
all of such Shareholder\'s Buyer Shares in a  registration, such Shareholder
shall not be entitled to  withdraw or revoke such request without prior
written consent  of the Buyer in its sole discretion unless, as a result
of     - 40 -   facts or circumstances arising after the date on which
such  request was made relating to the Buyer or to market  conditions, such
Shareholder reasonably determines that  participation in such registration
would have a material  adverse effect on such Shareholder. In connection with
any  offering involving an underwriting of shares of the Buyer\'s  capital
stock, the Buyer shall not be required under this  Section 4.9(f) to include
any of the Buyer Shares in such  underwriting unless the Shareholders accept
the terms of the  underwriting as agreed upon between the Buyer and the 
underwriters selected by it (or by other persons entitled to  select the
underwriters). If the total amount of securities,  including Buyer Shares
requested by Shareholders to be  included in such offering, exceeds the
amount of securities  that the underwriters determine in their sole
discretion is  compatible with the success of the offering in view of the 
market conditions, then the Buyer shall be required to include  in the
offering only that number of such securities, including  Buyer Shares, which
the underwriters determine in their sole  discretion will not jeopardize the
success of the offering,  FIRST all of the securities to be offered for the
account of  the Buyer, SECOND, the securities to be offered for the  account
of the selling shareholders (including the selling  Shareholders), pro rata
based on the number of securities  owned by such shareholders and entitled to
inclusion therein  on the basis of a registration rights agreement with the 
Buyer; and THIRD, any other securities requested to be  included in such
offering. This Section 4.9(f) shall cease to  apply on June 1, 2002, subject
to the Buyer complying with  Sections 4.9 and 6.3.  4.10 OTHER ACTIONS  
No party shall take any action, except in every case as may be required  by
applicable law, that would or is intended to result in: (a) any of  its
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement that are 
qualified as to materiality being or becoming untrue; (b) any of such 
representations and warranties that are not so qualified becoming  untrue in
any manner having a Company Material Adverse Effect or Buyer  Material
Adverse Effect, as the case may be; (c) any of the conditions  set forth in
this Agreement not being satisfied or in a violation of  any provision of
this Agreement; or (d) adversely affecting the ability  of any of them to
obtain any of the consents or approvals required from  any Governmental
Entity as a condition to Closing.  4.11 TAX RETURN FILING.   (a) The
Shareholders shall cause the Company to prepare, in a  manner consistent with
past practices, and timely file  (including extensions of time to file) all
Tax Returns  required to be filed by the Company, the due date of which 
(without extensions) occurs on or before the date of the  Closing and pay (i)
all Taxes due with respect to any such Tax  Returns, and (ii) all other Taxes
due or claimed to be due  from or with respect to the Company on or before
the date of  the Closing; provided that the Shareholders shall     - 41
-   submit drafts of all such Tax Returns that are related to  Taxes based
on the income of the Company to Buyer no later  than 30 days prior to the due
date of such Tax Return, for  Buyer\'s review and comment.   (b) The
Company will prepare and timely file any Tax Returns due  to be filed by the
Company after the date of the Closing but  relating to periods of time prior
to the date of the Closing.   (c) The Buyer will, or will cause the Company
to prepare and  timely file all Tax Returns with respect to the Company
that  relate to the Straddle Period and are required to be filed  after the

necessary to  maintain the S status of the Company for federal purposes and 
for the purposes of each state listed in Schedule 2.12 as a  state in which
the Company is treated as an S corporation,  through the date that is one day
prior to Closing.   (e) The Shareholders will not cause the Company to make
any  additional federal tax elections under the Code with respect  to the
Company for any tax period ending after the date of the  Closing.  4.12
ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION   After the date of the Closing, each of the
Shareholders and Buyer shall  as may reasonably be requested:   (a) assist
(and, where appropriate, cause their respective  affiliates to assist) the
other party in preparing any Tax  Returns or reports which such other party
is responsible for  preparing and filing in accordance with Section 4.11;  
(b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes  with taxing
authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the  Company or the
Subsidiaries;   (c) make available to the other and to any taxing authority
to the  extent reasonably requested all information, records, and  documents
relating to Taxes of the Company or the  Subsidiaries;   (d) provide timely
notice to the other in writing of nay pending  or threatened tax audits or
assessments of the Company or the  Subsidiaries for any taxable period (or
portion thereto)  ending on or prior to the date of the Closing; and   (e)
furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received  from any taxing
authority in connection with any tax audit or  information requested with
respect to any such taxable period.     - 42 -   Any information
obtained under the provisions of this Section 4.12  shall be kept
confidential except as may otherwise be necessary in  connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in  conducting an audit or
other proceeding.  4.13 SUBCHAPTER S RELIEF.   In the event of an
inadvertent termination of the Company\'s S  corporation status prior to the
date of the Closing for federal or  state purposes, the Shareholders will use
their best efforts to obtain  relief with the appropriate taxing

trade or business outside  the United States (within the meaning of Treas.
Reg.  ss.1.367(a)-2T(b)(2) and (3)) for the entire 36-month period  ending
on the date of the Closing. Buyer has no intention to  substantially dispose
of or discontinue such trade or  business. For this representation, the
activities of any  qualified subsidiary of Buyer (as defined in Treas.

CONFIDENTIALITY   After the Closing, Buyer, Buyer Sub and each Shareholder
shall strictly  maintain the confidentiality of all information, documents
and  materials relating to the Company or the transactions contemplated by 
this Agreement, including without limitation the terms hereof, except  to the
extent disclosure of any such information is reasonably believed  by the
disclosing party to be required by law or authorized by the  other party, or
otherwise made publicly available by the other party,  or reasonably occurs
in connection with disputes over the terms of this  Agreement. In the event
that any party hereto reasonably believes after  consultation with counsel
that it is required by law to disclose any  confidential information
described in this Section 6.1, such disclosing  party will (a) provide the
other party with prompt notice before such  disclosure in order that the
other party may attempt to obtain a  protective order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be  accorded to confidential information, and (b)
cooperate with the other  party in attempting to obtain such order or
assurance. The provisions  of this Section 6.1 shall not apply to any
information, documents or  materials which are in the public domain or shall

disclosing party of this  Agreement or becomes known in the industry through
no wrongful act on  the part of such disclosing party.  6.2 COOPERATION

any matters, disputes, suits or claims by or against  any person not a party
to this Agreement and including the execution of  agreements with the
employees of the Surviving Company in accordance  with Buyer\'s current
employment policies and applicable law.  6.3 REGISTRATION OF BUYER
SHARES   (a) SHELF PROSPECTUS. The Buyer shall:   (i) as soon as
practicable after June 29, 2001, prepare  and file with the SEC a
registration statement on  Form F-3 or F-10 or any     - 49 -  
comparable registration form then in effect (the  "REGISTRATION STATEMENT")
relating to the resale of  the Buyer Shares by the Shareholders from time
to  time on the Nasdaq National Market or the facilities  of any U.S.
national securities exchange or market on  which the Buyer Shares (issued
pursuant to this  Agreement) are then traded or in privately-negotiated 
transactions in the United States;   (ii) use its reasonable efforts,
subject to receipt of  necessary information from the Shareholders, to
cause  the SEC to declare the Registration Statement  effective within 60
days after the Registration  Statement is filed by the Buyer;   (iii)
promptly prepare and file with the SEC (and provide  notice to the
Shareholders of any such filing) such  amendments and supplements to the
Registration  Statement and the prospectus used in connection  therewith as
may be necessary to keep the  Registration Statement effective until the
earlier of  (i) two years after the effective date of the  Registration
Statement, or (ii) the date on which the  Buyer Shares may be resold by the
Shareholders  without registration by reason of Rule 144(k) under  the
Securities Act or any other rule of similar  effect;   (iv) furnish to each
Shareholder with respect to the Buyer  Shares registered under the
Registration Statement  (and to each underwriter, if any, of such Buyer 
Shares) such number of copies of prospectuses and  such other documents as
the Shareholder may  reasonably request, in order to facilitate the public 
sale or other disposition of all or any of the Buyer  Shares by the
Shareholder;   (v) file documents required of the Buyer for normal "blue 
sky" clearance in states specified in writing by the  Shareholders; provided,
however, that the Buyer shall  not be required to qualify to do business or
consent  to service of process in any jurisdiction in which it  is not now
so qualified or has not so consented;   (vi) notify each holder of Buyer
Shares covered by such  Registration Statement at any time when a
prospectus  relating thereto is required to be delivered under  the
Securities Act of the happening of any event as a  result of which the
prospectus included in such  Registration Statement, as then in effect,
includes  an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to  state a
material fact required to be stated therein  or necessary to make the
statements therein not  misleading in the light of the circumstances then 
existing. The Buyer will use reasonable best efforts  to amend or supplement
such prospectus in order to  cause such prospectus not to include any
untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state a     - 50 -  
material fact required to be stated therein or  necessary to make the
statements therein not  misleading in the light of the circumstances then 
existing;   (vii) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish, on the  date
that such Buyer Shares are delivered to the  underwriters for sale, if such
securities are being  sold through underwriters selected by the Buyer, (i) 
an opinion, dated as of such date, of the counsel  representing the Buyer for
the purposes of such  registration, in form and substance as is customarily 
given to underwriters in an underwritten public  offering, addressed to the
underwriters, if any, and  (ii) a letter dated as of such date, from the 
independent certified public accountants of the  Buyer, in form and substance
as is customarily given  by independent certified public accountants to 
underwriters in an underwritten public offering  addressed to the
underwriters;   (viii) bear all expenses in connection with the procedures 
in paragraphs (i) through (ix) of this Section, and  the registration of the
Buyer Shares pursuant to the  Registration Statement, other than fees and
expenses,  if any, of counsel and other advisers to the  Shareholders or
underwriting discounts, brokerage  fees, Taxes payable and commissions
incurred by the  Shareholders, if any; and   (ix) in the event of any
underwritten public offering with  an underwriter selected by the Buyer,
enter into and  perform its obligations under an underwriting  agreement, in
usual and customary form, with the  managing underwriter(s) of such offering.
Each  Shareholder participating in such underwriting shall  also enter into
and perform its obligations under  such an agreement.   The Buyer
understands that the Shareholders disclaim being  underwriters, and that the
Shareholders being deemed an  underwriter shall not relieve the Buyer of any
obligations it  has hereunder.   (b) DISPOSITION. Notwithstanding the
generality of Section 6.3(a),  each Shareholder agrees that upon notice from
Buyer at any  time or from time to time during the time the prospectus 
relating to the securities proposed to be sold by such  Shareholder is
required to be delivered under the Securities  Act of the happening of any
event as a result of which, in  Buyer\'s opinion, the prospectus included in
the Registration  Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement
of  a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to  be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein  not misleading in light
of the circumstances then existing,  such Shareholder will forthwith
discontinue such Shareholder\'s  disposition of such securities pursuant to
the Registration  Statement until     - 51 -   the time of such
Shareholder\'s receipt of a supplement to or  an amendment of such prospectus
as may be necessary so that,  as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of
such securities,  such prospectus shall not include, in Buyer\'s opinion,
an  untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a  material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to  make the statements therein
not misleading in light of the  circumstances then existing. It is understood
and agreed that,  after the Registration Statement has been declared
effective,  its effectiveness may be suspended on or one more occasions  for
up to an aggregate of 90 days in a twelve-month period,  provided that no
single suspension of such effectiveness shall  be in effect for more than 30
consecutive days.   (c) PUBLIC INFORMATION. For so long as Buyer is subject
to the  reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act  and
any of the Buyer Shares are deemed "RESTRICTED SECURITIES"  under Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act, Buyer  will file the reports required
to be filed by it under the  Securities Act and Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act  and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, 
or, if it ceases to be so required to file such reports, it  will, upon the
request of the Shareholders (i) make publicly  available such information as
is necessary to permit sales of  Buyer Shares pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act,  and (ii) take such further action that is reasonable in
the  circumstances, in each case to the extent required from time  to time
to enable the Shareholders to sell their Buyer Shares  without registration
under the Securities Act within the  limitation of the exemptions provided by
Rule 144 under the  Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from time to
time,  or any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the 
SEC.   (d) LISTING. Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause 
the Buyer Shares to be sold pursuant to the Registration  Statement to be
listed on the Nasdaq National Market or any  other securities exchanges or
markets on which shares of Buyer  Subordinate Voting Shares are then
listed.   (e) INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.   (i) In the event of a
registration of any of the Buyer  Shares under the Securities Act pursuant to
this  Section 6.4, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless  each Shareholder
and each Shareholder Affiliate  against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities,  joint or several, to which such Shareholder or  Shareholder
Affiliate may become subject under the  Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or
any other  federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at  common law
or otherwise (including in settlement of  any litigation, if such settlement
is effected with  the written consent of the Buyer), insofar as such 
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in  respect thereof) arise
out of or are based upon any  untrue statement     - 52 -   or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact  contained in the Registration
Statement, including  the prospectus, financial statements and schedules, 
and all other documents filed as a part thereof, as  amended at the time of
effectiveness of the  Registration Statement, including any information 
deemed to be a part thereof as of the time of  effectiveness pursuant to
paragraph (b) of SEC Rule  430A, or pursuant to SEC Rule 434, or the
prospectus,  in the form first filed with the SEC pursuant to SEC  Rule
424(b), or filed as part of the Registration  Statement at the time of
effectiveness if no Rule  424(b) filing is required (the "PROSPECTUS"), or
any  amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or  are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to  state therein a material fact required to be
stated  therein or necessary to make the statements therein  not misleading,
and will reimburse each such  Shareholder and each such Shareholder Affiliate
for  any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by  such Shareholder or
Shareholder Affiliate in  connection with investigating, defending,
settling,  compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage,  liability
or action; provided, however, that Buyer  will not be liable in any such case
if and to the  extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability  arises
out of or is based upon an untrue statement or  alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged  omission so made in connection with the business 
financial information relating to the Company prior  to the Closing or so
made in conformity with  information furnished by such Shareholder 
specifically for use in such Registration Statement.  For purposes hereof,
the term "SHAREHOLDER AFFILIATE"  shall mean any affiliates of the
Shareholder and any  officer, director, trustee or other person who 
controls the Shareholder or any affiliate of the  Shareholder within the
meaning of Section 15 of the  Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act, and  the term "Registration Statement" shall include any  final
prospectus, exhibit, supplement or amendment  included in or relating to, and
any document  incorporated by reference in, the Registration  Statement.  
(ii) In the event of a registration of any of the Buyer  Shares under the
Securities Act pursuant to this  Section 6.4, each Shareholder having Buyer
Shares  registered thereunder, severally and not jointly,  will indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer and each Buyer  Affiliate, each underwriter and each
person who  controls any underwriter within the meaning of the  Securities
Act, against all losses, claims, damages  or liabilities, joint or several,
to which Buyer or  such Buyer Affiliate, underwriter or person may  become
subject under the Securities Act or otherwise,  insofar as such loses,
claims, damages or liabilities  (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of
or are  based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue  statement of any
material fact contained in the  Registration     - 53 -   Statement or
any amendment or supplement thereof, or  arise out of or are based upon the
omission or  alleged omission to state therein a material fact  required to
be stated therein or necessary to make  the statements therein not
misleading, and will  reimburse Buyer and each such officer, director, 
underwriter and controlling person for any legal or  other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in  connection with investigating or defending
any such  loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided,  however, that
such Shareholder will be liable under  the Section 6.3(e)(ii) in any such
case if and only  to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or 
liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue  statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material  fact or omission or alleged omission of a
material  fact made in reliance upon and in conformity with  information
pertaining to such Shareholder furnished  in writing to Buyer by such
Shareholder specifically  for use in the Registration Statement; and
provided  further, however, that the liability of each  Shareholder
hereunder shall not in any event exceed  the net proceeds received from the
sale of his, her  or its Buyer Shares covered by such Registration 
Statement.   (iii) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under 
this Section 6.3(e) of notice of the threat or  commencement of any action,
such indemnified party  will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made 
against an indemnifying party under this Section  6.3(e), promptly notify the
indemnifying party in  writing thereof; but the omission to so notify the 
indemnifying party will not relieve it from any  liability which it may have
to any indemnified party  for contribution or otherwise under the indemnity 
agreement contained in this Section 6.3(e) to the  extent it is not
prejudiced as a result of such  failure. In case any such action is brought
against  any indemnified party and such indemnified party  seeks or intends
to seek indemnity from an  indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will
be  entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that  it may wish,
jointly with all other indemnifying  parties similarly notified, to assume
the defense  thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such 
indemnified party; provided, however, if the  defendants in any such action
include both the  indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the 
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded  that there may be a
conflict between the positions of  the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party in  conducting the defense of any such action or that  there may be
legal defenses available to it and/or  other indemnified parties which are
different from or  additional to those available to the indemnifying  party,
the indemnified party or parties shall have  the right to select separate
counsel to assume such  legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the 
defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified  party or parties. Upon
receipt of notice from the     - 54 -   indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its  election so to assume the defense of such action
and  approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the  indemnifying party
will not be liable to such  indemnified party under this Section 6.3(e) for
any  legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such  indemnified
party in connection with the defense  thereof unless (1) the indemnified
party shall have  employed such counsel in connection with the  assumption
of legal defenses in accordance with the  proviso to the preceding sentence
(it being  understood, however, that the indemnifying party  shall not be
liable for the expenses of more than one  separate counsel, approved by such
indemnifying party  in the case of paragraph (i), representing all of the 
indemnified parties who are parties to such action)  or (2) the indemnified
party shall not have employed  counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnifying  party to represent the indemnified party within a  reasonable
time after notice of commencement of  action, in each of which cases the
reasonable fees  and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of  the
indemnifying party.   (iv) In order to provide for just and equitable 
contribution to joint liability under the Securities  Act in any case in
which either (1) any indemnified  party exercising rights under this
Agreement makes a  claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 
6.3(e) but it is judicially determined (by the entry  of a final judgment or
decree by a court of competent  jurisdiction and the expiration of time to
appeal or  the denial of the last right of appeal) that such 
indemnification may not be enforced in such case  notwithstanding the fact
that this Section 6.3(e)  provides for indemnification in such case, (2) 
contribution under the Securities Act may be required  on the part of any
such Shareholder in circumstances  for which indemnification is provided
under this  Section 6.3, or (3) the indemnification provided for  by this
Section 6.3 is insufficient to hold harmless  an indemnified party, other
than by reason of the  exceptions provided therein, then, and in each such 
case, Buyer and the Shareholders will contribute to  the aggregate losses,
claims, damages or liabilities  to which they may be subject (after
contribution from  others) (x) in such proportion as is appropriate to 
reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party  on the one hand and the
indemnified party on the  other or (y) if the allocation provided by clause
(x)  above is not permitted by applicable law, or provides  a lesser sum to
the indemnified party than the amount  hereinafter calculated, in such
proportion as is  appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault 
referred to in clause (x) above but also the relative  benefits received by
the indemnifying party and the  indemnified party from the registration of
the  securities as well as the statements or omissions  which resulted in
such losses, claims, damages or  liabilities and any other relevant
equitable     - 55 -   considerations. No Shareholder will be required
to  contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds  received from the
sale of his, her or its Buyer  Shares covered by such Registration Statement
and no  person or entity guilty of fraudulent  misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 12  of the Securities Act) will be entitled to 
contribution from any person or entity who was not  guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.   (v) The obligations of the Buyer and the Shareholders 
under this Section 6.3(e) shall survive completion of  any offering of Buyer
Shares pursuant to a  Registration Statement and the termination of
Buyer\'s  obligations under Section 6.3(a). No indemnifying  party, in the
defense of any such claim or  litigation, shall, except with the consent of
each  indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment  or enter into any
settlement which does not include  as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the  claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a  release
from all liability in respect to such claim  or litigation.   (f)
INFORMATION AVAILABLE. So long as the Registration Statement  is effective
covering the resale of Buyer Shares owned by the  Shareholders, the Buyer
will furnish to each Shareholder:   (i) as soon as practicable after (A) its
Annual Report on  Form 10-K, 20-F or 40-F, (B) its interim reports, (C)  its
material change reports, (D) its proxy statement,  (E) a full copy of the
particular Registration  Statement covering the Buyer Shares, and (F) a
copy  of each other registration statement covering Buyer  Subordinate
Voting Shares filed with the SEC (the  foregoing, in each case, excluding
exhibits unless  requested by such Shareholder); and   (ii) a reasonable
number of copies of the prospectuses to  supply to any other party requiring
such  prospectuses; and the Buyer, upon the reasonable  request of the
Shareholder, will meet with the  Shareholder or a representative thereof at
the  Buyer\'s headquarters to discuss information relevant  for disclosure
in the Registration Statement covering  the Buyer Shares and will otherwise
cooperate with  any Shareholder conducting an investigation for the  purpose
of reducing or eliminating such Shareholder\'s  exposure to liability under
the Securities Act,  including the reasonable production of information at 
the Buyer\'s headquarters, subject to appropriate  confidentiality
limitations.  6.4 REORGANIZATION   From and after the date hereof and
until the Effective Time, no party  hereto, nor, in the case of the corporate
entities, any of their  respective subsidiaries or other     - 56 -  
affiliates shall knowingly take any action, or knowingly fail to take  any
action, that would jeopardize qualification of the Merger as a 
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) and  368(a)(2)(E)
of the Code. Each of Buyer, the Company, the Surviving  Corporation and the
Shareholders shall file all federal and state  income tax returns consistent
with the treatment of the Merger as a  Reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1)(A) and  368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.  6.5 EXPENSES  
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each party hereto will  pay
its own expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of  this
Agreement, the performance of their respective obligations  hereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,  whether or not
consummated.  6.6 NON-COMPETITION   The Shareholders shall not, for a
period of three years from the  Effective Time ("NON-COMPETE PERIOD"), within
Canada, the United States  and the European Union and in any country in which
the Buyer or the  Company presently conducts or may conduct business in the
future,  without the prior written consent of the Buyer, directly or
indirectly,  in any manner whatsoever, including, without limitation,
either  individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with
any  other person, as principal, agent, shareholder or in any other manner 
whatsoever, carry on or be engaged in or be concerned with or lend  money to,

defend, indemnify and hold harmless all of the Buyer  Indemnified Persons
against any and all Claims incurred or suffered by  or imposed upon any of

required to be  entered into by any of the Shareholders or the Company 
pursuant hereto to the extent not waived in writing by the  Buyer.   The
obligation of indemnification of the Shareholders hereunder shall  be joint
and several.   For the purpose of this indemnification all representations
and  warranties shall be read without giving effect to any qualification as 
to materiality.  7.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE BUYER.   The Buyer shall be
liable to each of the Shareholders and their  respective heirs and assigns
(collectively the "SHAREHOLDERS  INDEMNIFIED PERSONS" and each a
"SHAREHOLDERS INDEMNIFIED PERSON") and  shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless all of the Shareholders  Indemnified Persons against any and all
Claims incurred or suffered by  or imposed upon any of the Shareholders

obligation of  the Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any agreement or

extent not waived in writing by the  Shareholders;   provided that the
amount of indemnification in relation to such Claims  to be made by the
Shareholder Indemnified Person pursuant to the  provisions hereof shall be
limited to a fraction of the total Claims  resulting from the applicable
breach determined by dividing the number  of Buyer Subordinate Voting Shares
of the share capital of the Buyer  held by such Shareholder immediately after
the     - 58 -   Effective Time divided by the total number of Buyer
Shares issued  pursuant to this Agreement.  7.4 INDEMNIFICATION AGAINST
THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.   (a) Promptly upon receipt by any of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons  or the Shareholder Indemnified Persons (in this
Section  referred to as the "INDEMNITEE") of a notice of any Third  Party
Claim in respect of which the Indemnitee proposes to  demand indemnification
from the Buyer or the Shareholder (in  this Section referred to as the
"INDEMNITOR") pursuant to the  provisions hereof, the Indemnitee shall give
written notice to  that effect to the Indemnitor with reasonable
promptness.   (b) The Indemnitor shall have the right by written notice to
the  Indemnitee not later than 30 days after giving of the notice  described
in Section 7.4 to assume the control of the defence,  compromise or
settlement of the Third Party Claim, provided  that such assumption shall, by
its terms, be without cost to  the Indemnitee and shall not limit in any way
the Indemnitee\'s  right to indemnification pursuant to the provisions
hereof.   (c) Upon the assumption of control by the Indemnitor as
aforesaid,  the Indemnitor shall, at its expense, diligently proceed with 
the defence, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim  at
Indemnitor\'s sole expense, including retention of counsel  reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee and, in connection  therewith, the Indemnitee
shall co-operate fully, but at the  sole expense of the Indemnitor, to make
available to the  Indemnitor all pertinent information and witnesses under
the  Indemnitee\'s control, make such assignments and take such  other steps
as in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnitor  are necessary to enable the
Indemnitor to conduct such  defence, provided always that the Indemnitee
shall be entitled  to reasonable security from the Indemnitor for any
expense,  costs or other liabilities to which it may be or may become 
exposed by reason of such co-operation.   (d) The final determination of any
such Third Party Claim,  including all related costs, attorneys\' fees and
expenses,  shall be binding and conclusive upon the Indemnitor and the 
Indemnitee as to the validity or invalidity, as the case may  be, of such
Third Party Claim against the Indemnitor  hereunder.   Notwithstanding any
provision of this Section 7.4, the Indemnitor may  not consent to any
settlement of a Third Party Claim if the terms of  such settlement require
the Indemnitee to act or refrain from acting,  without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitee.   (e) Should the Indemnitor fail to give notice
to the Indemnitee as  provided in Section 7.4, the Indemnitee shall be
entitled to  make such settlement of the     - 59 -   Third Party Claim
as in its sole discretion may appear  advisable, and such settlement or any
other final  determination of the Third Party Claim shall be binding upon 
the Indemnitor.  7.5 TAX INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) The Shareholders agree,
jointly and severally, to indemnify  and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Parties against any  Losses incurred or paid by a Buyer Indemnified Party,
which  arise as a result of (i) any liability for any Taxes imposed  on the
Company and the Subsidiaries pursuant to federal,  state, local or foreign
law attributable to any periods ending  on or before the date of the Closing,
(ii) with respect to any  Straddle Period, the portion of Taxes payable by or
assessed  against the Company which are properly allocable to the part  of

7.5(b), (iii) any breach of the  representations or warranties made by the
Company and the  Shareholders in Section 2.12, and (iv) any breach of, or 
failure to perform, any agreement or covenant contained in  Sections 4.11,

this Agreement, whether  under this Section 7.5 or otherwise, shall be
treated by the  Buyer and the Shareholders as purchase price adjustments

Agreement.   (b) For purposes of this Section 7.5, with respect to any
taxable  year or period beginning before and ending after the date of  the
Closing (a "STRADDLE PERIOD"), an allocation of Taxes  shall be made to the
part of such Straddle Period which ends  on the date of the Closing based on
(i) the closing of the  books method, in the case of income or any similar
Taxes, (ii)  the number of days elapsed between the beginning of such 
Straddle Period to and including the date of the Closing in  the case of
property Taxes, and (iii) when the relevant  transaction occurs, in the case

savings and recoveries from third parties.  7.7 EXPIRY AND LIMITS OF

set forth in     - 60 -   Section 7.7(b)), shall terminate on the date

and;   (ii) 30% of the Merger Consideration, in the event of a  Claim

this  Agreement.   (d) Any claims for which the Shareholders shall become
liable  shall be payable to the Buyer from the Escrow Fund on a dollar  for

no event more than 15 days) after receipt by a Buyer  Indemnified Party or a
Shareholder Indemnified Party (an "INDEMNIFIED  PARTY") (as the case may
require) of notice of the commencement of any  action, such Indemnified Party
shall, if a claim in respect thereof is  to be made against the indemnifying
party under this Section 7.8,  notify in writing the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof.  In case any such action is brought against any
Indemnified Party, and  such Indemnified Party notifies the indemnifying
party of the  commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled
to  participate in and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any 
other     - 62 -   indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the
defense thereof,  subject to the provisions hereof, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory  to such Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, in the case of Tax Claims,
that  the Shareholders have acknowledged to the Buyer in writing the 
Shareholders\' liability under Section 7.5 for all Tax Losses incurred  or
suffered by the Buyer or the Company which results from such action. 
Following notification to the Indemnified Party of its election so to  assume
the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable  to such
Indemnified Party under this Section 7.8 for any legal or other  expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection  with the
defense there, other than reasonable costs of investigation.  The Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel  in any such action and
to participate in the defense thereof, but the  fees and expenses of such
counsel shall not be at the expense of the  indemnifying party if the
indemnifying party has assumed the defense of  the action, within a
reasonable time after notice of commencement of  the action, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified  Party; PROVIDED HOWEVER, that the
indemnifying party shall be required  to pay for Indemnified Party\'s
counsel, if, such Indemnified Party  shall have reasonably concluded, on
reliance of the written opinion of  counsel experienced in such matters, that
there may be defenses  available to it or him which are different from or
additional to those  available to the indemnifying party (in which case
indemnifying parties  shall not have the right to direct the defense of
action). The Buyer  shall also have the right to jointly control, with the
Shareholders,  any contest involving a Tax Losses with respect to Straddle
Periods. No  settlement of any action against an Indemnified Party shall be
made  without the consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld. In the event that any Indemnified Party should  have a
direct claim against any indemnifying party hereunder that does  not involve
any third-party claim or claims asserted against the  Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall transmit to the  indemnifying party a written notice
describing in reasonable detail the  nature of the claim, an estimate of the
amount of damages attributable  to such claim to the extent feasible (which
estimate shall not be  conclusive of the final amount of such claim) and the
basis of the  Indemnified Party\'s request for indemnification under this
ARTICLE 7.  If the indemnifying party does not notify the Indemnified Party
within  90 days from its receipt of such notice that the indemnifying party 
disputes such claim, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party in  the
indemnity notice shall be deemed a liability of the indemnifying  party
hereunder. If the indemnifying party has timely disputed such  claim, as
provided above, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation  in an
appropriate court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree  that the sole
and exclusive remedy which any party hereto shall have  against any other
party hereto under this Agreement shall be the right  to proceed for
indemnification in the manner and only to the extent  provided in this
ARTICLE 7.     - 63 -   ARTICLE 8   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND
WAIVER  8.1 TERMINATION   This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing  (except as limited as to time in Section 8.1(b)
below):   (a) by the mutual written consent of the Buyer and the 
Shareholders;   (b) by the Buyer or the Shareholders, if the Closing shall
not  have occurred prior to the 90th day following the date hereof; 
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement  under this
Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any party  if such party\'s failure
to fulfill any obligation under this  Agreement shall have been the cause of,
or shall have resulted  in, the failure of the Closing to occur prior to such
date;   (c) by the Buyer in the event a condition set forth in Sections 
5.1 or 5.2 becomes incapable of being fulfilled; or   (d) by the Buyer in
the event that a Disclosure Schedule is  amended or supplemented by the
Company, which amendment or  supplement is considered by the Buyer to have a
Company  Material Adverse Effect.  8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION   In the
event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in  Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall  be no liability on the
part of any party hereto; provided, however,  that nothing herein shall
relieve either the Shareholders or the Buyer  from liability for any breach
of this Agreement or failure to perform  hereunder. If this Agreement is
terminated as provided herein, upon  request therefore, each party will re-
deliver all documents, workpapers  and other material of any other party
relating to the transactions  contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or
after the execution  hereof, to the party furnishing the same.  8.3
WAIVER   At any time prior to Closing, any party may (a) extend the time for
the  performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party 
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and  warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant  hereto or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions  contained herein. Any

other parties hereto or a final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.   Section 6.4 DISAGREEMENTS. In the event of any
disagreement between the other parties hereto resulting in adverse claims or

the Escrow Agent shall have received (i) a final non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction directing delivery of the Escrow Fund or (ii)

delivery of the Escrow Fund, in which event the Escrow Agent shall disburse
the Escrow Fund in accordance with such order or agreement. Any court order

satisfactory to the Escrow Agent to the effect that the order is final and
non-appealable. The Escrow Agent shall act on such court order and legal
opinion without further question.   Section 6.5 FEES. The Buyer shall pay
the Escrow Agent compensation, as payment in full for the services to be
rendered by the Escrow Agent hereunder, in the amounts set forth on Schedule

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT   This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") dated as
of _________, 2000 is entered into by and between Burleigh Instruments, Inc.,
a corporation having its principal place of business at 7647 Main Street,
Fishers, New York, U.S.A. (the "Corporation") and [name](the
"Employee").     TERMS OF AGREEMENT  ------------------   In
consideration of this Agreement and the continued employment of the
Employee by the Corporation, the parties agree as follows :   1.
EMPLOYMENT   The Corporation hereby agrees to employ Employee, on a full-
time basis  commencing on or about _________, 2000, to act as [title] of
the  Corporation and to perform such acts and duties and furnish such 
services to the Corporation in connection with and related to that  position
as is customary for persons with similar positions in like  companies, as the
[title] shall from time to time reasonably direct.  Employee hereby accepts
said employment. Employee shall use his best  and most diligent efforts to
promote the interests of the Corporation;  shall discharge his duties in a
highly competent manner; and shall  devote his full business time and his
best business judgement, skill  and knowledge to the performance of his
duties and responsibilities  hereunder. This Agreement shall not be
interpreted to prohibit Employee  from making passive personal investments or
conducting private business  affairs if such activities do not materially
interfere with the  services required under this Agreement. Employee shall
report to the  [title] of the Corporation.   2. COMPENSATION AND
BENEFITS   2.1 SALARY   During the term of this Agreement, the Corporation
shall pay  Employee the remuneration indicated in Schedule A. The 
Employee\'s remuneration may be adjusted upwards in accordance  with the
Corporation\'s policies and procedures.   2.2 DISCRETIONARY BONUS   During
the term of this Agreement, the Employee may  participate in such bonus plan
or plans of the Corporation as  the Board of Directors of the Corporation may
approve for the  Employee. Nothing contained in this Section 2.2 shall be 
construed to require   - 1 -     the Board of Directors to approve a
bonus plan or in any way  grant to Employee the right to receive bonuses not
otherwise  approved.   2.3 BENEFITS   During the term of this Agreement,
the Employee shall receive  such benefits as customarily provided to other
officers and  employees of the Corporation. Details of such benefits as of 
the date hereof are set forth in Schedule B of this Agreement.   2.4
VACATION   Employee may take paid vacation during each year as set forth 
in Schedule A at such times as shall be consistent with the  Corporation\'s
vacation policies and (in the Corporation\'s  judgement) with the
Corporation\'s vacation schedule for  officers and other employees.   2.5
EXPENSES   Pursuant to the Corporation\'s customary policies in force at 
the time of payment, Employee shall be promptly reimbursed,  against
presentation of vouchers or receipts therefor, for all  authorised expenses
properly incurred by him on the  Corporation\'s behalf in the performance of
his duties  hereunder.  3. TERMINATION   3.1 UNDERTAKING BY EMPLOYEE  
The Employee hereby undertakes not to voluntarily terminate  his employment
with the Corporation for a period of two (2)  years from the date hereof and
acknowledges that in the event  that he does so terminate this Agreement,
certain penalties  shall be payable by him, as set forth in the Agreement
of  Merger and Plan of Reorganization, entered into by the  Employee, the
Corporation and certain other parties on [date].   3.2 DISABILITY   If
during the term of this Agreement, Employee becomes ill,  disabled or
otherwise incapacitated so as to be unable to  perform his usual duties (a)
for a period in excess of one  hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days, or
(b) for more  than one hundred eighty (180) days in any consecutive twelve 
(12) month period and this incapacity has not been remedied by  the end of
the twelfth (12th) month of such consecutive twelve  (12) month period, then
the Corporation shall have the right  to terminate this Agreement, subject
only to applicable laws,  on thirty (30) day\'s notice to Employee.
Termination pursuant  to this Section 3.1 shall not affect any rights
Employee may  otherwise have under any disability insurance policies in 
effect at the time of such termination.   - 2 -    3.3 DISCHARGE FOR
CAUSE   The Corporation may discharge Employee and terminate his 
employment under this Agreement for cause without further  liability to the
Corporation by a majority vote of the Board  of Directors of the Corporation
except that the Employee, if a  Director, shall not be entitled to vote
thereon. As used in  this Section 3.2, "cause" shall mean any or all of the 
following;   (a) gross or wilful misconduct of Employee during the  course
of his employment;   (b) conviction of any criminal offence involving 
dishonesty, breach of trust or moral turpitude during  the term of this
Agreement; or   (c) Employee\'s breach of any of the material terms of 
this Agreement.   3.4 TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE   Upon thirty (30) days
prior written notice, the Corporation  may terminate this Agreement without
cause by a majority vote  of the Board of Directors of the Corporation except
that the  Employee, if a Director, shall not be entitled to vote  thereon.
The Corporation shall incur no liability in this  regard except that it shall
continue to pay Employee the  remuneration set forth in Schedule A at his
then current rate  for a six (6) month period after termination if
termination  shall occur prior to the events mentioned in Section 3.4.  
3.5 TERMINATION FOLLOWING MERGER OR ACQUISITION   Notwithstanding Section
3.4, if the Corporation merges or  consolidates with another corporation, if
substantially all of  the assets of the Corporation are sold, if a majority
of the  outstanding stock of the Corporation is acquired by another  person,
or if the control of the Corporation\'s majority  shareholder changes (a
"Triggering Event") and Employee\'s  employment is subsequently terminated by
the Corporation or  surviving entity other than for cause as described in
3.2,  Employee shall be entitled to severance benefits as described  below
based on the length of service with the Corporation  since the Triggering
Event:   LENGTH OF SERVICE SINCE THE SEVERANCE BENEFITS 
--------------------------- ------------------  TRIGGERING EVENT 
----------------  0 to 12 months 12 months\' remuneration  plus health
benefits;  more than 12 months 6 months\' remuneration  plus health
benefits;   For purposes of this Section 3.5, Employee shall be entitled 
to treat a material demotion in title or function as  termination under this
Section 3.5, but only if Employee  expressly so notifies the Corporation and
terminates his  employment hereunder within thirty (30) days of such
demotion  or relocation. If Employee is offered a substantially similar 
position with the surviving entity, Employee\'s refusal   - 3 -    to
accept such position shall not be treated as subject to  this Section 3.5,
but rather shall be treated as a voluntary  termination by Employee under
Section 3.6.   3.6 VOLUNTARY TERMINATION BY EMPLOYEE   In the event of
voluntary termination by Employee after a  period of two (2) years from the
date hereof, Employee shall  be entitled only to those amounts that have
accrued to the  date of termination in accordance with the terms hereof or
are  expressly payable under the terms of the Corporation\'s  applicable
benefit plans or are required by applicable law.  The Corporation may, in its
sole and absolute discretion,  confer such other benefits or payments as it
determines, but  Employee shall have no entitlement thereto   4.
MISCELLANEOUS   4.1 INSURANCE   The Corporation hereby represents that it
is presently the  holder of directors and officers insurance in an amount
and  having a coverage that is recommended by its legal advisors  and
insurance broker as adequate taking into account the  status of the
Corporation, its size and the nature of its  activities. The Corporation
undertakes to ensure that such  insurance shall remain in force throughout
the term of this  Agreement and in the event such insurance is cancelled,
the  Corporation shall immediately advise the Employee in writing.   4.2
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   Upon execution of this Agreement, the Employee shall
execute  and deliver to the Corporation, unless previously delivered,  an
Exclusivity, Confidentiality, Assignment of Work Product,  Non-Competition
and Non-Solicitation Agreement.   4.3 NOTICES   Any notice or
communication given by any party hereto to the  other party shall be in
writing and personally delivered or  mailed by certified mail, return receipt

the others, such other address to which notices  to such person shall
thereafter be sent.   4.4 ENTIRE AGREEMENT   This Agreement contains the
entire understanding of the  parties in respect of its subject matter and
supersedes all  prior agreements and understandings between the parties
with  respect to such subject matter, provided, however that nothing  in
this Agreement shall affect the Employee\'s obligations  under the
Exclusivity,   - 4 -     Confidentiality, Assignment Of Work Product,
Non-Competition  And Non-Solicitation Agreement signed by the Employee.
