RECITALS

---|--- 
 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and of other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES_

 

 _1.01_ _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. Pursuant to the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, at the Closing, Seller shall sell,
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase,
acquire and accept from Seller, all of Sellers right, title and interest in
and to the Shares free and clear of all Liens (other than restrictions on
transfer generally arising pursuant to applicable securities laws). The
purchase price to be paid at the Closing by Buyer to Seller for the Shares
shall be an amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, and shall be subject
to adjustment as provided herein.

_1.02_ _Closing Payment Certificate; Debt Payoff Letters;
Transaction Expense Payoff Instructions_.

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Buyer a certificate (the " _Closing Payment

good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital Amount (such estimate is
referred to as the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ "), (iii) its good
faith estimate of Closing Indebtedness (such estimate is referred to as the "
_Estimated Closing_ _Indebtedness_ "), (iv) its calculation of the Estimated
Purchase Price and (v) wire instructions for the accounts designated by Seller
to which funds are to be wired at the Closing pursuant to  _Sections_ _
1.03(b)(_ _i_ _)_ and _1.03(b)(iv)_ , in each case together with reasonable
supporting information used by the Company in the preparation of such
estimates, which calculations shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and,
where applicable, the Accounting Practices and Procedures, provided, that to
the extent there is any inconsistency between such GAAP methodology and the
Accounting Practices and Procedures, the GAAP methodology shall supersede and
be the basis on which such amounts are calculated. After delivery of the
Closing Payment Certificate, Buyer and its accountants shall be permitted
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice to review the Companys financial and other relevant books and records
and any work papers (including any work papers of their respective
accountants) related to the preparation of the Closing Payment Certificate.
Buyer and its accountants may make reasonable inquiries



   

of Seller, the Company and their respective accountants and applicable
employees regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Closing

efforts to cause any such accountants and employees during normal business
hours to reasonably cooperate with and respond to such reasonable inquiries as
promptly as practicable. Buyer shall be entitled to submit comments to the
Closing Payment Certificate to the Company. The Company shall consider in
good faith modifying the Closing Payment Certificate to address any such
comments and shall revise the Closing Payment Certificate prior to the Closing
to reflect such comments if the Company determines in good faith to modify
the Closing Payment Certificate to account for Buyers comments thereto. No
comment delivered by Buyer, or Buyers failure to deliver any comments, shall
be deemed to constitute any waiver or release of any of Buyers rights under
this Agreement, including under _Section_ __ _ 1.04_.

(b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer (i) copies of payoff letters, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, with respect to all Estimated Closing
Indebtedness (not including Sellers parent company debt that the Company has
guaranteed), and the payment of all amounts payable under such payoff letters
shall discharge fully the then outstanding balance, including all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and any other fees, costs and expenses payable to
the holders in connection therewith, of such obligations, and (ii) copies of
releases, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, of all Liens
and other security over the Shares and the Companys and its
Subsidiaries properties and assets securing all such obligations.

(c) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer documentation, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, setting forth an itemized list and amounts of all
Transaction Expenses, including the identity of each payee, amounts owed,
wire instructions and any other information necessary to effect the final
payment in full thereof, and copies of final invoices for all services
rendered to the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Transaction

 _1.04_ _Calculation of_ _Final Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Determination_. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer
will deliver to Seller a reasonably detailed statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers calculations of Cash on Hand, the Net
Working Capital Amount and Closing Indebtedness. Solely in connection with the
preparation of the Closing Statement, Buyer agrees that it shall not, and
shall cause the Company not to, take any actions with respect to the
accounting books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries on which the
Closing Statement is to be based that are not consistent with GAAP. After
delivery of the Closing Statement, Seller and its accountants shall be
permitted reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice to review the Companys financial and other relevant books and
records and any work papers (including any work papers of their respective
accountants) related to the preparation of the Closing Statement. Seller and
its accountants may make reasonable inquiries of Buyer, the Company and their
respective accountants and applicable employees regarding questions
concerning or

 



4

    

 disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course of their
review thereof, and Buyer shall use its, and shall cause the Company to use
its, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants and
employees during normal business hours to reasonably cooperate with and
respond to such reasonable inquiries as promptly as practicable. If Seller has
any objections to the Closing Statement as a result of Buyers calculations
or the components thereof not being in accordance with this Agreement or as
having computational errors, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written statement
setting forth in reasonable detail the items in dispute, the amount thereof
in dispute and the basis for its objections thereto (an " _Objections
Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to Buyer within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing
Statement shall be final, binding, indisputable and non-appealable by the
parties hereto. Any component of the Closing Statement not covered by the
Objection Statement shall be final, binding, indisputable and non-appealable
by the parties. Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
objections set forth in the Objections Statement (and all such discussions
related thereto shall, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, be
governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and any applicable
similar state rule)), but if they do not reach a final resolution within
thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objections Statement (or if either
party ceases to act in good faith during such thirty (30) day period), Seller
and Buyer shall submit such dispute to Deloitte or, if Deloitte is not
available or refuses to act as independent accountant, another independent
nationally recognized accounting firm of similar standing mutually acceptable
to Buyer and Seller (the " _Accounting Referee_ "). Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate in good faith to promptly engage the Accounting Referee pursuant to
an engagement letter that requires the Accounting Referee to make all
determinations in accordance with GAAP and, where applicable, the Accounting
Practices and Procedures; _provided_ , _however_ that if the Accounting
Referee determines that the Accounting Practices and Procedures are not in
compliance with GAAP, then the GAAP methodology shall supersede and be the
basis on which each component of the Objections Statement is calculated. If
any dispute is submitted to the Accounting Referee, each party will promptly
upon request, furnish to the Accounting Referee such work papers and other
documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Accounting
Referee may reasonably request and are available to that party or
its accountants (including information of the Company) and otherwise
cooperate fully with the Accounting Referees review of the dispute, and each
party shall be afforded the opportunity to present the Accounting Referee
(with a copy concurrently delivered to the other party) material relating to
the determination and to discuss the determination with the Accounting
Referee. The Accounting Referee shall resolve only those matters set forth in
such Objections Statement that remain in dispute after the 30-day resolution
period. With respect to any disputed item, the Accounting Referee shall only
be permitted to select as a resolution the position of either Buyer or Seller.
It is the intent of Buyer, Seller and the Company that the process set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 1.04_ and the activities of the Accounting Referee in
connection herewith are not intended to be and, in fact, are not arbitration
and that no formal arbitration rules shall be followed (including rules with
respect to procedures and discovery). Seller and Buyer shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Referee to resolve all
such disagreements as soon as practicable but in no event later than thirty
(30) days after submission of the disputed issues to the Accounting Referee.
The resolution of the dispute by the Accounting Referee shall be final,
binding, indisputable and non-appealable on the parties hereto. The Closing
Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect such determination. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be allocated to be paid by
Buyer, on the one hand, and/or Seller, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the aggregate contested amount not awarded to
each party bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by such party, as
determined by the Accounting Referee. For example, if Buyer claims that the
Net Working Capital Amount is $10,000 less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount determined by the Company, and Seller contests only $5,000 of
the amount claimed by Buyer, and if the Accounting Referee ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding Buyer $3,000 of the $5,000 contested, then
the cost of such review and report will be allocated 60% (i.e., 3,000 ÷ 5,000)
to Seller and 40% (i.e., 2,000 ÷ 5,000) to Buyer.

(b) _Adjustments_.

 

(i) _Cash_ _On_ _Hand Adjustment_. If the Cash on Hand as finally
determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.04(a)_ above is greater than the
Estimated Cash on Hand, such excess shall result in an increase in the
Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.04(c)_. If the
Cash on Hand as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.04(a)_ above
is less than the Estimated Cash on Hand, such shortfall shall result in a
decrease in the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
1.04(c)_.

(ii) _Net Working Capital Adjustment_. If the Net Working Capital Amount
as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.04(a)_ above is greater
than the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, such excess shall result in an
increase in the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
1.04(c)_. If the Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.04(a)_ above is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital
Amount, such shortfall shall result in a decrease in the Estimated Purchase
Price in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.04(c)_.

 

(iii) _Closing Indebtedness Adjustment_. If the Closing Indebtedness as
finally determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.04(a)_ above is less than
the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, such shortfall shall result in an increase
in the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.04(c)_.
If the Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.04(a)_ above is greater than the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, such excess
shall result in a decrease in the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance

34

    

(c) Except to the extent explicitly set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
6.05_, and provided that Buyer shall consult with Seller in good faith, it is
understood and agreed that Buyer shall have the right to direct strategy with
respect to all matters set forth under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_. Subject
to the foregoing, all filings, applications, notices, analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, submissions, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party before any
Governmental Authority in connection with the approval of the contemplated
transactions shall be reviewed by outside counsel for the Buyer and Seller, it
being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any such filing, application, notice, analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, submission, brief, argument, opinion and proposal; _provided_
_that_  (i) nothing will prevent a party from responding to or complying with
a subpoena or other legal process required by Legal Requirement or submitting
information in response to a request therefore and (ii) each partys outside
counsel may, as it deems advisable and necessary, redact any material
provided to any other party under this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ that it

discussions with any Governmental Authority with respect thereto without
consulting with and offering outside counsel for the other party a meaningful
opportunity to participate in such meetings or discussions to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority.

 

(d) In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer and Seller agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to permit and cause the Closing to occur,
notwithstanding any requirement, request (including any request for additional
information or documentary material issued by a Government Authority under the
HSR Act) or condition sought or imposed by the FTC, the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental
Authority acting under the HSR Act, in each case, relating in any way to this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby ("
_Government Conditions_ "), where the failure to satisfy any Government
Condition would delay, prevent or make illegal such timely consummation of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however,
that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall not
be required to, and neither Seller nor the Company shall without the prior
written consent of Buyer, (i) comply with requests or undertakings to divest
or hold separate any of the assets or businesses of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its existing assets or businesses, (ii) comply with
other limitations or other requirements of the FTC, DOJ or other Governmental
Authority with respect to the operation of any of Buyers existing assets or

(e) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and
Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in obtaining, any consents

subject to the preceding subsections of this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_) in
connection with the execution and delivery of, and the performance of the
obligations pursuant to, this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining such consents from
other Persons, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to make
payments, commence litigation or agree to modifications of the terms and
conditions of any agreements with such other Persons. Except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, such consents shall not constitute
a condition to the Closing for purposes of this Agreement.

 



35

    

6.06 _Exclusivity_. Until the earlier of the Closing Date and the date
that this Agreement is terminated by its terms, Seller and the Company will
not, and they shall cause their Affiliates and direct their representatives
not to, directly or indirectly, take or permit any other Person on its behalf
to take any action to encourage, solicit, facilitate, initiate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, or enter into
any Contract regarding, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
merger involving the Company or its Subsidiaries, the sale of all or any
portion of the Companys or its Subsidiaries capital stock or other equity
interests or the sale of all or a material portion of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries assets, or similar transaction (an " _Acquisition Proposal_ ")
with any Person other than Buyer, its Affiliates and its or their
representatives. Seller and the Company previously ceased, and previously
caused their Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, employees,
representatives and Affiliates to cease, and caused to be terminated any
existing activities, including discussions or negotiations with any Person,
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and requested
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished in connection therewith. Seller and the Company shall, and Seller
shall cause its respective Affiliates and direct its Representatives to,

Proposal, (ii) __ any request for information or access to the Companys
properties, books or records that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) __ any inquiry with respect to, or which would

inquiry.

 

 _6.07_ _Supplement to Disclosure Schedule_. From time to time between
the date of this Agreement and the date that is five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules contained in _Article IV_
with respect to any matter first arising subsequent to the date of this
Agreement in the Ordinary Course of Business and in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 6.01_ (each a " _Schedule Supplement_ "), and each such Schedule
Supplement shall be deemed to be incorporated into and to supplement and
amend the Disclosure Schedules as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
in the event such event, development or occurrence which is the subject of the
Schedule Supplement, taken together with the matters that are included in all
other Schedule Supplements, (a) constitutes or relates to something that has
had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect or (b) would
otherwise give Buyer the right to not consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as a result of the failure of the condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ to be satisfied on the basis of such events,
developments or occurrences so disclosed, Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement; provided, further, that if Buyer has the right to,
but does not elect to, terminate this Agreement within fifteen (15) Business
Days of its receipt of such Schedule Supplement, then the Buyer shall
be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement
with respect to such Schedule Supplement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Seller may not deliver a Schedule Supplement in respect of any Disclosure
Schedule relating to a Company Fundamental Representation, Seller Fundamental
Representation or SOL Representation.

 

 _6.08_ _Transfer of Licenses_. From the date hereof through the Closing,
the parties shall reasonably cooperate in a review of all Licenses currently
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise materially
necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and to execute documents or take other reasonable steps to
ensure the continuation of such Licenses in the name of the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, the transfer of such Licenses to Buyer or the

of its Subsidiaries or Buyer, as applicable, so that the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Buyer will have all Licenses materially necessary for the
operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
following the Closing.

ARTICLE VII

 

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 

 _7.01_ _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
Company to honor the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under
any and all (i) indemnification agreements in effect as of the date hereof,
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and each
present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_"), set forth in _Schedule 7.01(a)_ and (ii)
indemnification and exculpation provisions in any certificate of incorporation
or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement, to the fullest extent
permitted under Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)_ shall require the Company to indemnify any DandO
Indemnified Person if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would not have
been obligated to indemnify such DandO Indemnified Person prior to Closing.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or
modify any provision in the Companys or its Subsidiaries articles or
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or other organizational documents)
relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any officers and directors
(unless required by Legal Requirements) in a manner inconsistent with this
_Section_ __ _ 7.01_ or otherwise adverse to the DandO Indemnified Persons, it
being the intent of the parties that the officers and directors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation
and indemnification to the full extent of the law.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase, and Seller shall pay
the entire cost of, a directors and officers liability insurance "tail" or
"runoff" insurance program (the " _Tail Policy_ ") to be in effect until the
end of the six-year period commencing as of the Closing Date (and for so long
as any indemnification claim is being adjudicated) with respect to actions or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date (such coverage to be on terms
and conditions and for an amount no less favorable to the Companys and its
Subsidiaries directors and officers currently covered by such insurance than
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof), and each of Buyer and the
Company agrees not to terminate or modify in a manner adverse to the
beneficiaries thereof the Tail Policy prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date.

(d) In the event that after the Closing Date, Buyer or the Company, or
their respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be, honor the indemnification and other obligations
of such Persons, including under this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_.

 

 _7.02_ _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Any and all Transfer Taxes shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half
by Seller when due. Buyer shall, at its own expense, file or cause to be filed
all necessary Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall, upon
Sellers request, promptly provide Seller with evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Seller that such Transfer Taxes have been paid by Buyer or
will be paid by Buyer in connection with the Closing. The parties shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the filing of any
Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, including joining in the execution of
any such Tax Return or other documentation where necessary.

 



37

    

(b) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or
cause to be timely filed, all income Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any Tax year or period ending on or before the Closing Date
(" _Pre-Closing Period_"). Such income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with prior practice of the respective Company or Subsidiary.
At least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account
any valid extensions) for filing, Seller shall provide copies of such income
Tax Returns to Buyer for its review and comment (although Seller may provide
only the portion of such income Tax Return that relates to the Company and its
Subsidiaries). Seller shall make such revisions as are reasonably requested
by Buyer, but only if such revisions affect the actual Tax Liability of Buyer.
Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed,
all other Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing
Period that are filed after the Closing Date. All Taxes payable with respect
to Pre-Closing Periods, including the Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_, shall be borne by Seller, except to the extent and
in such amount as such Taxes are reflected in Net Working Capital and actually
taken into account as a reduction of the Purchase Price or paid by
the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) or Seller prior to Closing, and
shall be paid to Buyer no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns.

 

(c) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any taxable
period that commences on or prior to the Closing Date and ends after the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "). At least thirty (30) Business Days
prior to the due date for filing, Buyer shall provide copies of any Straddle
Period income Tax Return to Seller for its review and comment. Buyer shall
make such revisions as are reasonably requested by Seller, but only if such
revisions affect the actual Tax Liability of Seller. All Taxes allocable
to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be borne
by Seller, except to the extent and in such amount as such Taxes are reflected
in Net Working Capital and actually taken into account as a reduction of the
Purchase Price or paid by the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) or Seller
prior to Closing, and shall be paid to Buyer no later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the date on which such Taxes are paid. For purposes of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_, the portion of such Taxes that relate to the portion
of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.02(d)_.

 

(d) For purposes allocating Taxes for a Straddle Period, the portion of
such Tax that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending as of the
Closing Date shall (i) in the case of property, ad valorem and other Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Tax period ending as of the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii)
in the case of income Taxes and/or any Tax based upon or related to gains,
receipts, gross margins, employment, sales, use, or other Taxes imposed on a
non-periodic basis reasonably allocable using a closing-of-the-books approach,
be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period
ended as of the Closing Date pursuant to an interim closing-of-the-books. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the allocations described in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(d)_ shall be made in a manner consistent with the prior
practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except for changes required by
Legal Requirement or fact.

 

(e) Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practical, such information (including
reasonable access to books and records, Tax Returns and Tax filings) and
assistance as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return, the
conduct of any Tax audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any Tax matter. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax audit or other Tax
proceedings and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and
other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this _Section_ __
_ 7.02(e)_. Any Tax audit or other Tax proceeding shall be deemed to be a
Third Person Claim subject to the procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.06_.

  



38

    

(f) Any Tax sharing agreement between (i) Seller and any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) any
Subsidiaries of the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and
shall have no further effect for any Tax year (whether the current year,
a future year or a past year), and none of Buyer, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have any Liability thereunder.

 

(g) After the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
settle or resolve a proposed Tax adjustment that relates to a Pre-Closing
Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 _7.03_ _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Closing who continue
employment with Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) following the Closing Date and are not
represented by a labor union or labor organization for collective bargaining
purposes (the " _Continuing Non-Union Employees_"), Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the service of each such
Continuing Non-Union Employee to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to
participate, levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan) and vesting under each
compensation, retirement, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit plan,
program or arrangement of Buyer and its Affiliates, but not including any
equity compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements (collectively,
the " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Continuing Non-Union Employee is
or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the extent service was
credited to such employee for such purposes under a comparable
Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent such credit
would not result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide or cause its relevant Affiliate to provide each Continuing Non-Union
Employee with (i)(A) base salary or base hourly rate and (B) cash incentive
compensation opportunity, in each case, in an amount that is no less favorable
than the base salary or base hourly rate and cash incentive compensation
opportunity provided by Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable, to similarly
situated employees of Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable; and (ii) employee
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to
similarly situated employees of Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable.

 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Buyer Benefit
Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA in which any Continuing Non-Union Employee is or becomes eligible to
participate, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
such Buyer Benefit Plan to waive all limitations as to required physical
examinations and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable under such Buyer Benefit Plan for such
Continuing Non-Union Employees and their eligible dependents to the same
extent that such required physical examinations and exclusions would not have
applied or would have been waived under the corresponding Plan in which such
Continuing Non-Union Employee was a participant immediately prior to his or
her commencement of participation in such Buyer Benefit Plan but, with respect
to long-term disability and life insurance benefits and coverage, solely to
the extent permitted under the terms and conditions of Buyers applicable
insurance contracts in effect as of the Closing Date.

 



39

    

(d) _Cooperation and Transition Services_.

 

(i) Seller, the Company, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall
cooperate in good faith and use reasonable best efforts to find a
commercially reasonable method to provide Continuing Union Employees with the
applicable level and type of employee benefits to which such Continuing Union
Employees may be entitled following the Closing under their
respective collective bargaining agreements, including pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which such Continuing Union
Employees would continue to participate in the Plans in which they
participated as of immediately prior to the Closing for a period of 12 months
following the Closing.

(ii) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, Seller, the Company
and their respective Affiliates shall use reasonable best efforts to (A)
facilitate a discussion between Buyer and its Affiliates and the labor unions
which represent the Continuing Union Employees regarding the level and type
of employee benefits to be provided to such Continuing Union Employees
following the Closing and (B) work with such labor unions and Buyer and its
Affiliates to implement a commercially reasonable method to provide such post-
Closing employee benefits to the Continuing Union Employees, including, if
applicable, through the Transition Services Agreement.

 

(e) Buyer, the Company and the Seller acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not create any
right in any other Person, including any employees, former employees, labor
union, labor organization, any participant in any Plan or any beneficiary
thereof or any right to continued employment with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ shall be deemed to amend any
Buyer Benefit Plan or to require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue
or amend any particular benefit plan before or after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and any such plan may be amended
or terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable Legal Requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, each Continuing Non-
Union Employee shall be subject to a background check and drug screening as a
condition of continued employment. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to prevent or restrict in any way the right of Buyer or its Affiliates to
terminate, reassign, promote or demote any of the Continuing Non-Union
Employees after the Closing or to change adversely or favorably the title,
powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, or terms or conditions
of employment of such employees. 

_7.04_ _Termination of Plans_.

 

(a) Seller and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each Continuing Non-Union Employee to remain eligible to participate in
each Plan (other than a Company Non-Union Plan) in which such Continuing Non-
Union Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing through the end
of the month in which the Closing Date occurs. Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each Continuing Non-Union Employee to be eligible
to participate, on the first day of the month immediately following the month
in which the Closing Date occurs, in any and all Buyer Benefit Plans to the
extent coverage under such Buyer Benefit Plan is replacing coverage under a
Plan in which such Continuing Non-Union Employee participated immediately
prior to the Closing. Prior to, but in no event later than, the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller and the Company shall take any
and all actions necessary and appropriate to terminate all Plans to the extent
applicable solely to Continuing Non-Union Employees (" _Company Non-Union
Plans_") effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date. Seller
shall bear all obligations and responsibility for any and all costs,
obligations, Liabilities, payment of benefits, provision of benefits and any
other obligation or Liability related to any Company Non-Union Plan, either
directly or as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.04(b)_, including the
termination, winding down, any distributions or payment of benefits following
or in connection with termination of any

 



40

    

 such Plan, whether or not such Liabilities occur or arise prior to, on or
after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not assume or
retain any obligations under or Liabilities with respect to, or receive any
right or interest in any trusts relating to, any assets of or any insurance,
administration or other contracts pertaining to, any Company Non-Union Plan,
and (ii) Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
shall not assume sponsorship of, any obligations under, or Liabilities with
respect to (including with respect to any employee of the Company
participating prior to the Closing in) any Company Non-Union Plan.

 

(b) Solely to the extent that Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company following the Closing) directly incur any cost, expense, obligation
or other Liability related to, arising from, or in connection with the
termination of the Plans under this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ (the " _Plan Costs_
"), Seller shall reimburse Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company
and its Subsidiaries) for any Plan Costs within thirty (30) Business Days of
Sellers receipt of Buyers or its Affiliates (including the Companys and
its Subsidiaries), as applicable, written statement of Plan Costs incurred
(together with reasonable supporting documentation of the Plan Costs so
incurred). All amounts payable to Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) by Seller under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.04(b)_
are to be paid in lawful money of the United States, at the address set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 11.03_, or at such other address as Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) may from time to time designate
by written notice to Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, the rights and
obligations contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.04(b)_ are in addition to, and
not in lieu of, any rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to
_Article IX_.

(c) At least one day prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, amend the defined contribution 401(k) plan in which
any Continuing Non-Union Employee participated prior to the Closing (the "
_Seller 401(k) Plan_ "), and take all other actions necessary or appropriate
to ensure that the Seller 401(k) Plan allows for rollovers, including the
promissory note or notes representing any plan loans outstanding to any
Continuing Non-Union Employee, subject to any applicable duty to bargain with
a labor union or labor organization. Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, establish or designate one or more qualified
defined contribution plans (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ") containing all
provisions necessary for acceptance of direct rollovers of "eligible rollover
distributions" (as defined in the Code) that Continuing Non-Union Employees
are eligible to receive from the Seller 401(k) Plan with the exception of
after-tax Roth deferral balances. Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_
__ _ 7.04(c)_ to the contrary, the Buyer 401(k) Plan shall not be required to
accept any assets or promissory note or notes representing any outstanding
plan loans from the Seller 401(k) Plan until the administrator of the Buyer
401(k) Plan has determined that the Buyer 401(k) Plans acceptance of such
assets would constitute an "eligible rollover distribution" within the meaning
of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code.

(d) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an updated
estimate from the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Fund (" _WCT Pension
Fund_ ") of the Companys withdrawal liability assuming a complete withdrawal
by the Company from the WCT Pension Fund in 2018.

(e) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the Soft- Drink Industry 
Local Union No. 710 Pension Plan a payoff letter, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, with respect to the prepayment in full of the
Companys mass withdrawal liability resulting from the termination by mass
withdrawal of the Soft- Drink Industry  Local Union No. 710 Pension Plan on
December 31, 2014. Seller shall pay all amounts payable under such payoff
letter within thirty (30) days after the date on which it receives such payoff
letter, such that following such prepayment neither Seller, the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to make any quarterly installment
payments relating thereto. From and after the date of this Agreement until
such time as such mass withdrawal liability is paid in full, Seller shall from
time to time, as and when due, make all quarterly installment
payments relating thereto on behalf of the Company.

 



41

    

_7.05_ _Further Assurances_. Subject to the limitations set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement, from time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 _7.06_ _Restrictive Covenants_. In consideration of the purchase price
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby:

(a) Seller agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, during the Restricted Period, directly or indirectly through any Person
other than Buyer, as an owner, principal, employee, partner, shareholder,
member, officer, director, manager, agent or otherwise, compete with, assist
in or provide financial resources to any activity which competes with or is
substantially similar to the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in any countries in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
do business as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date or at any time
during the Restricted Period; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
prohibit Seller and its Affiliates from collectively owning, solely as a
passive investment, 2% or less of the outstanding equity or debt securities
of a publicly traded entity.

(b) Seller agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
not to, during the Restricted Period, either directly or indirectly through
any Person other than Buyer, on Sellers behalf or on behalf of any other
Person, solicit or hire away, or attempt to solicit or hire away, any Person
employed in the eighteen (18) months before Closing by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not such employee is a full-time, part-time or
temporary employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or hire any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who at the time an offer
of employment is extended is fewer than eighteen (18) months removed from
service as an officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (provided,
that nothing herein shall be construed to restrict Seller from a general
solicitation not directed at any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries generally,
so long as neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates hires any such person). 

(c) Seller agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
during the Restricted Period, directly or indirectly through any Person other
than Buyer, on Sellers own behalf or on behalf of any other Person, solicit
or attempt to solicit any customer or supplier of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of offering or providing products or services that
are competitive with or substantially similar to the business of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for the purpose of inducing any customer or
supplier of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to reduce or discontinue
its business with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(d) Seller shall not, at any time after the Closing, use or disclose to
anyone except authorized personnel of Buyer or Buyers Representatives (or as
otherwise authorized in writing by Buyer) any trade secrets or confidential
matters concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their business,
including customer lists and credit records, employee data, sales
representatives and their territories, mailing lists, consultant arrangements,
pricing policies, operational methods, marketing plans or strategies,
product development and techniques or plans, research and development
programs and plans, business acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition
plans, designs and design projects, any confidential Intellectual Property and
any other research or business information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their business which any of Seller and the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries currently treats as confidential (whether or not a trade
secret under Legal Requirement). If Seller is or may be obligated to disclose
any such trade secret or confidential information pursuant to Legal
Requirement, regulation or legal process, then (if permitted by Legal
Requirement) Seller shall provide Buyer with prompt written notice before any
such disclosure sufficient to enable Buyer either to seek a protective order
or other

 



42

    

 appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive
compliance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.06(d)_ or both.
Nothing herein shall prevent Seller from using or disclosing information that
is generally available to the public other than as a result of Sellers
violation of this _Section_ __ _ 7.06(d)_. In addition, 18 U.S.C. §1833(b)
provides, in part: "(1) An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly
liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a
trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local
government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and
(ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected
violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a
lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. . (2) An
individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a
suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of
the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding,
if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under
seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court
order." Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with this statutory
protection.

(e) Seller hereby acknowledges the broad territorial scope of the
covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_, but acknowledges and
agrees that the restrictions are reasonable and enforceable in view of, among
other things, (i) the narrow range of activities prohibited, (ii) the national
and international markets in which the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries now operate, or in the future will operate, and in which the
products of such business are, or will be, sold, (iii) the confidential,
proprietary and trade secret information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and their business to which Seller had and/or may have had
access, (iv) the fact that a business which competes with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their business could greatly benefit if it were to
obtain the confidential information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or their business, (v) the sale and/or transfer of the Company Intellectual
Property pursuant to this Agreement, and (vi) the fact that Seller would have
an unfair competitive advantage if Seller were allowed to engage in the
competitive activities prohibited by this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_ in light of
the confidential, proprietary and trade secret information and/or goodwill
that Seller had as of the Closing Date.

(f) In addition, Seller acknowledges that the foregoing restrictions are
reasonable and agrees that in the event of any breach thereof, the harm to
Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their businesses, will be
irreparable and without adequate remedy at law and therefore that injunctive
relief with respect thereto will be appropriate.

(g) Whenever possible, each provision of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.06_ shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Legal
Requirement. If any provision of this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_ is held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any Legal Requirement,
(i) the parties hereto agree that such provision(s) shall be enforced to the
maximum extent permissible under Legal Requirement; and (ii) any invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability of a particular provision shall not affect any
other provision of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements. Further,
if any provision of this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_ is adjudicated to be invalid,
overly broad or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to delete, amend and/or reduce the
duration and/or scope of the provision adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable to the minimum extent necessary for such provision to
be adjudicated valid and enforceable; provided, however, that, such deletion
and/or reduction shall apply only with respect to the operation of this
Agreement in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made.

 

(h) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions in this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_
apply to all forms of communication, including written communications, verbal
communications, email communications, and all forms of electronic
communications through social media websites or applications that may be
broadly disseminated, including status updates, posts, direct/personal
messages, tweets, or retweets on LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, Facebook, or any
other form of electronic communication.

_7.07_ _Release_. Upon the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, owners, members, managers,
employees, directors, officers, predecessors, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ "), hereby, irrevocably
and unconditionally, fully and forever acquit, release, covenant not to sue,
discharge and agree to hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, owners, members, managers,
employees, agents, attorneys, representatives, predecessors, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Releasees_ "), from any and all actions, claims,
charges, demands, damages, losses, obligations, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including attorneys fees and court costs), causes of action, debts,
contracts, torts, covenants, fiduciary duties, responsibilities, suits and
judgments, at law or in equity, of every nature and kind that Seller or any of
the other Releasing Parties have, may have had or may have in the future
against the Releasees, whether known or unknown, for all matters relating to,
arising out of or in connection with the status of Seller as an owner of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from the beginning of time through the
date hereof, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement. The release
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_ shall be binding upon the Releasing
Parties and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the
benefit of the Releasees and their respective successors and assigns.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _TERMINATION_

 

 _8.01_ _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 

(b) by Buyer, if there has been a material violation or breach by Seller or
the Company of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement that would prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of Buyer at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been
waived by Buyer or, in the case of a violation or breach that is curable
through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts within twenty (20)
days, cured by Seller or the Company within twenty (20) days after written
notice thereof from Buyer (so long as Seller and the Company continue to
exercise such commercially reasonable efforts during such period); _provided_
, _however_ , that Buyer is not then in material breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty of this Agreement so as to cause any conditions set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.02_ not to be satisfied;

(c) by either Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, by
written notice to the other party if any Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over such matters shall have issued any Order permanently

_provided_ , _however_ , that the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)_ shall
not be available to any party unless such party shall have complied in
all material respects with its obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.05_
with respect to such Order;

 

(d) by Seller, if there has been a material violation or breach by Buyer of
any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that

or the Company at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived
by Seller or, in the case of a violation or breach that is curable through
the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts within twenty (20) days, cured
by Buyer within twenty (20) days after written notice thereof by Seller (so
long as Buyer continues to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts
during such period) ( _provided_ _that_ the failure of Buyer to deliver the
consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.03_ at the Closing as required
hereunder shall not be subject to cure hereunder unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by Seller); _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller is not then in
material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty of this Agreement
so as to cause any conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ not to be
satisfied;

 



44

    

(e) by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing has not occurred on or before
January 31, 2019 (such date, the " _Drop Dead Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that if as of the Drop Dead Date all of the conditions set forth in _Article
II_ (other than the conditions set forth in  _Sections 2.01(c)_ and _2.02(c)_
and those conditions that by the their nature can only be satisfied at
Closing) have been satisfied, then Buyer or Seller may extend such date for up
to an additional nine (9) months by delivery of written notice of such
extension to the other party not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Drop Dead Date; provided further, that neither Buyer nor Seller shall be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; or

 

(f) by Buyer in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.07_.

 

(g) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _clauses
(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_  or _(f)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ shall

 _8.02_ _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Buyer or Seller as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, the
provisions of this Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further
force and effect and there shall be no liability on the part of any of Buyer,
Seller or the Company to one another, except that (a) _ Section_ __ _ 8.02_
and _Articles X_ and _XI_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
(b) nothing in this Agreement will relieve any party from any intentional and
material breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

ARTICLE IX

 _9.05_ _Notice of Claim_.

 

(a) In the event that a Buyer seeks indemnification on behalf of a Buyer
Indemnified Person, or Seller seeks indemnification on behalf of a Seller
Indemnified Person, including with respect to any pending or threatened Third
Person Claim, such party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
shall give reasonably prompt written notice (each, an " _Indemnification
Claim Certificate_ ") to the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
specifying in reasonable detail the facts constituting the basis for such
claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted; _provided_
, however, that the rights of an Indemnified Party shall not be adversely
affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent
that, an Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. If
the Indemnifying Party does not object in writing to the Indemnified Party,
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_, to any individual items of Indemnified
Losses set forth in an Indemnification Claim Certificate delivered pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 9.05(a)_ within thirty (30) days after delivery of
such Indemnification Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed
to have consented to the Indemnified Partys recovery of the full amount of
all such items of Indemnified Loss set forth in such Indemnification Claim
Certificate. The Indemnifying Party shall pay, or shall cause the Escrow Agent
to pay, as the case may be, the full amount of any undisputed Indemnified
Losses in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.05(d)_ (including the undisputed
portion of any Indemnified Losses where there may be both an undisputed and a
disputed portion).

 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party seeks to contest any individual items of
Indemnified Losses set forth in an Indemnification Claim Certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.05(a)_, the Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnified Party in writing, within thirty (30) days after such
Indemnification Claim Certificate is delivered, of the Indemnifying Partys
objection, which notice shall

 



47

    

 set forth a brief description in reasonable detail of the Indemnifying
Partys basis for objecting to each item of Indemnified Losses based on the
Indemnifying Partys good faith belief thereof. Upon delivery of a written
notice of objection from the Indemnifying Party pursuant to the preceding
sentence, Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties regarding the disputed items of Indemnified
Loss. If Buyer and Seller should so agree, a memorandum setting forth the
agreement reached shall be prepared and signed by both parties (on behalf of
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party). The Indemnifying Party
shall pay the full amount of such agreed Indemnified Losses in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 9.05(d)_.

 

(c) If within sixty (60) days after notice to the Indemnifying Party
regarding such Indemnification Claim Certificate, and after good faith
negotiations, the parties are unable to agree on the rights of the respective
parties regarding any disputed items of Indemnified Loss set forth in an
Indemnification Claim Certificate, either Buyer or Seller may bring suit in
the courts identified in _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ to resolve the matter. The
amount of indemnification to which a Person shall be entitled under this
_Article IX_ shall be determined by a final judgment, order or decree in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.13_. The judgment, order or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals shall
have been finally determined. The Indemnifying Party shall pay the full
amount of such judgment in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.05(d)_ (or as
otherwise ordered by the applicable court).

 

(d) If, following the procedures set forth above, Indemnified Losses are
payable to a Buyer Indemnified Person, such Indemnified Losses shall be paid
to Buyer in cash within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of
the amount thereof. If, following the procedures set forth above, the
Indemnified Losses are payable to a Seller Indemnified Person, such
Indemnified Losses shall be paid to Seller in cash within five (5) Business
Days of the final determination of the amount thereof.

 

 _9.06_ _Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons_.

 

(a) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to seek indemnification hereunder
because of a claim asserted by any claimant other than a Seller Indemnified
Person or Buyer Indemnified Person (a " _Third Person_ "), the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after
such assertion is actually known to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
however, that the right of a Person to be indemnified hereunder in respect of
claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to
give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying
Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 9.06_, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, and using counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest or
settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a " _Third Person Claim_ "),
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party has unconditionally acknowledged to
the Indemnified Party in writing that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder for all Indemnified Losses arising out of such Third
Person Claim and that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
entire amount of any such Indemnified Losses, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement and so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party thereafter
consults with the Indemnified Party upon the Indemnified Partys reasonable
request for such consultation from time to time with respect to such Third
Person Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third
Person Claim actively and diligently, (iii) the Third Person Claim involves
only a claim for money damages, in an amount equal to or less than the amount
then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (iv) the Third Party Claim does
not involve a claim (A) for a temporary restraining order, (B) for a
preliminary or permanent injunction, (C) for specific performance against the
Indemnified Party, (D) with criminal allegations against the Indemnified
Party, (E) that, if unsuccessful, would set a precedent that would materially
interfere with, or have a material adverse effect on, the business or
financial condition of the Indemnified Party and (F) that imposes Liability on
the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder and (v) the 

 



48

    

 Indemnifying Party obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party with respect to any settlement (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). In the event any of the foregoing conditions are or become
unsatisfied, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to defend against the Third Person Claim. The Indemnified Party
may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend such Third Person
Claim prior to the time that it receives a notice from the Indemnifying Party
assuming the defense of such Third Person Claim as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 9.06(a)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the costs and
expenses of any such actions taken by the Indemnified Party.

(b) In the event the Indemnifying Party provides the acknowledgement
required by _Section_ __ _ 9.06(a)_ and the conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 9.06(a)_ are satisfied, the Indemnified Party may thereafter participate
in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own
counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to
avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at
the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the
Indemnifying Party so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify as required by
_Section_ __ _ 9.06(a)_ and the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.06(a)_ are satisfied, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its
option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to look to the
Indemnifying Party for the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense.

 

(c) The failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to the
aforesaid notice of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Person
Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof shall be deemed an
irrevocable election not to defend the same. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.06_, in connection with any
Third Person Claim in which the Indemnified Party shall reasonably conclude
that (i) there is a threat of any relief other than solely monetary damages
being granted, (ii) there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of such Third
Person Claim or (iii) there are specific defenses available to the Indemnified
Party which are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party and which could be materially adverse to the
Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume
and direct the defense of such Third Person Claim. In such an event, with
respect to the costs of defending such Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying
Party need only pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel of the
Indemnifying Party and one counsel to all the Indemnified Parties. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so acknowledge its obligation to indemnify and
assume the defense of any such Third Person Claim or the Indemnified Party
otherwise exercises its rights contained herein to assume and direct the
defense of such Third Person Claim, (x) the Indemnified Party may
defend against such claim using counsel of its choice, in such manner as it
may reasonably deem appropriate, including settling such claim, after giving
notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified
Party may reasonably deem appropriate, and (y) the Indemnifying Party may
participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its own
counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to
question the manner in which the Indemnified Party defended such Third Person
Claim or the amount or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party
shall have the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that conduct
of the Indemnified Party in the defense and/or settlement of such Third
Person Claim constituted negligence or willful misconduct.

(d) The parties hereto shall make available to each other all relevant
information in their possession relating to any such Third Person Claim and
shall cooperate in the defense thereof.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __
_ 9.06,_ the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control, but may
participate in, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole
control, including the right to select defense counsel, over the defense or
settlement of any claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against the
Indemnified Party, (ii) that involves criminal allegations against the
Indemnified Party, (iii) that, if unsuccessful, would set a precedent that
would materially interfere with, or have a material adverse effect on, the
business or financial condition of the Indemnified Party or (iv) imposes
Liability on the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification hereunder. In such event, the Indemnifying
Party shall remain subject to its obligations hereunder.

 



49

    

_9.07_ _Indemnity Escrow Fund_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, except for the remedies of specific performance, injunction and other
equitable relief, including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, the Indemnity
Escrow Fund shall be the exclusive source to compensate the Buyer Indemnified
Persons for the indemnification obligations of Seller under this _Article IX_
; provided, however, that with respect to any claims based on (a) any
inaccuracy of any of the Company Fundamental Representations, the
Seller Fundamental Representations or the SOL Representations (if and only to
the extent insufficient assets remain in the Indemnity Escrow Fund), (b) the
indemnification obligations under _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)(i)_ following the
release of the Indemnity Escrow Fund on the twelve (12) month anniversary of
the Closing Date (or the next Business Day if such date is not a Business Day)
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.07_, (c) the indemnification
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_ (other than _Section_ __ _
9.02(a)(i)_) or (d) Fraud Claims, the Buyer Indemnified Persons, subject to
the limitations and other terms of this _Article IX_, shall be entitled to
seek compensation for any Losses under this _Article IX_ directly from
Seller. Any amounts payable to the Buyer Indemnified Persons under this
_Article IX_ (other than amounts that the Buyer Indemnified Persons
may recover directly from Seller in accordance with this _Article IX_) shall
be paid by the Escrow Agent (on behalf of Seller) to such Buyer Indemnified
Person out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. On the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date
(or the next Business Day if such date is not a Business Day), the Escrow
Agent shall release to Seller any amounts then remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund less the amount of any pending and unresolved claims for
indemnity under this _Article IX_.

_9.08_ _Exceptions to Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no limitation on
indemnification provided for in this _Article IX_ or otherwise in this
Agreement shall apply to any Losses incurred by an Indemnified Party to the
extent that such Losses arise from any Fraud Claim.

_9.09_ _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All (a)
indemnification payments made under this Agreement and (b) amounts released
from the Simril Escrow Fund to Kenneth M. Simril, on behalf of the Company,
and employment Taxes and required withholdings to which such amounts are
subject, shall in each case be treated by the parties hereto as an adjustment
to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Legal Requirement.

 _11.11_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING

CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)

THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.11_.

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of
damages, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with

by this Agreement and without that right, none of Seller, the Company or
Buyer would have entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of specific

 



61

    

 performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
have an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The parties
acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction.

out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Legal Requirements
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of the Legal Requirements of another jurisdiction.

 

(b) Any action, suit or proceeding based upon, arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in
the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or, in the case of
claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware), and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such action, suit or
proceeding, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to personal
jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in
respect of the action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined only
in any such court, and agrees not to bring any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect
the right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by Legal
Requirement or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any
other party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments
obtained in any action, suit or proceeding brought pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 11.13(b)_.

_11.14_ _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) Buyer for itself and its Affiliates, including the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and for its and their respective successors and assigns,
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between Seller or
its Affiliates, including the Company or its Subsidiaries, and its or their
counsel, including Husch Blackwell LLP, made in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement
which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be privileged
communications of Seller or their Affiliates, including the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and their counsel and would not be subject to disclosure to
Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with any process relating to a dispute,
litigation or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement
or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing to be privileged communications
between Seller or its Affiliates, including the Company or its Subsidiaries,
and such counsel and none of Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any Person
acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer or any Affiliate of
Buyer shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the
privilege attaching to such communications belongs to Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer, including the Company or its Subsidiaries, and not Seller or its
Affiliates; provided, however, that such any such counsel, including Husch
Blackwell LLP, agrees that no confidential information regarding the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that such counsel has gained in connection with
its representation of Seller or its Affiliates, including the Company or its
Subsidiaries, will following the Closing be conveyed to Seller or its
Affiliates to the extent not previously conveyed prior to the Closing, or
otherwise be used by such counsel to the detriment of Buyer or its Affiliates,
including the Company and its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties to this Agreement agree that all pre-Closing communications between or
among Husch Blackwell LLP, the Company, and Seller that relate in any way to
this Agreement or the

 



62

    

 transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client privilege and all
other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to the Seller and may be
controlled by the Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the
Company. Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Company may retain and
remove all documents, emails and other non-email electronic documents
concerning any merger, acquisition or sale of the Company or any of its
assets. It is acknowledged and agreed to by the parties that a failure by the
Company and the Seller to remove materials identified in the foregoing
sentence, to the extent that such materials are otherwise protected by the
attorney-client or work product privileges, is inadvertent and that the Seller
shall, after receiving written notice from Buyer of said failure, to the
extent discovered and known by Buyer to constitute materials identified in
the foregoing sentence, have ninety (90) days (the " _Recovery Period_ ") to
request the return of such documents from Buyer and/or the Company and its
Subsidiaries, which return shall be at the cost of Seller. At all times prior
to the lapse of the Recovery Period, Buyer agrees not to knowingly take any
actions (and will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to knowingly take
any actions) with regard to the documents that would be inconsistent with such
claims of privilege.

(b) Buyer acknowledges that its consent and waiver under this _Section_ __
_ 11.14_ is voluntary and informed and that Buyer has obtained independent
legal advice with respect to this consent and waiver. Without limiting
anything set forth in this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
Seller is relying on the foregoing consent and waiver set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 11.14_.

_11.15_ _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give
any Person, other than the parties hereto, any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement except for (a) in the event the Closing occurs, the
present and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(and their successors, heirs and representatives) are intended third-party
beneficiaries of, and may enforce,  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, and (b) the past,
present and future directors, officers, employees, incorporators, members,
partners, stockholders, Affiliates, agents, attorneys, advisors and
representatives of the parties, and any Affiliate of any of the foregoing
(and their successors, heirs and representatives), are intended third-party
beneficiaries of, and may enforce, _Section_ __ _ 11.16_.

 

 _11.16_ _Non-Recourse_. Except with respect to any Fraud Claim,
this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the entities that are
expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall limit the rights and remedies of (i)
