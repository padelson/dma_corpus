accountants (including information of the Company) and otherwise cooperate fully with the Accounting Referee&#146;s review of the dispute, and each party shall be afforded the opportunity to present the Accounting Referee (with a copy concurrently

after the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-day</FONT> resolution period. With respect to any disputed item, the Accounting Referee shall only be permitted to select as a resolution the position of either Buyer or Seller. It is the intent of
Buyer, Seller and the Company that the process set forth in this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;1.04</U> and the activities of the Accounting Referee in connection herewith are not intended to be and, in fact, are not arbitration and that no formal

on the one hand, and/or Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the aggregate contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by such party, as determined by the
Accounting Referee. For example, if Buyer claims that the Net Working Capital Amount is $10,000 less than the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount determined by the Company, and Seller contests only $5,000 of the amount claimed by Buyer, and if the
Accounting Referee ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Buyer $3,000 of the $5,000 contested, then the cost of such review and report will be allocated 60% (i.e., 3,000 &divide; 5,000) to Seller and 40% (i.e., 2,000 &divide; 5,000) to Buyer.
