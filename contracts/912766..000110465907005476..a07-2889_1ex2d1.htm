Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of the
certificate formerly representing such share of Common Stock (a "
_Certificate_ ") in the manner provided in Section 2.3. Such shares of Common
Stock (including any Company Restricted Shares), other than those canceled or
remaining outstanding pursuant to Section 2.2(a), sometimes are referred to
herein as the " _Merger Shares_."

  

### (d) No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  

### (e) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
number of shares of outstanding Common Stock is changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or the like, other than pursuant to the Merger, the amount
of Merger Consideration payable per share of Common Stock shall be
correspondingly adjusted.

  

### (f) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that
the contribution of shares of Common Stock (including Company Restricted
Shares, if any) to Parent pursuant to the Equity Rollover Commitments shall
be deemed to occur immediately prior to the Effective Time and prior to any
other above-described event.

  

### (g) The Company Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as provided in Section 2.4.

  

Section 2.3 _ _Payment of Cash for Merger Shares_._

  

### (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to serve as the
disbursing agent for the Merger Consideration and payments in respect of the
Company Options, unless another agent is designated as provided in Section
2.4(a) (the " _Disbursing Agent_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent will cause to be deposited with the Disbursing Agent cash in the
aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of all
Merger Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus any
cash necessary to pay for Company Options and Company Performance Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.4.
Pending distribution of the cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent, such
cash shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares,
Company Options and Company Performance Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and shall not be used for any other purposes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may direct the Disbursing Agent to
invest such cash in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, (ii) money market accounts,
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreement or bankers acceptances
of, or demand deposits with, commercial banks having a combined capital and
surplus of at least $500,000,000, or (iii) commercial paper obligations rated
P-1 or A-1 or better by Standard and Poors Corporation or Moodys Investor

        

Services, Inc. Any profit or loss resulting from, or interest and other
income produced by, such investments shall be for the account of Parent.

  

### (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall send, or cause the Disbursing Agent to send, to each record
holder of Merger Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time a
letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for
the Merger Consideration payable therefor. The letter of transmittal will be
in customary form and will specify that delivery of Certificates will be
effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Disbursing Agent. Upon surrender of such Certificate
or Certificates to the Disbursing Agent together with a properly completed
and duly executed letter of transmittal and any other documentation that
the Disbursing Agent may reasonably require, the record holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable in exchange
therefor, without interest. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such
Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and until such surrender and
exchange, no cash shall be paid to the holder of such outstanding Certificate
in respect thereof.

  

### (c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder
of the Merger Shares formerly represented by the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to
such payment that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Disbursing Agent any
applicable stock transfer taxes required as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Merger Shares or establish to
the satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent that such stock transfer taxes have
been paid or are not payable.

  

### (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Disbursing Agent, such shares shall be canceled and exchanged for
the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article II.

  

### (e) If any cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed
twelve months after the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holder who has not
surrendered such holders Certificates for the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any holder
of Certificates for an amount paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of Certificates as of a date immediately prior to such time that such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

        

### (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate.

  

### (g) Except as provided in Section 2.2(a), from and after the Effective
Time, the holders of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Common Stock, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Agreement.

  

### (h) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in addition to the posting by
such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation or the Disbursing Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent
with respect to such Certificate, the Disbursing Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration in
respect thereof entitled to be received pursuant to this Agreement.

  

### (i) Parent, Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable hereunder any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any
applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder
from whose Merger Consideration the amounts were so deducted and withheld.

  

Section 2.4 _ _Treatment of Company Equity Awards__.

  

### (a) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a
holder of Company Options with respect to such holders Company Options or as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Company Option which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or
unvested, exercisable or not exercisable) will be canceled and extinguished
by the Company, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Corporation in consideration for such cancellation promptly
following the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Option
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over
(y) the exercise price per share of such Company Option, without interest and
less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any applicable
Law. In the event that the per share exercise price of any Company Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall
be canceled without payment therefor and have no further force or effect.
 All payments with respect to canceled Company Options shall be made by the
Disbursing Agent (or such other agent reasonably acceptable to Parent as the
Company shall designate prior to the Effective Time) as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or
at the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in
accordance with Section 2.3.

  

### (b) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a
holder of unvested Company Restricted Shares or as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, with respect to such holders unvested Company Restricted Shares,
each unvested Company

        

Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
vest and become free of restrictions as of the Effective Time and shall, as
of the Effective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest and
less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any applicable
Law.

  

### (c) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a
holder of Company Performance Shares with respect to such holders Company
Performance Shares, each Company Performance Share which, in each case, is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or
unvested) shall be canceled by the Company and the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive promptly following the Effective Time from the Surviving
Corporation, in consideration for such cancellation, an amount equal to the
product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number
of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Share, without
interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any
applicable Law.

  

### (d) Those certain unvested Company Options and Company Restricted Shares
set forth in Section 2.4(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall, in lieu
of becoming vested and canceled in exchange for the applicable payments
described in Sections 2.4(a) and 2.4(b) above, respectively, be canceled in
exchange for the payment in cash of a retention bonus, subject to certain
vesting requirements, all as described in Section 2.4(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  

### (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions
and will take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate
the actions contemplated by this Section 2.4, without paying any
consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (f) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent (or such
other agent reasonably acceptable to the Company as Parent shall designate
prior to the Effective Time) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts to be paid under this Section 2.4 in respect of Company Options
and Company Performance Shares amounts required to be deducted and withheld
under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
holder of Company Options and Company Performance Shares from whose payments
in respect of Company Options and Company Performance Shares the amounts were
so deducted and withheld.

Adverse Effect on the Company or (ii) would not prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger or the Companys ability to observe and
perform its obligations hereunder.

  

Section 4.13 _ _Taxes_._ Except as have not had or would not be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect

option, severance, retention, employee loan, collective bargaining,
employment, change-in-control, fringe benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation and all other material employee benefit plans, agreements,

        

programs, policies or other arrangements, whether or not subject to ERISA,
whether formal or informal, oral or written, legally binding or not, under
which any Company Employee has any present or future right to benefits and
which is maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its U.S.
Material Subsidiaries or under which the Company or any of its U.S. Material
Subsidiaries has any present or future liability. Each Company Benefit Plan
has been operated, funded and administered in compliance with its terms, the
terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement and with all
applicable requirements of Law, including ERISA and the Code, except as would
not subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any liability that has
had or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as has not had and would not
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
any officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Benefit
Plan that is subject to ERISA, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trust
created thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a

or its Subsidiaries, either directly or by reason of their affiliation with
any member of their "Controlled Group" (defined as any organization which is
a member of a controlled group of organizations within the meaning
of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code), to any tax, fine,
lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other
applicable laws, rules and regulations.

  

### (c) Except in the ordinary course of business or as required by
applicable Law, since September 30, 2006, there has been no amendment to
any Company Benefit Plan that would increase materially the expense to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of maintaining such plan above the level
of the expense incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries therefor for the
most recent fiscal year. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, the
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not (either alone or together with any other related
event) (i) result in any material payment by the Company or any of its
Material Subsidiaries to any Company Employee of any money or other property
under any Company Benefit Plan or Company Stock Plan or (ii) result in the
accelerated vesting or funding through a trust or otherwise of a material
amount of compensation or benefits under any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Stock Plan or (iii) result in payments under any Company Benefit Plan which
would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

  

Section 4.15 _ _Compliance With Laws__

  

### (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is, and at all times has
been, in compliance with all Laws applicable to the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their respective businesses and activities, except for such noncompliance

reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

### (b) The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company has and maintains in
full force and effect, and is in compliance with, all Permits and all orders
from Governmental Authorities necessary for the Company and each Subsidiary
to carry on their respective businesses as currently conducted and currently
proposed to be conducted, except as has not had, and would not be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

  

### (c) The Domestic Institution is and, since July 1, 2003, has been, duly
qualified as, and in material compliance with the DOE definition of, a
"proprietary institution of higher education."

  

### (d) The Domestic Institution has not derived more than ninety percent
(90%) of its revenues from Title IV Program funds, as determined
in accordance with DOEs "90/10 Rule" as codified at 34 C.F.R. §600.5(a)(8),
for any fiscal year reporting period required by the DOE ended on or after
July 1, 2003.

  

### (e) Neither the Company, nor any person or entity that exercises
Substantial Control over the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Domestic
Institution (as the term "Substantial Control" is used in 34
C.F.R. §668.174(b) and (c)) (" _Substantial Control_ "), or member of such
persons family (as the term "family" is defined in 34 C.F.R. §600.21(f)),
alone or together, (A) exercises or exercised Substantial Control over an
institution other than the Domestic Institution or over a third-party
servicer (as that term is defined in 34 C.F.R. §668.2) that owes a liability
for a violation of a Title IV Program or other HEA program requirement, or
(B) owes a liability for a Title IV Program or other HEA program violation.
At no time has the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or the Domestic
Institution, nor any person or entity that exercises Substantial Control over
any of them, filed for relief in bankruptcy or had entered against it an
order for relief in bankruptcy. None of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or the Domestic Institution, nor any person or entity that
exercises Substantial Control over any of them, has pled guilty to, has pled
nolo contendere to, or has been found guilty of a crime involving the
acquisition, use, or expenditure of funds under the Title IV Programs or has
been judicially determined to have committed fraud involving funds under the
Title IV Programs. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company, nor
any of its Subsidiaries, or the Domestic Institution currently employs any
individual or entity in a capacity that involves the administration or
receipt of funds under the Title IV Programs, or contracted with
any institution or third-party servicer, which has been terminated under the
Title IV Programs for a reason involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure
of federal, state or local government funds, or has been convicted of, or has
pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use
or expenditure of federal, state, or local government funds, or has
been administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any
other material violation of law involving federal, state, or local government
funds.

  

### (f) As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, there exist
no facts or circumstances attributable to the Company or any Affiliate of the
Company that would reasonably be expected to cause the DOE to refuse to
deliver a written response that would

        

satisfy the condition set forth in Section 8.2(d) of this Agreement. As of
the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any
Affiliate of the Company has been or is subject to any actions, suits,
proceedings, investigations, audits, program reviews or claims that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the issuance by the DOE of a
written response that would satisfy the condition set forth in Section 8.2(d)
of this Agreement.

this Agreement. The Company has provided to Parent a complete and correct
copy of any Contract between the Company and Morgan Stanley and Co.
Incorporated and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, relating
to any such fees.

  

Section 4.17 _ _Opinion of Financial Advisors_._ Each of Morgan Stanley and
Co. Incorporated and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated
has delivered to the Special Committee an opinion to the effect that, as of
the Execution Date, the consideration to be received by holders of Common
Stock (other than any holder who will contribute Common Stock to Parent) in
the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

  

Section 4.18 _ _Anti-Takeover Provisions_._ The Board of Directors of the
Company has taken all necessary action so that any takeover, anti-takeover,
moratorium, "fair price", "control share" or other similar Law enacted under
any Law applicable to the Company (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") do not,
and will not, apply to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company does not have any stockholder rights plan in
effect.

performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation

ability to observe and perform its material obligations hereunder.

  

Section 5.4 _ _Non-Contravention_._ The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation
by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene or conflict with the

compliance with the items specified in Section 5.3, contravene, conflict with
or constitute a violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or

to or filing with any third party with respect to, result in any breach or
violation of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default), or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of any right or
obligation of Parent or Merger Sub or to a loss of any material benefit to
which Parent or Merger Sub is entitled under any Contract.

  

Section 5.5 _ _Disclosure Documents_._ None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates (other than

will, at the date it is filed with the SEC (in the case of the Schedule
13E-3), at the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company (in the
case of the Company Proxy Statement), or at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

  

Section 5.6 _ _Finders  Fees_._ No agent, broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other firm or Person except Goldman, Sachs and Co.

complete copies of (i) the debt commitment letters dated as of the Execution
Date from Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. and Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. (collectively, the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which
the lenders party thereto committed, subject to the terms thereof, to lend
the amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) the equity
commitment letters, dated as of the Execution Date, from each of the Persons
listed in Section 5.7 of the Parent Disclosure Letter (the " _Equity
Financing Commitments_ " and together with the Debt Financing Commitments,
the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which such parties have

Commitments has been amended or modified, and (ii) the respective commitments
contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect. As of the Execution Date, the Financing Commitments are in
full force and effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent
and to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. As of the
Execution Date, assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties contained herein, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any
direct investor in Parent has any knowledge that any event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any direct investor in
Parent under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments or otherwise
be reasonably likely to result in any portion of the Financing contemplated
thereby to be unavailable. The only conditions precedent to the obligations
of the lenders and other Persons committing pursuant to the Financing
Commitments to make the Financing available to Parent or its Affiliates are
those contemplated by the terms of the Financing Commitments. As of
the Execution Date, assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations
and warranties contained herein, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of the
direct investors in Parent has any reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to be satisfied by it and
contained in the Financing Commitments. Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other
fees required by the terms of the Financing Commitments to be paid on or
before the Execution Date. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Financing Commitments and this Agreement and assuming the accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties contained herein, the proceeds from
the Financing constitute all of the financing required to be provided by
Parent for the consummation of the Merger upon the terms set forth in this
Agreement and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        

Section 5.8 _ _Equity Rollover Commitments__ _._ Parent has delivered to the
Company true and complete copies of the equity rollover letters (the "
_Equity Rollover Commitments_ "), dated as of the Execution Date, from each

_Rollover Entities_ "), pursuant to which such parties have committed to
contribute to Parent that number of shares of Common Stock set forth in such
letters for shares of membership interests of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time. As of the Execution Date, the Equity Rollover Commitments are
in full force and effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations of
Parent and the other parties thereto. The only conditions precedent to the
obligations of each of the Rollover Entities under the Equity
Rollover Commitments are those contemplated by the terms of the Equity
Rollover Commitments. As of the Execution Date, assuming the accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties contained herein, neither Parent,
Merger Sub nor any direct investor in Parent has any knowledge that any event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach under any term or condition of the Equity
Rollover Commitments or otherwise be reasonably likely to result in any
portion of the commitments contemplated thereby to be unavailable. As of the
Execution Date, assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations
and warranties contained herein, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any direct
investor in Parent has any reason to believe that any of the Rollover
Entities will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to
be satisfied by it and contained in the Equity Rollover Commitments.

  

Section 5.9 _ _Merger Sub_._ Merger Sub has been formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the
Effective Time will have engaged in no other business activities and will
have incurred no liabilities or obligations other than in connection with the

as set forth in Section 5.10 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, no direct or
indirect equity investor in Parent or Merger Sub, or any Affiliate thereof
(other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), is subject to any voting
trust or other agreement, arrangement or restriction with respect to the
voting of any Common Stock it owns beneficially (determined for the purposes
of this paragraph as set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) or of record in respect of the Merger or any transaction involving a
Company Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal or any other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

## Section 5.11 _ _Compliance with Laws; Education Consents__.  (a) None
of Parent or Merger Sub nor any person or entity that exercises
Substantial Control over Parent or Merger Sub, or member of such persons
family (as the term "family" is defined in 34 C.F.R. §600.21(f)), alone or
together, (A) exercises or exercised Substantial Control over any institution

servicer, which has been terminated under the Title IV Programs for a reason
involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of federal, state or local
government funds, or has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or
guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use or expenditure of
federal, state, or local government funds, or has been administratively or
judicially determined to have committed fraud or any other material violation
of law involving federal, state, or local government funds.

  

### (b) As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub,
there exist no facts or circumstances attributable to Parent or Merger Sub,
to any Person in which Parent or Merger Sub has an interest, or to any
Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub (other than portfolio companies or
portfolio investments), that would reasonably be expected to cause the DOE to
refuse to deliver a written response that would satisfy the condition set
forth in Section 8.2(d) of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, to
the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, none of Parent, Merger Sub, any
Person in which Parent or Merger Sub has an interest, or any Affiliate of
Parent or Merger Sub (other than portfolio companies or portfolio
investments), has been or is subject to any actions, suits, proceedings,
investigations, audits, program reviews or claims that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or delay the issuance by the DOE of a written response
that would satisfy the condition set forth in Section 8.2(d) of this
Agreement.

advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation
to effect all necessary filings, consents, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, Permits or orders from all Governmental Authorities or other
Persons and, in the case of Parent, using reasonable best efforts to enforce
any remedies available to Parent in the Investors Agreement. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party ** ** **** hereto agrees
to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and in any event
within 21 Business Days) and to make, or cause to be made, the filings and
authorizations required under the Other Antitrust Laws of jurisdictions other
than the United States and under applicable Law with respect to the DOE and
any other applicable Education Departments and Accrediting Bodies as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as

Act or the Other Antitrust Laws of jurisdictions other than the United States
as soon as practicable; provided that in no event shall any member or other
holder of interests in Parent, or any Affiliate of any member of Parent, be

other than the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting
the foregoing, the parties shall request and shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act.

  

### (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
7.2(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts
to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry, including any

        

proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably
informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the DOE or any other
Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to
review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ, the DOE or
any other Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC,
the DOJ, the DOE or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other
person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences.

  

### (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 7.2(a) and (b), if any objections are asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Law or if any suit
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any
other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any
of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Law or
which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such
objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections
or suits which, in any case if not resolved, would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, including selling, holding
separate or otherwise disposing of or conducting its business in a manner
which would resolve such objections or suits or agreeing to sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its business in a manner which
would resolve such objections or suits or permitting the sale, holding
separate or other disposition of, any of its assets or the assets of its
Subsidiaries or the conducting its business in a manner which would resolve
such objections or suits, so long as such actions, individually or in the
aggregate, do not have, and would not be reasonably likely to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Company may expressly condition any such sale, holding separate or other
disposal, and any agreement to take any such action or to conduct its
business in any manner, upon consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_
, that in no event shall any member or other holder of interests in Parent,
or any Affiliate of any member of Parent, be required to take any action
with respect to any portfolio company or agree to undertake any divestiture
or restrict its conduct with regard to any business other than the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Without excluding other possibilities,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be
materially delayed if unresolved objections or suits delay or would
reasonably be expected to delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby beyond the End Date.

  

### (d) Subject to the obligations under Section 7.2(c), in the event that
any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or private party
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use
its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have

        

vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### (e) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries and Parent will cooperate
with each other and will take all commercially reasonable steps, and proceed
diligently and in good faith (i) to submit a pre-acquisition
review application for the Domestic Institution with the DOE within twenty-
one (21) Business Days of the date of this Agreement and (ii) promptly to
submit and make other applications, notices and submissions with the DOE and
other Education Departments and Accrediting Bodies which must be filed prior
to the Closing in order for the Company to obtain (a) all Education
Department and Accrediting Body approvals and permits which must be obtained
prior to the Closing in order for the Surviving Corporation to operate the
Domestic Institution and Foreign Institutions as they are currently operated
and for the Domestic Institution and Foreign Institutions to participate in
all of the Student Financial Assistance Programs, including the Title IV
Programs, under the ownership of the Surviving Corporation (collectively, the
" _Pre-Closing Education Consents_ ", identified as such in Section 7.2(e)(i)
of the Company Disclosure Letter), and (b) all Education Department and
Accrediting Body approvals and permits which must be obtained after the
Closing in order for the Surviving Corporation to operate the Domestic
Institution and Foreign Institutions as they are currently operated and for
the Domestic Institution and Foreign Institutions to participate in all of
the Student Financial Assistance Programs, including the Title IV Programs,
under the ownership of the Surviving Corporation (collectively, the " _Post-
Closing Education Consents_ ", identified as such in Section 7.2(e)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter); provided, however, that the Company
(including any of its Subsidiaries) shall not file any application, notice or
other submission to the DOE, any Education Department or any Accrediting Body
without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review such application,
notice or other submission and without obtaining the consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, further,
however, that the Company shall be solely responsible for the submission of
all such applications, notices and submissions, subject only to the right of
Parent and Merger Sub to review and consent to such applications, notices and
submissions as provided for in this Section 7.2(e). Parent and Merger Sub
will take all commercially reasonable steps, including with respect to the
structure and organization of Parent and Merger Sub, to ensure that
any response from the DOE to the DOE pre-acquisition approval does not
contain any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(d).

  

### (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with
respect to the Merger, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such
Person, other than standard Governmental application, filing or registration
fees, and (ii) no party or its Affiliates shall be required to pay or commit
to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash
or other consideration, make any commitment or to incur any liability or
other obligation (provided, however, that such party shall give the other
parties hereto the opportunity to make such payments).

Section 7.3 _ _Access to Information__. (a)  Subject to applicable Law,
the Company will provide and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to provide Parent and Merger Sub and their
respective authorized Representatives, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice (i) such access to the offices, properties, books
and records of the Company and such Subsidiaries (so long as such access does
not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company) as Parent or
Merger Sub reasonably may request and (ii) all documents that Parent or
Merger Sub reasonably may request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent,
Merger Sub and their Representatives shall not have access to any books,
records, documents and other information (i) to the extent that such books,
records, documents or other information are subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party (provided that the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers under such agreements or
implement requisite procedures to enable reasonable access without violating
such agreement), (ii) to the extent that the disclosure thereof would result
in the loss of attorney-client privilege, (iii) to the extent required by
applicable Law (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enable the provision of reasonable access without violating such
law) or (iv) to the extent relating to pricing or other matters that are
highly sensitive if the exchange of such books, records, documents or other
information (or portions thereof), as reasonably determined by the Companys
counsel, would be reasonably likely to result in antitrust difficulties for
the Company (or any of its Affiliates). The parties will make appropriate
substitute arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section
7.3(a) shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreements and the Sterling
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

### (b) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective
Representatives shall affect the representations or warranties of the other
set forth herein.

contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and
continuing until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on March 14, 2007 (the " _No-Shop

officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents, advisors, affiliates and
other representatives (" _Representatives_ ") shall have the right (acting
under the direction of the Special Committee) to: (i) initiate, solicit and
encourage, whether publicly or otherwise, Company Acquisition Proposals (as
hereinafter defined), including by way of providing access to non-public
information pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreements (as hereinafter defined); _provided_  that the
Company shall promptly provide to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-
public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that
is provided to any Person given such access which was not previously provided
to Parent and Merger Sub; and (ii) enter into and maintain discussions or
negotiations with respect to Company Acquisition Proposals or otherwise
cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, discussions or negotiations or the making of any Company
Acquisition Proposal.

  

### (b) Subject to Section 7.4(c), from the No-Shop Period Start Date until
the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article IX, none of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries
nor any of their respective Representatives 

        

shall, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit or encourage (including
by way of providing information) the submission of any inquiries, proposals
or offers that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Company Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations
with respect thereto or otherwise knowingly cooperate with or knowingly
assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, discussions or negotiations (including by exempting any Person
from any applicable Takeover Statute), or (B) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, a Company Acquisition Proposal or enter into
any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share
purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement,
option agreement or other similar agreement providing for or relating to a
Company Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in
principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder or
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Subject to Section 7.4(c) and
except with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal received prior to the
No-Shop Period Start Date with respect to which the requirements of Section
7.4(c) have been satisfied as of the No-Shop Period Start Date (an "
_Excluded Party_ ") ( _provided_ , that any Excluded Party shall cease to be
an Excluded Party for all purposes under this Agreement at such time as the
Company Acquisition Proposal made by such party fails, in the reasonable
judgment of the Special Committee, to satisfy the requirements of Section
7.4(c)), on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion
or negotiation with any Persons conducted theretofore by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Representatives with respect to any Company Acquisition
Proposal and shall use its (and will cause its Representatives to use their)
reasonable best efforts to require the other parties thereto to promptly
return or destroy in accordance with the terms of such agreement any
confidential information previously furnished by the Company, the Companys
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives thereunder. Within 24 hours
of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent of the
number of Excluded Parties.

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.4(b),
if at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining
the Requisite Stockholder Vote, (i) the Company has received a written
Company Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Board of Directors
of the Company (acting through the Special Committee, if such committee still
exists, or otherwise by resolution of a majority of its Disinterested
Directors) believes in good faith to be bona fide and (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee, if such
committee still exists, or otherwise by resolution of a majority of its
Disinterested Directors) determines in good faith, after consultation with
its independent financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (A) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company (x) will not, and
will not allow Company Representatives to, disclose any non-public
information to such Person without entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) will promptly provide to Parent and Merger
Sub any material non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries provided to such other Person which was not previously provided
to Parent and Merger Sub. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in Section 7.4(b) or this Section 7.4(c), the

        

Company shall be permitted prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote
to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) above with respect to
any Excluded Party. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company
shall promptly (within one Business Day) notify Parent and Merger Sub in the
event it receives a Company Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group of
related Persons (other than, prior to the 15th calendar day following the No-
Shop Period Start Date, an Excluded Party), including the material terms and
conditions thereof and the identity of the party making such proposal or
inquiry, and shall keep Parent and Merger Sub reasonably apprised as to the
status and any material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning
the same. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the No-Shop Period
Start Date, the Company shall promptly (within one Business Day) notify
Parent and Merger Sub orally and in writing if it determines to begin
providing information or to engage in negotiations concerning a Company
Acquisition Proposal received on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date from
a Person or group of related Persons (other than, prior to the 15th calendar
day following the No-Shop Period Start Date, an Excluded Party).

  

### (d) Subject to Section 7.4(e), neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (i) withdraw
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
Recommendation or (ii) take any other action or make any other public
statement in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting inconsistent
with such Recommendation. None of the Board of Directors of the Company, any
committee thereof or the Company itself, shall agree with any Person (other
than an Excluded Party with respect to the period prior to the 15th calendar
day following the No-Shop Period Start Date) to limit or not to give prior
notice to Parent and Merger Sub of its intention to effect a Recommendation
Withdrawal or to terminate this Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at
any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote, the Company
receives a Company Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of the
Company (acting through the Special Committee, if such committee still
exists, or otherwise by resolution of a majority of its Disinterested
Directors) concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board
of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee, if such
committee still exists, or otherwise by resolution of a majority of its
Disinterested Directors) may withdraw or modify its Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub (" _Recommendation Withdrawal_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting
through the Special Committee, if such committee still exists, or otherwise
by resolution of a majority of its Disinterested Directors) may not effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to this Section 7.4(e) unless: (i) if such
action is taken from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date (or with respect
to an Excluded Party, from and after the 15th calendar day following the No-
Shop Period Start Date), the Company has provided prior written notice to
Parent and Merger Sub, at least five calendar days in advance (the " _Notice
Period_ "), of its intention to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal in
response to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of
the party making such Superior Proposal), and has contemporaneously provided
a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Superior Proposal and other material documents; and (ii) if such action
is taken from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date (or with respect to an
Excluded Party, from and after the 15th calendar day following the

        

No-Shop Period Start Date), prior to effecting such Recommendation
Withdrawal, the Company has, and has caused its financial and legal advisors
to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good
faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Company Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the
event of any material revisions to the applicable Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and
Merger Sub and to comply with the requirements of this Section 7.4(e) with
respect to such new written notice (to the extent so required), except that
the Notice Period shall be reduced to three Business Days.

  

### (f) Nothing contained in this Section 7.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors (acting
through the Special Committee, if such committee still exists, or otherwise
by resolution of a majority of its Disinterested Directors), after receipt of
advice from its outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with disclosure requirements under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
any such disclosure made pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) (other than a "stop,
look and listen" letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Recommendation
Withdrawal unless the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the
Special Committee, if such committee still exists) expressly reaffirms in
such disclosure its recommendation in favor of the approval of this
Agreement.

  

### (g) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 7.4 by any Representative of the Company or any of

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall to

expenses) (i) the present and former officers and directors thereof against

expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or

with any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the
Effective Time to the extent provided under the Companys or such

after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained in effect the current policies of officers and directors
liability insurance maintained on the date hereof by the Company and its
respective Subsidiaries (the " _Current Policies_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_
, that the Surviving Corporation may, and in the event of the cancellation or
termination of such policies shall, substitute therefor policies with

_however_ , that in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Parent

coverage prior to the Closing.

  

### (b) This Section 7.5 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present or
former directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their
respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the
Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. In the event that the

conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person

### (c) The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to
be exclusive of any other rights to which any such present or former director
or officer is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors
and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this Section 7.5 is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims under any such policies.

  

Section 7.6 _ _Takeover Statutes_._ The parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (i) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any such Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action
necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

Section 7.7 _ _Public Announcements_._ Except with respect to any
Recommendation Withdrawal or any action taken by the Company or its Board of
Directors pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 7.4, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, the parties will consult with each other before
issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press
release or public statement as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or any listing agreement with the Nasdaq

        

Global Select Market, will not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the consent of the other parties (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

Section 7.8 _ _Employee Matters__.

  

### (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time ("
_Current Employee_ ") may have under any Company Benefit Plan, Employment
Agreement or collective bargaining agreement, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to
maintain for each Current Employee (i) base salary or hourly wage rate,
target cash bonus opportunities under annual programs and commissions, but
excluding equity and equity equivalents (collectively, " _Compensation_ "),
that in the aggregate is no less favorable than, and (ii) severance, pension
and welfare benefits that in the aggregate are no less favorable than, in the
case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Compensation and benefits
maintained for and provided to such Current Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, subject to the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.8, nothing herein shall (A) prevent the amendment
or termination of any Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their
respective terms, or (B) interfere with the Surviving Corporations right
or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with
applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 7.8 shall limit the right of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the
employment of any Current Employee at any time in a manner consistent with
any applicable contractual obligations and any applicable employee benefit
plans. The provisions in this Section 7.8(a) are in addition to any effect
Section 7.8(c) may have on Compensation and benefits.

  

### (b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give each Current Employee full credit for purposes
of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit accrual
purposes, except for purposes of vacation and severance) under any Employee
Benefit Plans and any other employee compensation and incentive plans,
benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements, in
each case maintained for the benefit of Current Employees as of and after the
Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation
(each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") for such Current Employees service prior to the
Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their predecessor
entities, to the same extent such service is recognized by the Company or its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time except to the extent
such credit would result in an unintended duplication of benefits. With
respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent or its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to
be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations or exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements with respect to the Current Employees and
their eligible dependents to the extent waived under any Company Benefit Plan
and (ii) give effect, for the year in which the Closing occurs, for purposes
of satisfying any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to the
extent credited under any Company Benefit Plan, to claims incurred and
amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Current Employees and their
eligible dependents under similar plans maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in which such Current Employees and their eligible dependents
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        

### (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and all of their Subsidiaries to assume and honor, in accordance
with their respective terms, (i) each employment, change in control,
severance and termination plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any officer, director or
employee of that company, on the other hand and (ii) each deferred
compensation and bonus plan, program or agreement in the case of each of the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent listed on Section 7.8 of the
Company Disclosure Letter and legally binding on the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, with appropriate adjustments to reflect the effects of
the Merger.

  

### (d) During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending
on the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to
amend the Companys 2006 Executive Annual Incentive Plan to delete Section 8
of such plan.

  

### (e) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any Company Employees), other than the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 7.8) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement nor shall any provision of this Section 7.8 constitute an amendment
or modification of any of the Company Benefit Plans.

  

Section 7.9 _ _Financing__. (a)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives, including
legal and accounting, to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Financing and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) participation in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and

Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters, customary authorization letters
included in such syndication memoranda containing customary representations
regarding the information about the Company and its Subsidiaries included in
such memoranda, and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any
materials relating to the Debt Financing) or otherwise reasonably

the Effective Time, (iv) furnishing Parent and its Financing sources as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than 25 Business Days prior
to the End Date with financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including all financial
statements and financial data of the type required by Regulation S-X and
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of type and form customarily
included in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act,
including audits thereof to the extent so required, to consummate the
offering of debt securities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments at
the time in the Companys fiscal year that

        

such offering will be made, (v) using reasonable best efforts to obtain
accountants comfort letters and legal opinions as reasonably requested by
Parent, (vi) using its commercially reasonable efforts to provide monthly
financial statements (excluding footnotes) within 25 days of the end of each
month prior to the Closing Date, (vii) taking all actions reasonably
necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the Financing to
evaluate the Companys current assets, cash management and accounting
systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of
establishing collateral arrangements and (B) effective on or after the
Effective Time, establish bank and other accounts and blocked account
agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing, (viii)
taking all other corporate actions reasonably necessary to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be
made available to the Company (it being understood that (A) to the greatest
extent practicable, the actions contemplated by this Section 7.9(a)(viii)
shall not be required to be taken until immediately prior to the Closing and
that prior to the taking of such actions, any current member of the Board of
Directors may resign and (B) if such member of the Board of Directors
resigns, the failure of any such director to take any such action shall not
constitute a failure to satisfy a condition to Closing) and (ix) entering
into one or more credit or other agreements on terms satisfactory to Parent
in connection with the Debt Financing immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse, or cause
its Affiliates to reimburse, the Company for all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection
with such cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for and against any and all
losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than information provided by the Company or the Subsidiaries). The Company
hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection
with the Debt Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or the reputation or goodwill of the Company and its marks.  All
non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives pursuant to this
Section 7.9(a) shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreements, except for such information contained in
any offering memoranda referred to above and consented to by the Company
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

### (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect
thereto and (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Parent or Merger Sub in such definitive agreements that are within its
control. Subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Parent) of the conditions
set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons
providing such Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate the
Merger on or prior to the End Date (including by taking enforcement action to
cause such lenders and other Persons providing such Financing to fund such
Financing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (a) all or any
portion of the Debt Financing structured as high yield financing has not been
consummated, (b) all closing conditions contained in Article VIII (other
than, solely as a result of the failure to consummate all or any portion of
such high yield financing, those contained in Section 8.2(c)) shall have been
satisfied or waived and (c) the

        

### bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments
are available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Financing Commitments, then Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the proceeds of
such bridge financing, subject to the availability thereof, to be used to
replace such high yield financing no later than the final day of the
Marketing Period or, if earlier, the End Date. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the period of 20 consecutive
calendar days after the date the conditions set forth in clauses (a), (b) and
(c) of the immediately preceding sentence are satisfied and during which
period (x) such conditions remain satisfied and (y) all of the information
described in clause (iv) of the first sentence of Section 7.9(a) is and
remains available; provided, that if the Marketing Period has not ended on or
prior to August 17, 2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than
September 2, 2007. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing
Commitments, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources
on terms no less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the
Company reasonably apprised of material developments relating to
the Financing.

  

### (c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other material
provision under the Financing Commitments without the consent of the Company
if such amendments, modifications or waivers would impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise amend, modify or waive any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Financing in a manner that would be reasonably likely to cause
any material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, one or more
Debt Financing Commitments may be superseded at the option of Parent and
Merger Sub after the Execution Date but prior to the Effective Time by new
debt financing commitments (the " _New Financing Commitments_ ") which
replace existing Debt Financing Commitments; _provided_ , that the terms of
the New Financing Commitments shall not (A) impose new or additional
conditions to the receipt of the Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitments in any material respect or (B) be reasonably likely to cause any
material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII. In such event, the term " _Financing Commitments_ " as used herein
shall be deemed to include the Financing Commitments that are not so
superseded at the time in question and the New Financing Commitments to the
extent then in effect.

  

### (d) In no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates (which for purposes
of this Section 7.9(d) shall be deemed to include each direct or indirect
investor or potential investor in Parent, or any of Parents or any such
investors financing sources or potential financing sources or other
Representatives) (i) award any agent, broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other firm or Person except Goldman, Sachs and Co. and Citigroup any
financial advisory role on an exclusive basis (or until the No-Shop Period
Start Date, any additional firm or Person, other than J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc. and/or Credit Suisse, on a non-exclusive basis), or (ii) engage any bank
or investment bank or other provider of financing on an exclusive basis (or
otherwise on terms that could reasonably be expected to prevent such provider
from providing or seeking to provide financing to any third party in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries),
provided that this clause (ii) shall not prevent Parent or any of its
Affiliates from engaging (x) appropriate Affiliates of J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc. and/or Credit Suisse as a 

        

### provider of debt financing on a non-exclusive basis, or (y) any of
the potential providers of mezzanine financing set forth in Section 7.9(d) of
the Parent Disclosure Letter, in such capacity and on a non-exclusive basis,
in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that following the No-Shop Period Start Date, Parent may engage one
additional provider of debt financing and one additional financial advisor,
in each case, on an exclusive basis, and such other financial advisors and
providers of financing, on a non-exclusive basis, as determined by Parent.
Until the No-Shop Period Start Date, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall seek or obtain, or engage in substantive discussions in respect of, any
equity commitments or equity financing in respect of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, or provide any information in respect
thereof to any potential investor in Parent, or any of Parents or any such
investors financing sources or potential financing sources or other
Representatives who have not been provided any such information prior to the
Execution Date, other than (A) as set forth in the Equity Financing
Commitments, as in effect on the date hereof, (B) the Persons listed in
Section 7.9(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter and (C) sources other than
Persons principally involved in the private equity business, subject in the
case of this clause (C) to a maximum aggregate equity commitment of
$250,000,000.

behalf of its Affiliates and each investor in Parent party to any
Confidentiality Agreement or the confidentiality agreement dated September
12, 2006, between Sterling and the Company (the " _Sterling Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") that such Affiliates and investors continue to be bound by such
Confidentiality Agreements (including any "standstill" provisions therein),
and the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not in
any manner modify or limit the Companys or such Affiliates rights under
such agreements, except that each of the Confidentiality Agreements and the
Sterling Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to allow (x)
the taking of any action permitted by this Agreement, including the formation
of a "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act)
with such equity financing sources as are permitted by Section 7.9, the
acquisition by each member of any such group of beneficial ownership of
securities of the Company held by all other group members, and the making of
any necessary filings with respect to the formation of, and beneficial
ownership of voting securities of the Company by the members of, such a group
and (y) to permit Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates to make
"solicitations" of "proxies" to vote (as such terms are used in Regulation
14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) in favor of the approval of the
Merger.

  

Section 7.11 _ _ _ _Management__ _._ In no event shall Parent or any of its
Affiliates (which for purposes of this Section shall be deemed to include
each direct investor in Parent) enter into any arrangements that are
effective prior to the Closing with any member of the Companys management or
any other Company Employee on terms that expressly prohibit or restrict such
member of management or such Company Employee from discussing, negotiating or
entering into any arrangements with any third party in connection with a
transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or seek to do so.
Parent shall cause its Affiliates to comply with the foregoing covenant.

Time, the Company will cause each Member of its Board of Directors to execute
and deliver a letter, which will not be revoked

this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other orally and in writing of (i) the occurrence, or
non-occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party
to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied or (ii) the failure of such party to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; provided, however, that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.13 shall not cure any
breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter

needs, and such other actions taken in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice; (B) pledge or otherwise encumber shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of the Company or any of its

Parent).

  

(d) __Education Consents__. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Domestic
Institution shall have received a written response from the DOE to the pre-
acquisition review application filed with respect to the Domestic Institution

Effect on the Company, or (ii) any requirement that any partner or member of
Parent or any Affiliate of any such partner or member assume any liability
for obligations arising out of the Companys or the Domestic Institutions
participation in or administration of the Title IV Programs (provided that

the satisfaction or valid waiver of the following further conditions:

# ARTICLE IX 
  _TERMINATION_

  

Section 9.1 _ _Termination_._ This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time

### (a) by mutual written consent of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand;

   

50   

   

### (b) by either the Company or Parent:

  

#### (i) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before September
21, 2007 (the " _End Date_ ") unless the failure of the Effective Time to
occur by such date is principally the result of, or caused by, the failure of
the party seeking to exercise such termination right to perform or observe
any of the covenants or agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement;

  

#### (ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 8.1(c)
shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_
, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose breach of
any provision of this Agreement is the principal cause of or resulted in
the application or imposition of such Restraint; or

  

#### (iii) if at the Company Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment thereof
at which this Agreement has been voted upon, the Company stockholders fail to
approve this Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder Vote;

  

### (c) by the Company:

  

#### (i)  if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred which would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(c)
or Sections 8.3(a) or (b) not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable
of being cured by the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company is
not then in material breach of this Agreement;

  

#### (ii) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Requisite Stockholder Vote, the Company receives a Company Acquisition
Proposal and the Board of Directors (acting through the Special Committee if
such committee still exists, or otherwise by resolution of a majority of its
Disinterested Directors) shall have concluded in good faith that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause unless: (A) the Company, if such action is taken from or
after the No-Shop Period Start Date (or with respect to an Excluded Party,
from and after the 15th calendar day following the No-Shop Period Start
Date), shall also have complied with the proviso to the first sentence
of Section 7.4(e), reading, for purposes of this Section 9.1(c)(ii), the
proviso to the first sentence of Section 7.4(e) as if the words "effect
a Recommendation Withdrawal" were replaced with the words "terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii)"and clause (ii) of the proviso
to Section 7.4(e) as if the words "effecting such Recommendation Withdrawal"
were replaced with the words "terminating this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(c)(ii)," (B) the Company concurrently pays the Termination Fee
payable pursuant to Section 9.2(a); and (C) the Board of Directors of the
Company concurrently approves, and the Company concurrently enters into, a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; or

  

#### (iii) at any time prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Cooperation Agreement is breached in a manner that materially impairs the
Companys ability to take the actions described in Section 7.4(a) of
this Agreement, and the breaching party has been

        

#### given reasonable notice of such breach and a reasonable opportunity to
cure such breach prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date;

  

### (d) by Parent or Merger Sub:

  

#### (i) if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred
which would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) or (b)
not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured by the End
Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in
material breach of this Agreement;

  

#### (ii) prior to the obtaining of the Requisite Stockholder Vote, if the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof (A) shall have
effected a Recommendation Withdrawal, been deemed to have effected a
Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to Section 7.4(f) or publicly proposed to
effect a Recommendation Withdrawal, or (B) shall have approved or recommended
to the stockholders of the Company a Company Acquisition Proposal other than
the Merger, or shall have resolved or publicly announced its intent to effect
the foregoing; or

  

#### (iii) the Company shall have willfully and materially breached the first
sentence of Section 7.4(d) or the proviso in Section 7.4(f) in any respect
adverse to Parent and Merger Sub.

  

Section 9.2 _ _ _ _Termination Awards__. (a) In the event that this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) or by
Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii)(B) or Section

or Section 9.1(d)(iii).

  

### (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Merger
Sub pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii)(A) and, at any time after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the event giving rise to Parents or Merger Subs
right to terminate this Agreement under Section 9.1(d)(ii)(A), a Company
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
otherwise communicated or made known to any executive officer or director of
the Company (or any person shall have publicly announced, or communicated or

Company Acquisition Proposal), then the Company shall pay as directed by
Parent in writing the Termination Fee as promptly as possible (but in any
event within four Business Days) following termination of this Agreement.

  

### (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Merger
Sub, on one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, pursuant to Section
9.1(b)(iii) (or could have been terminated under such section) under
circumstances in which the obligations under the Voting Agreement to vote in
favor of the Merger Agreement have been satisfied in all material
respects, and, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Company Stockholder Meeting, a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or otherwise

        

### communicated or made known to any executive officer or director of the
Company (or any person shall have publicly announced, or communicated or made
known a bona fide intention, whether or not conditional, to make a Company
Acquisition Proposal) prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, and, if
within 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same as
that originally announced or consummated), then the Company shall pay as
directed by Parent in writing the Termination Fee, less the amount of any
Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent by the Company, on the date of such
execution or consummation ( _provided_ that solely for purposes of this
Section 9.2(c), the term "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning set forth in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal
contained in Section 7.4 except that all references to 30% shall be deemed to
be references to 50%).

  

### (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Merger
Sub, on one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, pursuant to Section
9.1(b)(iii) (or could have been terminated under such section) under
circumstances in which (i) the obligations under the Voting Agreement to vote
in favor of the Merger Agreement have been satisfied in all material respects
and (ii) the Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to this Section
9.2, then the Company shall pay as directed by Parent in writing as promptly
as possible (but in any event within four Business Days) following receipt of
an invoice therefor all of Parents and Merger Subs actual and reasonably
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) actually incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount shall not
be greater than $15,000,000 (" _Parent Expenses_ "); _provided_ that the
existence of circumstances which could require the Termination Fee
subsequently to become payable pursuant to Section 9.2(c) shall not relieve
the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this
Section 9.2(d); and _provided,_ _further_  that the payment by the Company of
Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 9.2(d) shall not relieve the Company
of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section
9.2(c) except to the extent indicated in such Section 9.2(c).

  

### (e) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section 9.2(a), 9.2(b),
9.2(c) or 9.2(d) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the recipient of such amount.

  

### (f) The Company, on one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that
without these agreements the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not have
entered into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 9.2 do not constitute a penalty. If any amounts due pursuant to this
Section 9.2 are not paid within the time periods specified in this Section
9.2, the party that fails to make such payment shall pay the costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the
recipient party in connection with any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period
as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from
the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual
payment.

        

Section 9.3 _ _ _ _Effect of Termination__ _._ If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates hereunder, except (i) Sections 7.3(a)(last sentence), 7.10, 7.11,
9.2, 9.3, 10.1, 10.3, 10.6, 10.11 and 10.13 will survive the termination
hereof and (ii) with respect to any liabilities for Damages incurred or
suffered as a result of the willful and material breach by any other party of

forth in this Agreement.

telecopy is transmitted to the facsimile number specified above and
electronic confirmation of transmission is received or (ii) if given by any
other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section 10.1.

  

Section 10.2 _ _ _ _Survival of Representations and Warranties__ _._  None
of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive the Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements
contained herein and therein which by their terms apply in whole or in part

Section 10.3 _ _ _ _Expenses__ _._ Except as otherwise expressly provided
in Sections 7.9 and 9.2, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

  

Section 10.4 _ _ _ _Amendment__ _._ This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of
Directors (in the case of the Company, acting through the Special Committee,
if such committee still exists, or otherwise by resolution of a majority of
its Disinterested Directors) at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether

Maryland Law requires the further approval of the stockholders of the Company
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

  

Section 10.5 _ _ _ _Waiver__ _._ At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the

previously authorized by the Special Committee, or otherwise such action
shall be taken by resolution of a majority of its Disinterested Directors.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of
any party to assert any rights or remedies shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights or remedies.

  

Section 10.6 _ _ _ _Successors and Assigns__ _._  The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, provided that no party
may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto (and any
purported assignment without such consent shall be void and without effect),
except that Parent may assign all or any of its rights and obligations
hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning
party of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may
assign its rights and obligations to any entity identified by Parent (or
cause Parent to be removed as a party to this Agreement, in which case Merger
Sub and the Company shall be the only parties to this Agreement and Merger
Sub shall assume the obligations of Parent hereunder) on or prior to the 21st
Business Day from the date hereof (or thereafter, subject to Section 10.4, if
required to comply with the last sentence of Section 7.2(e)); provided (i)

ability of the Company to satisfy the condition in Section 8.2(d), (ii) any
assignee of Parent (or if Parent is removed as a party to this Agreement,
Merger Sub) has beneficial equity ownership consistent with that of Parent
and (iii) any such assignment does not adversely affect the validity or
enforceability of the Financing Commitments; and provided, further, that any
such assignment or removal shall relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder.
The parties shall cooperate in good faith to modify the terms of this
Agreement to reflect such assignment or removal.

by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland.

  

Section 10.8 _ _ _ _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries__
_._  This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signatures and in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective only when actually signed by each party
hereto and each such party has received counterparts hereof signed by all of
the other parties hereto. No provision of this Agreement is intended to or
shall confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder or with respect hereto, except as otherwise expressly
provided in Section 7.5. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
following the Effective Time the provisions of Article II shall be
enforceable by holders of Common Stock or Company Equity Awards.

  

Section 10.9 _ _ _ _Severability__ _._  If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue
of any Law, or due to any public policy, all other conditions and provisions
of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so

        

long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

Section 10.10 _ _ _ _Entire Agreement__ _._  This Agreement, together with
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Cooperation Agreement and the Voting
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect
to its subject matter and supersedes all oral or written prior or
contemporaneous agreements and understandings among the parties with respect
to such subject matter. None of the parties shall be liable or bound to any
other party in any manner by any representations, warranties or covenants
relating to such subject matter hereof except as specifically set forth
herein, in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Cooperation Agreement or the
Voting Agreement.

  

## Section 10.11 _ _ _ _Jurisdiction__.

  

### (a) Each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of (i) any
Maryland State court, and (ii) any Federal court of the United States sitting
in the State of Maryland, solely for the purposes of any suit, action or
other proceeding between any of the parties hereto arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each party agrees
to commence any suit, action or proceeding relating hereto either in any
Federal court of the United States sitting in the State of Maryland or, if
such suit, action or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for
reasons of subject matter jurisdiction, in any Maryland State court. Each
party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any suit, action or proceeding between any of the parties hereto
arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby in (i)
any Maryland State court, and (ii) any Federal court of the United States
sitting in the State of Maryland, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party further irrevocably consents to
the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such
suit, action or other proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by
registered mail to such party at its address set forth in this Agreement,
such service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of
such registered mail; provided that nothing in this Section 10.11 shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law. The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 10.11
shall not constitute a general consent to service of process in the State of
Maryland and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this
Section 10.11. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such suit,
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

  

### (b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH
MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION

        

### DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III)
EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.11.

  

Section 10.12 _ _ _ _Authorship__ _._ The parties agree that the terms and
language of this Agreement were the result of negotiations between the
parties and their respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no
presumption that any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against
any party. Any controversy over construction of this Agreement shall
be decided without regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

  

## Section 10.13 _ _Remedies__. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement (including Section 9.2 and Section 9.3), the parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, damages would be difficult
to determine and would be an insufficient remedy and no other adequate
remedy would exist at law or in equity, in each case in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached (or any party hereto
threatens such a breach). It is accordingly agreed that in the event of a
breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the other parties hereto shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. Each party hereto irrevocably waives any defenses based on
adequacy of any other remedy, whether at law or in equity, that might be
asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance of any of the terms
or provisions hereof or injunctive relief in any action brought therefor by
any other party hereto.

  

[signature page follows]

        

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized signatories as of the day and year
first written above.
