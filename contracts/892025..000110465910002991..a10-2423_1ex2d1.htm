operations for purposes of the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust or
competition Law prior to the expiration or termination of any applicable HSR
Act waiting period or any other applicable antitrust or competition Law
waiting period, or prior to receipt of any applicable approval under any
antitrust or competition Law, and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, no consent of Parent will be required
with respect to any matter set forth in the Agreement to the extent the
requirement of such consent would violate any applicable Law.

  



  

## Section 6.3. _Access to Information_. Until the Closing Date, the Company
shall allow Parent and its agents and representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours upon reasonable notice to the books, records,
representatives and management of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall
use reasonable commercial efforts to facilitate discussions or meetings
between Parent and management personnel of the suppliers,

  



        
   

  



  

## brokers and customers identified on **Schedule 6.3** of the
Parent Disclosure Schedules. All such access shall be subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, as soon as reasonably available after the end of each
monthly accounting period of the Company and its Subsidiaries ending after
November 30, 2009, the Company use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
to Parent true and complete copies of the Companys unaudited consolidated
balance sheet as of such period end, and the related unaudited consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows for the period then ended and on a
year-to-date basis, which shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
Interim Financial Statements (other than to account for changes in GAAP) and
the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

## 

  

## Section 6.4. _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. The Company will use
its reasonable commercial efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all the

## 

  

### (a) From the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to **Section 10.1**, the Company agrees that it will not, and will not
permit any of its officers, management committee members, affiliates,
members, employees, agents, or other persons acting on its behalf to,
directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage, consider, discuss,
respond to, or accept any inquiry, proposal or offer from any third party
(other than Parent and its agents) relating to: (a) the acquisition of all
or substantially all of the assets or business of the

  



        
   

  



  

### Company or any Subsidiary; (b) the acquisition of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, any equity interests of the Company or any Subsidiary;
(c) the merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving the
Company or any Subsidiary; (d) the liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of
the Company or any Subsidiary; (e) any other transaction or series of
transactions having an effect or purpose comparable to any of the foregoing
(any of the foregoing, an " ** _Acquisition Proposal_** ").  The Company
shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours): (i) notify Parent
in the event that the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective officers, directors or advisors, receives an Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) disclose to Parent the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
(including the identity of each third party); and (iii) take all actions with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal as Parent may reasonably request. The
Company will, and will cause the other persons listed in the first sentence
of this **Section 6.5** to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
discussions and negotiations, if any, that have taken place prior to the date
hereof with any parties with respect to any such matters.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this **Section
6.5** shall prevent the Company from entering into discussions or
negotiations with any Person or entity in connection with a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal received from such Person that the management committee
of the Company determines in good faith could lead to a Superior Proposal.
**** If the management committee of the Company shall determine that an
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the Company shall notify Parent
in writing of such determination. In the event that the Company receives
an Acquisition Proposal and the management committee of the Company
determines in good faith that it has a fiduciary duty to withdraw its
recommendation that the members of the Company approve the Merger and the

  



        
   

  



  

### transactions contemplated hereby, nothing herein shall restrict or
prevent the management committee from withdrawing such recommendation, nor
shall the Company be in breach of any provision of this Agreement as a result
of such withdrawal.  The provisions of this **Section 6.5(b)
**shall terminate upon the receipt of the requisite member approval of this
Agreement and the Merger.

  

### 

  

### (c) For purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Superior Proposal_** " means
any bona fide Acquisition Proposal on terms that the management committee of
the Company determines in its good faith judgment are more favorable to the
Companys members than this Agreement and the Merger.

  

### 

  

## Section 6.6. _Financial Statements Preparation_. The Company shall,
together with its respective independent auditors, promptly initiate the
preparation of (i) audited consolidated financial statements (consolidated
balance sheet, statement of operations, statement of consolidated changes in

a basis consistent with the GAAP and Rule 3.05 of Regulation S-X,
together with an executed, unqualified opinion of Deloitte and Touche LLP; and
(ii) unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2009

assist Parent in the preparation by Parent and its independent accountants of
any pro forma financial statements required to be filed by Parent under Form
8-K and Regulation S-X, facilitate the review of any Company audit or review
work papers, including the examination of selected interim financial
statements and

  



        
   

  



  

## data, and deliver such customary representations as may be reasonably
requested by Parents independent accountants. Any cost or expense incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the actions required
to be taken by them or their auditors related to the actions described in
this **Section 6.6** shall be solely at the expense of Parent.

## Section 7.1. _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Parent and Merger
Sub will use their reasonable commercial efforts to satisfy or cause to be
satisfied all the conditions precedent that are set forth in **Sections 9.1**

## 

  

## Section 7.2. _Employees; Employees Benefit Plans_. **** Parent or its
Affiliates will employ or continue to employ each employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (the " ** _Employees_** "). For a period
of not less than twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to the Employees base salary or hourly wage
rates (as the case may be) of not less than the wage rates received by the
Employees as of the time immediately prior to the Closing. Any time or
times following the Closing Date as determined by Parent, Parent shall have
the right to integrate the Employees into the compensation, benefit and other
employment practices of Parent, from and after which time Parent shall
(subject to Parents commitment to maintain base salaries and hourly wage
rates for twelve (12) months following the Closing Date as provided in the
second sentence of this **Section 7.2**) provide such compensation and
benefits to the Employees as are substantially comparable, in the aggregate,
to similarly situated employees of Parent. Upon such

  



        
   

  



  

## integration, Parent shall (or shall cause an Affiliate to) make available
to Employees and their eligible dependents the employee benefits and
compensation plans, programs and arrangement that Parent generally provides
to its employees (the " ** _Parent Plans_** ") without limitations based upon
pre-existing conditions (and the amount of deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Employees prior to the Closing Date under the Employee
Plans shall be credited toward satisfaction of deductibles under the Parent
Plans). Upon such integration, the Parent Plans shall grant Employees full
credit for all service or employment with, or recognized by, the Company and
its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, participation, benefits and
vesting with respect to the Employer Plans that are comparable to the Parent
Plans as of the Closing Date.

  

## 

  

## Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, at any time during the
twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date, Parent or any of its
Affiliates takes any action (other than termination of employment) following
which the Employees are no longer eligible to participate in the Amerifit
Nutrition, Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plans as in effect on the date hereof
(the " ** _Amerifit 401(k) Plan_**"), then Parent or its Affiliates shall
either (i) make employer contributions on behalf of the Employees to a
comparable Parent Plan in an amount equal to any employer contributions that
the Employees would have been entitled to receive under the Amerifit 401(k)
Plan through the one year anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) increase
the base salary and wages payable to the Employees in an amount (on an after
tax basis) equal to any employer contributions that the Employee would have
been entitled to receive under the Amerifit 401(k) Plan through the one year
anniversary of the Closing Date. Parent shall (and shall cause its
Affiliates to) assume responsibility for the vacation time and sick leave
benefits due to the Employees as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
if applicable Law requires that Parent or any of its Affiliates provide
employee benefits to employees of Parent or any of its

  



        
   

  



  

## Affiliates that are not required under this **Section 7.2**, Parent hereby
agrees to provide (or cause to be provided) such mandatory benefits to the
Employees if and to the extent required by such applicable Law.
 Notwithstanding any provision of this **Section 7.2** to the contrary,
this **Section 7.2** shall not alter the "at will" employment status of the
Employees on and after the Closing Date or obligate Parent, the Company or
any Subsidiary to continue any Employees employment for any length of time.

  

## 

  

## Section 7.3. _Tax Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall timely file any Tax Returns
for the Company and its Subsidiaries with a filing due date (after giving
effect to all possible extensions) that is on or before the Closing Date.
Parent and the Former Securityholders agree that Parent will be responsible
for causing the Company to timely file all other Tax Returns for the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent or unless required by
applicable Law or GAAP, make any elections, change any annual accounting
period or adopt or change any accounting method, file any amended Tax Return,
enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment related
to the Company or any Subsidiary, surrender any right to claim a refund of
Taxes, or take other actions with respect to such Tax Returns or the payment
of any Tax if such action would have the effect of increasing the Tax
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any period ending
after the Closing Date or decreasing any Tax attribute of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries existing on the Closing Date.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Former
Securityholders shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys
request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any

a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.

# INDEMNIFICATION

  

# 

  

## Section 11.1. _Indemnification of Parent_. From and after the Closing and
subject to the limitations contained in this **Article XI**, the Former
Securityholders will, on a several (but not joint) basis, indemnify Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates
(collectively, the " ** _Parent_** _**Indemnified Parties**_ ") and hold the
Parent Indemnified Parties harmless against any actual loss, expense,
liability, obligation, cost or other damage, including reasonable attorneys
fees and costs of investigation (collectively, " ** _Damages_** ") that the
Parent Indemnified Parties have incurred by reason of or directly
attributable to (i) the inaccuracy or breach by the Company of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in **Article IV
**of this Agreement or in the certificate to be delivered to Parent pursuant
to **Section 9.2(c)**, (ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply
prior to the Closing with its covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement or in the certificate to

  



        
   

  



  

## be delivered to Parent pursuant to **Section 9.2(c)**, and (iii)
the matters disclosed and identified on **_Exhibit 11.1.1_** and **_Exhibit
11.1.2_**. All such calculations of Damages shall take into account any
offset benefits or insurance proceeds actually received by the Parent
Indemnified Parties in connection with the matter out of which such Damages
shall arise and shall take into account any Tax benefits that the Parent
Indemnified Parties actually receive in connection therewith, in each case,
if, when and to the extent such offset benefits, insurance proceeds or Tax
benefits are actually received by the Parent Indemnified Parties. The Parent
Indemnified Parties agree to use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such
offset benefits, insurance proceeds or Tax benefits. If an indemnification
payment is received by any Parent Indemnified Party, and such Parent
Indemnified Party later receives insurance proceeds, other third
party recoveries or Tax benefits in respect of the related Damages, such
Parent Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Securityholders Agent
(for the benefit of the Former Securityholders) such amount.
 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (a) subject to
the exceptions enumerated below in this **Section 11.1**, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to seek indemnification under this
**Section 11.1 **with respect to any Damages unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Damages suffered by the Parent Indemnified Parties exceeds in
the aggregate the Deductible and then the Parent Indemnified Parties shall
only be entitled to indemnification for such aggregate amount that exceeds
the Deductible; (b) subject to the exceptions enumerated below in this
**Section 11.1**, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be deemed to have
incurred any Damages unless the Damages arising from an individual claim
exceed (together with all other claims so substantially related as to
effectively constitute one claim) $50,000 (the " ** _De Minimis Amount_** ");
(c) subject to the exceptions enumerated below in this **Section
11.1**, the aggregate amount of all payments to which the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to receive under

  



        
   

  



  

## this **Section 11.1 **shall in no event exceed the Cap; and (d) the
Damages incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not include the
amount by which the items giving rise to such Damages were accounted for in
any of the adjustments to the Merger Consideration pursuant to **Sections
3.4** or **3.5**. The limitations set forth in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of
the immediately preceding sentence shall not be applicable to Damages
incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties to the extent relating to or
arising out of (w) the inaccuracy or breach by the Company of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in **Section 4.2(a)**,
**4.2(d) **or **4.3(a) **of this Agreement, (x) any failure by the Company
to perform or comply prior to the Closing with its covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, (y) the matters set forth in **_Exhibit
11.1.2_** or (z) claims based on fraud, and the limitations set forth in
clause (b) of the immediately preceding sentence shall not be applicable to
**_Exhibit 11.1.1_**. Other than in connection with indemnifying the Parent
Indemnified Parties from third party claims which seek punitive, special,
consequential, exemplary or incidental Damages, the Former Securityholders
shall not be liable for any punitive, special, consequential, exemplary or
incidental Damages. Other than with respect to claims based on fraud, under
no circumstances shall any Former Securityholder be liable under this
**Section 11.1** for more than the lesser of (x) its pro rata portion of the
amount of the Parent Indemnified Parties Damages, (y) the total amount of
the Merger Consideration received by it and (z) its pro rata portion of the
Cap.

## Section 11.2. _Indemnification of Former Securityholders_. From and after
the Closing and subject to the limitations contained in this **Article XI**,
Parent will indemnify the Former Securityholders and their respective
officers, directors, and Affiliates (collectively, the " **
_Securityholders Indemnified Parties_** ") and hold the Securityholders
Indemnified Parties harmless against any Damages that the Securityholders
Indemnified Parties

  



        
   

  



  

## have incurred by reason of or directly attributable to (i) the inaccuracy
or breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any representation or warranty of Parent
or Merger Sub contained in **Article V **of this Agreement or
the certificate to be delivered to the Company pursuant to **Section 9.3(d)
**or (ii) any failure by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company to
perform or comply with any of its covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of the Surviving
Company, this clause (iii) shall only be applicable to covenants or
agreements to be performed by the Surviving Company at or after the Effective
Time (" ** _Company Breach Claims_** "). All such calculations of Damages
shall take into account any offset benefits or insurance proceeds actually
received by the Securityholders Indemnified Parties in connection with the
matter out of which such Damages shall arise and shall take into account any
Tax benefits that the Securityholders Indemnified Parties actually receive in
connection therewith, in each case, if, when and to the extent such offset
benefits, insurance proceeds or Tax benefits are actually received by the
Securityholders Indemnified Parties. The Securityholders Indemnified Parties
agree to use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such offset benefits or
insurance proceeds.  If an indemnification payment is received by any
Securityholders Indemnified Party, and such Securityholders Indemnified Party
later receives insurance proceeds, other third party recoveries or Tax
benefits in respect of the related Damages, such Securityholders Indemnified
Party shall promptly pay to Parent such amount. The Damages incurred by the
Securityholders Indemnified Parties shall not include the amount by which the
items giving rise to such Damages were accounted for in any of the
adjustments to the Merger Consideration pursuant to **Sections 3.4** or
**3.5**. Other than in connection with indemnifying the Securityholders
Indemnified Parties from third party claims which seek punitive, special,
consequential or exemplary Damages,

  



         
 

  

## 

  

## Parent shall not be liable for any punitive, special, consequential,
exemplary or incidental Damages.

## Section 11.3. _Exclusive Remedies_. The parties agree that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or
otherwise, following the Closing, except with respect to (i) the adjustments
provided in **Section 3.4 **or **3.5** and (ii) claims based on fraud, the
indemnification provisions of this **Article XI** are the sole and exclusive
remedies of the parties pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. From and after the Closing, to the
maximum extent permitted by law, except with respect to (i) the
adjustments provided in **Section 3.4 **or **3.5** and (ii) claims based on
fraud, the parties hereby waive all other rights, claims, remedies or actions
with respect to any matter in any way relating to this Agreement or arising
in connection herewith, whether under any Laws. Except as provided in this
**Article XI**, from and after the Closing, except with respect to
claims based on fraud, no right, claim, remedy or action shall be brought
or maintained by any party, and no recourse shall be brought or granted
against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misstatement or
omission respecting an inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations
or warranties of any of the parties thereto set forth or contained in
this Agreement.

## Section 11.4. _Survival of Indemnification Obligations_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations
and warranties contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall survive
until the Survival Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the representations
and warranties contained in **Sections 4.2(a), 4.2(d) **and **4.3 (a) **and
**Section 5.2** shall survive indefinitely. Except with respect to claims
relating to

### 92   

     
   

  

### ** **

  

### **Sections 4.2(a), 4.2(d) **and  **4.3 (a) **and  **Section 5.2**,
and claims arising pursuant to **_Exhibit 11.1.1_** and **_Exhibit 11.1.2_**
(as to which survival is governed by the terms of the applicable Exhibits)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the last sentence of
**Section 11.5(a)**, no claim for indemnification may be made unless, on or
prior to the Survival Date, written notice has been duly given in accordance
with the terms of **Section 12.1**. ** **If written notice asserting any
claim for indemnification under **Article XI** shall have been given
in accordance herewith within the applicable survival period, the
representations and warranties that are the subject of such indemnification
claim shall survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim
is fully and finally resolved. The foregoing limitations on the survival of
the representations and warranties shall not apply in cases involving fraud.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Survival of Covenants and Agreements_. Each of the covenants and
agreements, including the indemnity obligations of the parties contained in,

notice of the claim for Damages (i) stating the aggregate amount of the
Damages or an estimate thereof, in each case to the extent known or
determinable at such time and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the
individual items of such Damages included in the amount so stated, the date
each such item was paid or properly accrued or arose, and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach or

  

### 

  

### 93   

     
   

  

### 

  

### claim to which such item is related. The failure of the indemnified party
to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party
of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have
adversely prejudiced the indemnifying partys ability to defend such claim.

  

### 

  

### (b) The respective obligations and liabilities of the parties to
indemnify pursuant to this **Article XI** in respect of any Damages arising
from a claim by a third party shall be subject to the following additional
terms and conditions:

  

### 

  

#### (i) The indemnifying party shall have the right to undertake, by counsel
or other representatives of its own choosing reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party, the defense, compromise, and settlement of such claim.

  

####

undertake such defense, or within thirty (30) days after notice of any such
claim from the indemnified party shall fail to defend, the indemnified party
(upon further written notice to the indemnifying party) shall have the right
to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim, by counsel
or other representatives of its own choosing, on behalf of and for the
account and risk of the indemnifying party.

  

####

(A) the indemnified party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense,
to participate in the defense, compromise or settlement of the claim (
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if there is a reasonable probability that a
claim may materially and adversely affect the indemnified party other than as
a result of money damages or other money payments, the costs of such
participation shall be borne by the indemnifying party), (B) the indemnifying
party shall

  

#### 

  

#### 94   

     
   

  

#### 

  

#### not, without the indemnified partys written consent, settle or
compromise any claim or consent to entry of any judgment which does not
include as a term thereof the giving by the claiming party or the plaintiff
to the indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such
claim and (C) in the event that the indemnifying party undertakes defense of
any claim, the indemnified party by counsel or other representative of its
own choosing and at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to
consult with the indemnifying party and its counsel or other representatives
concerning such claim and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party

satisfactory joint defense agreement.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) The indemnified party shall not, without the indemnifying partys
written consent, settle or compromise any claim or consent to entry of any
judgment.

  

#### 

  

### (c) If the Securityholders Agent or Parent shall object in writing to
any claim or claims by a Parent Indemnified Party or Securityholders
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, the Parent Indemnified Party or
Securityholders Agent, as the case may be, shall have thirty (30) days from

objection. If after such thirty (30) day period there remains a dispute as to
any claims, the Securityholders Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith
for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims.

  

### 

  

### (d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation,
either Parent or the Securityholders Agent may, by written notice to the
other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or
loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third

  

### 

  

### 95   

     
   

  

### 

  

### party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such
amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either
such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three
arbitrators.  Within fifteen (15) days after such written notice is sent,
Parent (on the one hand) and the Securityholders Agent (on the other hand)
shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall
select a third arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrators as to the
validity and amount of any made claim shall be solely decided in accordance
with the provisions of this **Article XI** and shall be binding and
conclusive.

  

### 

  

### (e) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in
New York, New York under the commercial rules then in effect of the

arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the
administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association, and the expenses,
including, without limitation, the reasonable attorneys fees and costs,
incurred by the prevailing party to the arbitration.

further act of any Former Securityholder, AB SR shall be appointed as agent
and attorney-in-fact (the " ** _Securityholders  Agent_**") for each Former
Securityholder (except holders of capital stock of Amerifit, if any, as shall
have perfected their appraisal or dissenters rights under the DGCL).
 Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this **Section 11.6(a)
**the Securityholders Agent shall have the authority to act for and on
behalf of the Former Securityholders, including, without limitation, to give
and receive notices and communications, to act on behalf of the

  

### 

  

### 96   

     
   

  

### 

  

### Former Securityholders with respect to the Escrow Account and any other
matters arising under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, to
authorize delivery to Parent of any funds and property in its possession or
in the possession of the Escrow Agent in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to
object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and commence, prosecute, participate in, settle, dismiss or
otherwise terminate, as applicable, lawsuits and claims, mediation and
arbitration proceedings, to retain funds which would otherwise be released to
the Former Securityholders from the Escrow Account for the purpose of funding
the costs of any such proceedings and to comply with orders of courts and
awards of courts, mediators and arbitrators with respect to such suits,
claims or proceedings, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Securityholders Agent for the accomplishment of the
foregoing. The Securityholders Agent shall for all purposes be deemed the
sole authorized agent of the Former Securityholders until such time as the
agency is terminated. Such agency may be changed by the Former
Securityholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Securityholders
Agent may not be removed unless holders of at least two-thirds interest in
the Merger Consideration agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted Securityholders Agent.  Any vacancy in the position of
Securityholders Agent may be filled by approval of the recipients of a
majority of the Merger Consideration. No bond shall be required of
the Securityholders Agent, and the Securityholders Agent shall not
receive compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from
the Securityholders Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Former Securityholders during the term of the agency. Material notices
or communications to the Securityholders Agent will be forwarded promptly to
each of the Former Securityholders.  Notwithstanding anything in this
**Section 11.6** to the contrary, the

  

### 

  

### 97   

     
   

  

### 

  

### Securityholders Agent may not: (i) accept service of process on
behalf of any Former Securityholder in its individual capacity; or (ii) take
any action on behalf of a Former Securityholder with respect to any claim
that may be asserted against such Former Securityholder in its individual
capacity, whether for alleged fraud or otherwise, unless it has received the
written consent of the Former Securityholder to take any such action.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Securityholders Agent shall not incur any liability with respect
to any action taken or suffered by it or omitted hereunder as
Securityholders Agent while acting in its capacity as Securityholders
Agent. The Securityholders Agent may, in all questions arising hereunder,
rely on the advice of counsel and other professionals and for anything done,
omitted or suffered by the Securityholders Agent shall not be liable to
anyone while acting in its capacity as Securityholders Agent (unless arising
out of gross negligence or willful misconduct). The Securityholders Agent
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically
set forth in this Agreement and no other covenants or obligations shall be
implied under this Agreement against the Securityholders Agent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not act as a limitation on the powers of
the Securityholders Agent determined by it to be reasonably necessary to
carry out the purposes of its obligations. The Former Securityholders, on a
pro rata basis, shall indemnify the Securityholders Agent and hold it
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred on the part of the
Securityholders Agent (unless arising out of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct) and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties under this Agreement. The Securityholders
Agent shall be entitled to satisfy any such loss, liability and expense from
the proceeds of the Expense Reserve Amount, or if the amount of the loss,
liability or expense

  

### 

  

### 98   

     
   

  

### 

  

### exceeds the Expense Reserve Amount, the Escrow Amount received by the
Securityholders Agent for distribution to the Former Securityholders on a
pro rata basis.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Securityholders Agent may use the Expense Reserve Amount to pay
the expenses incurred by the Securityholders Agent under the authorization
granted in **Section 11.6(a) **and to satisfy the indemnification
obligations of the Former Securityholders to the Securityholders Agent
pursuant to **Section 11.6(b)**. However, the Expense Reserve Amount shall
not serve as a cap on the Former Securityholders obligation to indemnify
the Securityholders Agent pursuant to  **Section 11.6(b)**. Any Expense
Reserve Amount remaining after payment of all of the Securityholders Agents
expenses following the later of (i) the resolution of all indemnification
claims under Article XI hereof and the determination by the Securityholders
Agent that such funds are no longer necessary in connection with
indemnification claims that may be brought thereunder and (ii) the payment of
the maximum amount recoverable by the Parent Indemnified Parties from the
Former Securityholders, if any, shall be distributed to the
Former Securityholders on a pro rata basis. The Expense Reserve Amount shall
not be available to any Parent Indemnified Party to satisfy any claims
hereunder.

  

### 

  

### (d) When discharging its duties hereunder with regard to third party
claims for which any of the Parent Indemnified Parties have made a claim for
indemnification pursuant to **Section 11.1** of this Agreement, the
Securityholders Agent shall have reasonable access to information about the
Company and Parent and the reasonable assistance of the Surviving Companys
and Parents officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties and
exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the Securityholders Agent
shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or
about the Surviving Company or Parent to anyone (except on a need to know
basis to individuals who agree to treat such information

### (e) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholders Agent
shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all of the Former
Securityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
Former Securityholder. Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Securityholders Agent as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of every such Former Securityholder.
