(a) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign Law
shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to a party or to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference
shall be to a party to, a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have their defined meanings when used in any Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement or any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
hereto, unless otherwise defined therein. Whenever used in this Agreement,
"business day" shall mean any day, other than a Saturday or a Sunday or a day
on which banking and savings and loan institutions are authorized or required
by applicable Law to be closed in the State of New York. Whenever the words
"include", "includes", "including" or "such as" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The
word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word
"shall". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" when used
in this Agreement is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase shall not mean simply "if". Whenever used in this Agreement, any noun
or pronoun shall be deemed to include the plural as well as the singular and
to cover all genders. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred
to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time
amended, supplemented or modified, including (i) (in the case of agreements or
instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession
of comparable successor statutes and (ii) all attachments thereto and
instruments incorporated therein. The words "asset" and "property" shall be

SECTION 2.02. _Sale of the Transferred Equity Interests_. Pursuant to the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing, (a) U.S. Seller shall sell, convey, assign and transfer to Buyer, and
Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept, the Transferred Equity Interests in
respect of the U.S. Transferred Company and (b) UK Seller shall sell, convey,
assign and transfer to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept,
the Transferred Equity Interests in respect of the UK Transferred Company, in
each case, free and clear of all Liens and, in the case of the Transferred
Equity Interests in respect of the UK Transferred Company, with Full Title
Guarantee and with all rights and benefits attached or accruing to such
Transferred Equity Interests as at Closing (including all rights to receive
distributions and dividends declared, paid or made in respect of such

duly executed transfer forms duly endorsed in blank and (ii) UK Seller shall
deliver at the Closing share certificates and duly executed stock transfer

Transferred Company. Each Seller hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives
all rights of pre-emption and any other rights or restrictions over the
Transferred Equity Interests held by it which are conferred by the articles of
association, by-laws or other constitutional documents of the U.S. Transferred
Company or UK Transferred Company or in any other way.

 



 

SECTION 2.03. _Purchase Price._ The Purchase Price shall equal the Closing
Payment (net of any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.04) minus the UK Intra-
Group Debt Amount plus the Earn-Out Payments, if any, to be paid by Buyer
pursuant to Section 2.05.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section
2.03(c)), at the Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller, in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts
designated in writing by Seller at least three business days prior to the
Closing Date, cash in U.S. dollars equal to (i) $165,000,000 (the " _Closing
Payment_ ") and (ii) plus or minus an estimate, prepared by Seller and
delivered to Buyer at least three business days prior to the Closing Date, of
any adjustment to the Closing Payment under Section 2.04, (iii) minus the
Seller Transaction Expenses and (iv) minus an estimate, prepared by Seller and
delivered to Buyer at least three business days prior to the Closing Date, of
the Bonus Adjustment Amount calculated by reference to the closing price of
U.S. Seller's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the fourth
business day prior to the Closing Date (the Closing Payment, as so adjusted,
being hereinafter called the " _Closing Date Amount_ "). Seller shall provide
Buyer with reasonable access to such information used by Seller in its
calculation of the Closing Date Amount and Seller shall consider in good faith
any comments Buyer may have with respect to such calculation prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) The Closing Payment shall be subject to the adjustment provisions of
Section 2.04 and the Purchase Price shall be allocated as described in Section
2.06.

 



 

(c) The payment by Buyer to Seller pursuant to Section 2.03(a) of a portion of
the Closing Payment equal to the UK Intra-Group Debt Amount shall be deemed to
be (i) a loan from Buyer to the UK Transferred Company in an amount equal to
the UK Intra-Group Debt Amount, followed by (ii) the transfer by the UK
Transferred Company of cash in an amount equal to the UK Intra-Group Debt
Amount in satisfaction of the UK Intra-Group Debt.

 



 

SECTION 2.04. _Closing Payment_ _Adjustment._ (a) Within 90 days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller (i) a statement (the "
_Statement_ "), setting forth Adjusted Working Capital as of the close of
business on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, except as
otherwise provided for in the proviso to Section 2.04(i) (" _Closing Adjusted
Working Capital_ ") and (ii) an updated schedule setting forth the final
amounts payable pursuant to the retention awards set forth on _Schedule_
___8.01(o)_ _(ii)_ based on the closing price of U.S. Seller's common stock on
the New York Stock Exchange as of the Closing Date, such schedule to be used
to determine whether any adjustment to the Bonus Adjustment Amount is
required, and such adjusted value is referred to herein as the " _Final Bonus
Adjustment Amount_ ".

 



 

(a) The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 90th
day following delivery thereof, unless Seller gives written notice of its
disagreement with the Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer
prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable
detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include
disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on Closing Adjusted
Working Capital not being calculated in accordance with this Section 2.04. If
a Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer during such 90-day period, then
the Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall become final
and binding upon Seller and Buyer on the earlier of (A) the date Seller and
Buyer resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified by Seller in the Notice of Disagreement and (B) the date any
disputed matters are finally resolved by the Accounting Firm (as defined
below). During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified by Seller
in the Notice of Disagreement. During such period Buyer and its independent
accountants shall have access to the working papers of Seller's independent
accountants prepared in connection with the Notice of Disagreement. At the end
of such 30-day period, Seller and Buyer shall submit to an independent
accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution any and all matters
that were included by Seller in the Notice of Disagreement and that remain in
dispute. The Accounting Firm shall be Deloitte and Touche LLP or, if such firm
is unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer
(such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld).

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm
to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to it within 30
days of such submission. In resolving matters submitted to it pursuant to
Section 2.04(b), the Accounting Firm (i) shall base its decision based solely
on written submissions by Seller and Buyer and their respective
representatives and not by independent review and (ii) with respect to each
matter submitted to it, shall not resolve such matter in a manner that is more
favorable to Buyer than the Statement or more favorable to Seller than the
Notice of Disagreement.

 



 

(c) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be
limited to whether there were mathematical errors in the Statement or whether
the Statement was prepared in accordance with the Adjusted Accounting
Principles with respect to the matters submitted for resolution to the
Accounting Firm. Any disputes not within the scope of disputes to be resolved
by the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.04(d) as well as any
disputes about the scope of disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm
pursuant to this Section 2.04(d) shall be resolved in accordance with Section
11.12.

 



 

(d) The final determination by the Accounting Firm of the matters submitted to
it pursuant to Section 2.04(b) shall: (i) be in writing; (ii) include the
Accounting Firm's calculation of the Adjusted Closing Payment; (iii) include
the Accounting Firm's determination of each matter submitted to it pursuant to
Section 2.04(b); and (iv) include a brief summary of the Accounting Firm's
reasons for its determination of each issue.

 



 

(e) The dispute resolution by the Accounting Firm under this Section 2.04
shall constitute an expert determination under New York CPLR Article 76 and
shall not constitute an arbitration. The determinations of the Accounting Firm
shall be final and binding, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in New
York State Supreme Court or any other court having jurisdiction over the party
against which such determination is to be enforced. The cost of any dispute
resolution (including the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and
reasonable attorney fees and expenses of the parties) pursuant to this Section
2.04 shall be borne by Seller and Buyer in inverse proportion as they may
prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the
determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted.

 



 

(f) The Closing Payment shall be increased by the sum of the amount by which
Closing Adjusted Working Capital exceeds the Target Amount, and the amount by
which the Bonus Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final Bonus Adjustment Amount,
and the Closing Payment shall be decreased by the sum of the amount by which
Closing Adjusted Working Capital is less than the Target Amount and the amount
by which the Bonus Adjustment Amount is less than the Final Bonus Adjustment
Amount (the Closing Payment as so increased or decreased shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Adjusted_ _Closing Payment_ "). If the Closing Date
Amount is less than the Adjusted Closing Payment, Buyer shall, and if the
Closing Date Amount is more than the Adjusted Closing Payment, Seller shall,
within 10 business days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the
parties, make payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds of the
amount of such difference to an account designated in writing by the receiving
party.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(g) In connection with the determination of Closing Adjusted Working Capital
pursuant to this Section 2.04, from the Closing Date through the resolution of
any adjustment to the Closing Payment contemplated by this Section 2.04, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, afford to Seller and its independent
accountants reasonable access to the personnel, properties, books and records
of the Business, including the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries,
for any purpose reasonably related to the adjustment contemplated by this
Section 2.04 (subject to reasonable confidentiality restrictions and to
providing such assurances, releases, indemnities or other agreements as
accountants may customarily require in such circumstances).

 



 

(h) In this Agreement:

 



 

" _Adjusted Accounting Principles_ " means (i) the principles, policies and
procedures set forth in _Schedule 2.04(b)_ and (ii) with respect to any
matter not covered by clause (i) above, the principles, policies and
procedures applied in connection with the preparation of the 2016 Financial
Statements.

 



 

" _Adjusted Working Capital_ " means Current Assets minus Current Liabilities.
The terms " _Current Assets_ " and " _Current Liabilities_ " mean the current
assets and current liabilities, respectively, of the Transferred Companies and
their Subsidiaries subject only to adjustment in accordance with _Schedule
2.04(b)_ and calculated on a consolidated basis in accordance with the
Adjusted Accounting Principles; _provided_ that Current Liabilities shall not
include any amounts set forth on _Schedule 8.01(o)_.

 



 

" _Target Amount_ " means $0.00.

 



 

SECTION 2.05. _Earn-Out Payments._ (a) Subject to Section 7.09, on the Earn-
Out Payment Date, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller, in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts
designated in writing by Seller at least three business days prior to the
Earn-Out Payment Date, cash in U.S. dollars equal to the Earn-Out Payments, if
any, to which Seller is entitled pursuant to Section 7.09.

 



 

(a) Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge and agree that all Earn-Out Payment
amounts payable to Seller shall be (x) treated for Tax purposes as a portion
of the Purchase Price and as payment for the Transferred Equity Interests,
except to the extent required by applicable Law and (y) be subject to the
Subordination Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 2.06. _Allocation of Purchase Price._ Buyer and Seller shall agree to
allocate an amount of the Purchase Price equal to $31,000,000 minus the UK
Intra-Group Debt Amount (the " _UK Purchase Price_ ") to all the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the UK Transferred Company and an
amount equal to the excess of the Purchase Price over the UK Purchase Price
(the " _U.S. Purchase Price_ ") to all the assets of the U.S. Transferred
Company. No later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a statement allocating the U.S. Purchase Price among the assets of the
U.S. Transferred Company (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable Treasury
Regulations. Buyer shall deliver a written notice to Seller within 30 days
after Buyer's receipt of the Allocation Statement either accepting or
objecting to the Allocation Statement, and, if Buyer shall not have delivered
such written notice within such 30-day period, Buyer shall be deemed to have
agreed to the Allocation Statement (and the Allocation Statement shall become
a final allocation of the U.S. Purchase Price). If Buyer objects to the
Allocation Statement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence,
then Seller and Buyer shall attempt to resolve their differences by good faith
negotiation to agree on a final allocation of the U.S. Purchase Price. If
Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve their differences within 20 days of
Seller's receipt of Buyer's written notice objecting to the Allocation
Statement, then Buyer and Seller shall collectively select an independent
accounting firm (the " _Tax Matters Accounting Firm_ "). The parties shall
instruct the Tax Matters Accounting Firm to use its reasonable best efforts to
determine a final allocation of the U.S. Purchase Price as promptly as
possible and not later than 20 days after submission of the matter to the Tax
Matters Accounting Firm. The dispute resolution by the Tax Matters Accounting
Firm under this Section 2.06 shall constitute an expert determination under
New York CPLR Article 76 and shall not constitute an arbitration. Any disputes
not within the scope of disputes to be resolved by the Tax Matters Accounting
Firm pursuant to this Section 2.06 as well as any disputes about the scope of
disputes to be resolved by the Tax Matters Accounting Firm pursuant to this
Section 2.06 shall be resolved in accordance with Section 11.12. All
determinations of the Tax Matters Accounting Firm relating to the disputed
items, absent fraud, shall be final and binding on the parties and shall
produce a final allocation. The fees and expenses of the Tax Matters
Accounting Firm shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. The UK Purchase
Price, the U.S. Purchase Price and any final allocation of the U.S. Purchase
Price, in each case, agreed or otherwise determined pursuant to this Section
2.06 shall be the " _Final Allocation_ " for purposes of this Agreement. The
parties shall cooperate to adjust the Final Allocation (by adjusting the U.S.
Purchase Price and any final allocation of the U.S. Purchase Price) to reflect
any adjustments made to the Purchase Price, including pursuant to Section
2.04. The Final Allocation shall be final and binding upon the parties for all
Tax purposes and, except as required by applicable Law or as mutually agreed
to in writing by Seller and Buyer, the parties agree to act in accordance with
the Final Allocation for all Tax purposes.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 2.07. _Transfer Taxes._ (a) Any stamp duty assessed by the United
Kingdom will be borne and paid solely by Buyer, _provided_ , _however_ , that
if any such amount shall be incurred by Seller, Buyer shall, subject to
receipt of reasonably satisfactory evidence of Seller's payment thereof,
promptly reimburse Seller. All other Transfer Taxes payable in connection with
the transfer of the Transferred Equity Interests to Buyer shall be borne 50%
by Buyer and 50% by Seller. Each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to avail itself of any available exemptions from any such Taxes or
fees, and to cooperate with the other parties in providing any information and
documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(a) Seller and Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation required to be filed by it with respect to all Transfer Taxes,
and, if required by applicable Law, the parties will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

 



 

SECTION 2.08. _Withholding Taxes_. Buyer is permitted to withhold amounts from
any payment made by Buyer to Seller under this Agreement as required under
applicable Law. However, if Buyer intends to withhold any such amounts from
any such payment, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of such intention and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such notice at least
within thirty (30) days of the expected payment date. Furthermore, Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller to reduce the amount of withholding Taxes
imposed on the payment of any such payment, including by executing and filing
any forms or certificates reasonably required to claim an available reduced
rate of, or exemption from, withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent any amounts are withheld from any such payment solely as a
result of an assignment by Buyer of any of its rights or obligations pursuant
to Section 11.06 to an Affiliate or a third party, Buyer shall pay (or cause
to be paid) such additional amounts as necessary so that after such
withholding has been made (including such withholding applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 2.08) Seller receives an amount equal to the
amount it would have received had no withholding been made.

 



 

SECTION 2.09. _Closing Deliveries by Seller._ At the Closing, Seller will

each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens, and is the record/legal
and beneficial, owner thereof.

 



 

SECTION 3.04. _Sufficiency of Assets._ At the Closing, except for the
exclusion of corporate-level support services that are currently provided by
Seller, and taking into account the Transition Services Agreement and assuming
that all consents set forth on _Schedule 3.04_ have been obtained, the
Transferred Companies will own or have the right to use all of the assets,
interests in property and rights that are used and reasonably necessary to
conduct, in all material respects, the Business as it is conducted as of the
date hereof and anticipated to be conducted as of immediately prior to
Closing.

 



 

SECTION 3.05. _Real Property._ (a) None of the Transferred Companies owns any
real property (or, in respect of the United Kingdom, owns any freehold
property). _Schedule 3.05(a)_ sets forth a correct and complete list of all
leases, subleases, licenses, occupancy agreements or written agreements,
together with all amendments, modifications, supplements, renewals, extensions
and guarantees related thereto, that grant to the Transferred Company or any
of their Subsidiaries the right to lease, sublease, license, use or occupy any
real property used in the conduct of the Business as of the date hereof,
excluding the Excluded Leases (the " _Real Property Leases_ "), and which
constitutes, together with the Excluded Leases, all the real property used in
the conduct of the Business as currently conducted and no other real property
(other than with respect to the Excluded Leases) is necessary to conduct the
Business as currently conducted. A true, correct and complete copy of each
Real Property Lease has been made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof,
and none of such Real Property Leases have been modified as of the date hereof
in any material respect, except to the extent that such modifications are
disclosed by the copies delivered or otherwise made available to Buyer.

 



 

(b) The Transferred Companies or one of their Subsidiaries have valid and
subsisting title to a leasehold estate under each Real Property Lease (with
the leasehold estate demised under each Real Property Lease being the "
_Leased Real Property_ "). The Leased Real Property is free and clear of all
Liens other than Permitted Liens. Neither the execution or delivery of this
Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
require the consent of, or notice to, any landlords of any Real Property
Leases, nor to Seller's knowledge, entitle such landlords to terminate the
Real Property Lease or recapture the Leased Real Property, increase rent,
charge any additional fees, or require any other modifications to the terms
and conditions of any Real Property Lease.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) all improvements,
equipment, machinery and fixtures located within the demised premises
constituting the Leased Real Property are in good operating condition and
repair, have been maintained in accordance with commercially reasonable
standards and are adequate and suitable in all material respects for the
present and continued use and operation thereof as used or operated as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, (ii) there are no pending or threatened condemnation or eminent
domain proceedings, and none of Transferred Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries have received any notice of any such condemnation or eminent
domain proceedings, affecting the Leased Real Property which, if adversely
decided, would interfere with its present use in the Business and (iii) none
of Seller, the Transferred Companies or any Subsidiary of a Transferred
Company has subleased, licensed or otherwise granted any third party the right
to use or occupy any portion of the Leased Real Property.

 



 

SECTION 3.06. _Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities._ 
(a) _Schedule 3.06_ sets forth the following financial statements of the
Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries: the unaudited balance sheets of
U.S. Seller as of March 31, 2016 (the " _2016_ _U.S. Seller_ _Balance Sheet_
") and December 31, 2015 and 2014, the unaudited statements of working capital
of UK Seller and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2016 (the " _2016 UK Seller
WC Statement_ ") and December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the unaudited income
statements of the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries for the three-
month period ended March 31, 2016 (together with the 2016 U.S. Seller Balance
Sheet and the 2016 UK Seller WC Statement, the " _2016 Financial Statements_
") and the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014
(collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ "). The Financial Statements
present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the
Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries (except for Taxes) as of the
dates of, and the periods referred to in, such Financial Statements in
conformity with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto). The Financial Statements have been prepared
on the basis of information derived from the books and records of the
Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries, which are maintained in the
ordinary course of business and are reliable, complete and accurate. The
Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries have established and maintain
systems of internal accounting controls that are designed to provide
reasonable assurances that all transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit the preparation of proper and accurate financial statements in
accordance with GAAP. Neither Seller nor the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Seller, any auditor, accountant or
representative of the foregoing has received any unresolved material written
complaint, allegation or assertion of a problem or claim regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the
Transferred Companies or their respective accounting controls.

 



 

(b) The accounts receivable of the Transferred Companies, as set forth on
the Financial Statements or arising since the date thereof, (i) have arisen
solely out of bona fide sales and deliveries of materials, supplies, goods,
services, equipment, assets and other business transactions in the ordinary
course of business, (ii) have been billed or invoiced in the ordinary course
of business in accordance with all applicable Law and (iii) are not subject to

discounts.

their Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent,
absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, required to be set forth on
the 2016 Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities or
obligations (i) disclosed, set forth or reserved against on the face of the
2016 Balance Sheet and the notes thereto, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course
of business since the date of the 2016 Balance Sheet (but excluding
liabilities arising out of a breach of, or default under, any agreement,
breach of warranty, tort or infringement claim or lawsuit), or (iii) incurred
in entering into this Agreement and/or performing obligations pursuant to, and
in accordance with, the terms hereof and taken into account in the calculation
of the Adjusted Closing Payment.

 



 

SECTION 3.07. _Consents and Approvals; Absence of Violation or Conflicts._
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents by Seller, nor the consummation by Seller of the

thereof shall: (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any provisions of
the respective certificate of incorporation, by-laws or similar organizational

Transferred Companies or their Subsidiaries, except such violations that would

material respect, the ability of Seller to consummate the Transactions; or
(iv) result in a material violation of or material default (or an event that,
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would become a material
default) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or
acceleration of any material obligation or to loss of a material benefit
under, any material Contract to which a Transferred Company or its Subsidiary
is a party or by which any of their respective properties is bound.

with any trust described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No event has
occurred and no condition exists that would subject a Transferred Company by
reason of its affiliation with any current or former ERISA Affiliates to any
material Liability under Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412(n) or 4971 of the Code. None of the Assumed Benefit Plans in which U.S.

(f) None of Seller, any of its Affiliates, any corporation, trade, business,
or entity that would be deemed a "single employer" with the Transferred
Companies within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) of the Code
or Section 4001 of ERISA (each, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "), or any of their
respective predecessors has contributed to, contributes to, has been required
to contribute to, or otherwise participated in or participates in or in any
way has any liability, directly or indirectly, with respect to any plan
subject to Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code, Section 302 or Title IV of
ERISA.

 



 

(g) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Transactions (alone or in conjunction with any other event) will (i)
entitle any Employee of the Business to any material compensation or benefit,
(ii) accelerate the time of payment, vesting or funding of any material
compensation or benefit or trigger any other material obligation under any
Assumed Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the breach or violation of or default
under, or limit Buyer's right to amend, merge, modify or terminate, any
Assumed Benefit Plan; or (iv) result in any payment (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified individual" (as such
term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that could reasonably
be construed, individually or in combination with any other such payment, to
constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code). No person is entitled to receive any additional payment (including
any tax gross-up or other payment) from Buyer or any of Transferred Companies
as a result of the imposition of the excise taxes required by Section 4999 of
the Code or any taxes required by Section 409A of the Code.

requirements for such tax treatment; (ii) if intended to be funded and/or
book-reserved, is fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based
upon reasonable actuarial assumptions and does not have unfunded liabilities
or liabilities that could reasonably be imposed upon the assets of the
Transferred Companies or Buyer by reason of such Non-U.S. Plan; and (iii) is
in compliance with all its terms and all applicable Laws, and (iv) if intended
or required to be qualified, approved or registered with a Governmental
Entity, is and has been so qualified, approved or registered and nothing has
occurred that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such
qualification, approval or registration, as applicable.

 



 

(i) Any pension schemes to which the UK Transferred Company is obliged to
provide or contribute to in respect of its employees are money purchase
schemes as defined in section 181 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 and the UK

occupational pension scheme providing any benefits which are not money
purchase benefits within that meaning.

ARTICLE IV _ 

Representations and Warranties of Buyer_

 



 

Buyer represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

 



 

SECTION 4.01. _Buyer 's Organization; Power; Execution._ (a) Buyer is a legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (where such
concept is recognized in the relevant jurisdiction) under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or formation. Buyer has full power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to carry out, or cause to be carried
out, the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer has, or will have at the
Closing, full power and authority to execute and deliver each Transaction
Document (other than this Agreement) to which it is or will be a party and to
carry out, or cause to be carried out, the transactions contemplated by each
of the Transaction Documents (other than this Agreement) to which it is or
will be a party, including the Financing. This Agreement has been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Buyer and has been duly
executed and delivered by Buyer and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Seller, constitutes a valid and legally
binding obligation of Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors' rights
generally and (b) the availability of injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies. Each of the Transaction Documents (other than this Agreement) and
the Financing has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
Buyer and has been, or will be at the Closing, duly executed and delivered by
Buyer and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of such
Transaction Document by Seller, constitutes or will constitute a valid and
legally binding obligation of Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to
creditors' rights generally and (b) the availability of injunctive relief and
other equitable remedies.

 



 

(b) Buyer is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Transactions.

 



 

SECTION 4.02. _Consents and Approvals; Absence of Violation or Conflicts._
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents by Buyer, nor the consummation by Buyer of the
Transactions nor compliance by Buyer with any of the provisions hereof or
thereof, including the Financing shall: (i) conflict with or result in any
breach of any provisions of (a) the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or
similar organizational documents or (b) any material Contract, in each case,
of Buyer; (ii) require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or
filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (a) in
connection with the Anti-Trust Filings and (b) any consent, approval,
authorization or permit required to be obtained by Seller or filing or
notification required to be made by Seller in order to transfer title to the
Transferred Equity Interests or otherwise operate the Business, which consent,
approval, authorization or permit is customary in transactions of the type
contemplated hereby; (iii) assuming compliance with clause (ii) of this
Section 4.02, violate in any material respect any material Law applicable to
Buyer; or (iv) result in a material violation of or default (or an event that,
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, any material Contract
to which Buyer is a party or by which any of its properties is bound.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 4.03. _Litigation._ There are no legal, administrative, arbitration or
other proceedings or governmental investigations pending or, to the knowledge
of Buyer, threatened in writing concerning Buyer or any of its Affiliates, nor
is there any Judgment outstanding against Buyer or any of its Affiliates or to
which any of their respective properties is subject, in each case, seeks to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of, or materially impair Buyer's
ability to consummate, the transactions contemplated by, or the performance by
Buyer of its obligations under, this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 4.04. _Financing._ Buyer has delivered to Seller true and complete
copies of the executed commitment letter dated as of the date hereof (such
commitment letter, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments
thereto, as may be modified pursuant to Section 6.04, the " _Debt Financing
Commitments_ " or the " _Financing Commitments_ "), among Parent, Goldman
Sachs Specialty Lending Holdings, Inc., AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company,
Special Value Continuation Partners, LP, TCPC Funding I, LLC, Tennenbaum

Benefit Street Partners Senior Secured Debt Master Fund (Non-US) LP, Addington
Square Private Credit Fund, L.P., AB Private Credit Investors Middle Market
Direct Lending Fund, L.P. (collectively, the " _Commitment Parties "_),
pursuant to which each of the Commitment Parties has agreed, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to lend a portion of the amounts set forth
therein (the " _Debt Financing_ " or the " _Financing_ ") for the purpose of
funding the Transactions and related fees and expenses. As of the date of this
Agreement, each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is in
full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent
and, to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Financing Commitments have not been amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified in any respect, no amendment, supplement or modification
is contemplated (except, in each case, with the prior written consent of
Seller or as permitted by Section 6.04), and the financing commitments
thereunder have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As
of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or any other parties
thereto under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments, and Buyer
has no reason to believe that any term or condition of closing set forth in
the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied on a timely basis, or that any
portion of the Financing to be made thereunder will otherwise not be available
to Parent on a timely basis to consummate the Transactions at the time
required pursuant to this Agreement. Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid
thereunder on or prior to the date of this Agreement and Buyer shall cause
Parent in the future to pay any such fees as they become due. The Financing,
when funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments and contributed by
Parent to Buyer, together with cash on hand or other sources of immediately
available funds, will provide Buyer with funds sufficient to satisfy all of
Buyer's obligations under this Agreement, including the obligations under
Article II, pay any other amounts required to be paid by Buyer in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions and pay all related fees and
expenses of Buyer. The obligations to make the Financing available to Parent
pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments are not subject to any
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Contracts or other
agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) or
commitments to enter into agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether
oral or written) to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party related to
the Financing other than as expressly contained in the Financing Commitments
and delivered to Seller prior to the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt,
it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement for Parent or Buyer to
obtain the Financing or any alternative financing.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 4.05. _Solvency._ Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to
Buyer's obligation to consummate the Transactions, and after giving effect to
the Transactions and the payment of the Purchase Price, any repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing
Commitments and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Seller set forth in Article III hereof in all material respects, Buyer will be
Solvent immediately after the completion of the Closing. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any person,
means that, as of any date of determination (A) the amount of the "fair
saleable value" of the assets of such person will, as of such date, exceed (1)
the value of all "liabilities of such person, including contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (2) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(B) such person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date, and (C) such person will be able
to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" mean that such person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 4.06. _Brokerage Fees._ Except for fees payable to RBC Capital
Markets, LLC (which fees are payable by Parent), there are no claims for
brokerage commissions, finders' fees or similar compensation in connection
with the Transactions based on any arrangement or agreement made by or on
behalf of Buyer or any Affiliate thereof.

 



 

SECTION 4.07. _Securities Act._ The Transferred Equity Interests are being
acquired for investment only and not with a view to any public distribution
thereof, and neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall offer to sell or
otherwise dispose of the Transferred Equity Interests so acquired by it in

issuing the same) and, after its release, shall provide the other party with a
copy thereof.

 



 

SECTION 6.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Approvals; Access._ Subject
to any obligation imposed by Law, including all anti-trust and competition
Laws:

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
Seller and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) make the Anti-
Trust Filings and any other filings required by applicable Law, (ii) obtain
and maintain consents, approvals (including pursuant to any anti-trust or
competition Law), authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental
Entities and other third parties that are reasonably necessary, proper,
advisable or desirable to consummate the Transactions and (iii) take, or cause
to be taken, all other actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, in
each case as is reasonably necessary, proper, advisable or desirable under
applicable Law to consummate the Transactions as soon as reasonably practical
following the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that, except as provided in
this Section 6.03, neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any obligation to pay
money or make any concessions in connection with the foregoing and shall be
under no obligation to commence, defend or participate in any litigation in
connection therewith or to offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third party in connection therewith. In addition to the
foregoing, (x) Buyer agrees to provide such evidence as to financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by
any third party whose consent or approval is sought hereunder and (y) Buyer
and Seller will cooperate with respect to the matters set forth on _Schedule
6.03(a)_. Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, each of the
parties hereto will cooperate with and furnish to the other party such
necessary information and assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, Seller and Buyer shall file the Anti-Trust
Filings and any other filings required under any applicable Laws and shall
provide to any Governmental Entity whose consent, authorization, order or
approval is required in connection with the Transactions any additional
information required under any applicable Laws or otherwise properly
requested. The parties shall, subject to Section 6.03(d), use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain early termination of any applicable waiting period, to
the extent required, from the applicable Governmental Entities. Seller and
Buyer shall not extend, directly or indirectly, any such waiting period or
enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to
consummate the Transactions on the Closing Date, except with the prior written
consent of the other party to this Agreement (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The parties also shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cooperate by providing information reasonably
requested by the other party in order to fulfill the foregoing obligations.
From and after the date hereof and until all governmental approvals required
in connection with the Transactions have been obtained, Buyer shall not, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, operate its business in such manner
or take any action, that would reasonably be expected to materially increase
the risk of not obtaining any such governmental approval or clearance or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period. All filing fees
payable in connection with the Anti-Trust Filings shall be borne by Buyer.

 



 

(c) Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Buyer
and Seller and their respective counsel shall (i) have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other on, any
filing made with, or written materials to be submitted to, any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions, (ii) promptly inform each other of
any communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) received from, or
given to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions, (iii)
consult with the other party, and consider in good faith the views of the
other party, prior to entering into any agreement with any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Transactions and (iv) furnish each other with copies of
all correspondence, filings and written communications between them or their
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or its respective
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Transactions. Buyer and Seller
shall, to the extent practicable, provide each other and their respective
counsel with advance notice of and the opportunity to participate in any in-
person discussion or meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the Transactions and
to participate in the preparation for such discussion or meeting. Buyer also
agrees to keep Seller fully informed about any anti-trust issues raised by any
Governmental Entity.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) If any objections are asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Transactions under any applicable anti-trust or competition Law or which
would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, or if any action is instituted by any
Governmental Entity or any private party challenging the Transactions as
violative of any applicable anti-trust or competition Law, or an order is
issued enjoining the Transactions, each of Seller and Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to
permit consummation of the Transactions by the Closing as soon as practicable;
_provided_ that the parties hereto understand and agree that reasonable best
efforts of any party shall not be deemed to include: (i) entering into any
settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
other than (A) ordinary course regulatory requests principally directed to
supervisory concerns and (B) those that would not impose a significant burden
on any party, (ii) litigating or initiating any claim against a Governmental
Entity or (iii) divesting or otherwise holding separate, or otherwise selling,
operating in a specific manner, discontinuing or limiting any of its or their
respective Affiliates' other businesses, assets or properties.

 



 

(e) Seller shall give Buyer and its accountants, legal counsel and other
representatives reasonable access upon reasonable advance notice, for the sole
purpose of allowing Buyer to successfully transition the Business, during
normal business hours and without undue interruption of Seller's or any of its
Affiliates' normal operation of their respective businesses, including the
Business, throughout the period prior to the Closing, to all of the
properties, books and records relating to the Business, and will furnish, at
Buyer's expense, Buyer, its accountants, legal counsel and other
representatives during such period all such information concerning the affairs
of the Business as Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ that this Section
6.03(e) shall not require Seller to provide Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
any of their respective representatives with access to any document,
communication or information (i) related to the Transactions, the sale process
with respect to the Business or the possible sale of the Business, (ii) that
Seller believes in good faith to be covered by any attorney-client work
product or similar privilege or the subject of a confidentiality agreement,
(iii) the disclosure of which is prohibited by applicable Law, and (iv)
related to income Taxes; _provided_ _further_ that this Section 6.03(e) shall
not entitle Buyer or its accountants, legal counsel or other representatives
to contact any third party doing business with Seller or access the
properties, books or records of any third party, in each case without Seller's
prior written consent. All information received by Buyer or any of its
representatives and given by or on behalf of Seller in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions will be held by Buyer and its Affiliates and
representatives as confidential information pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. From and after the date hereof and to the Closing,
without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall contact any suppliers or vendors to, or customers of, the
Business in connection with or pertaining to any subject matter of this
Agreement. Seller agrees, upon the request of Buyer, to provide written notice
to counterparties under Contracts that require such notice to be given in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 6.04. _Financing._ (a) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws, and to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, such instruments and documents as may be required, to obtain the
Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and subject only
to the conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions
contained in the Financing Commitments or on other terms acceptable to Buyer
so long as such definitive agreements (A) do not contain any additional or
modified conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Financing
than those contained in the Financing Commitments as of the date of this
Agreement (other than additional or modified conditions or contingencies that
would not be prohibited in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section
6.04), (B) are in a form that is otherwise not reasonably likely to prevent,
impede or delay the availability of the Financing or the Closing and (C) do
not reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing set forth in the
Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement, unless in case of this
clause (C), replaced with an amount of new financing on conditions no less
favorable to Seller than the terms set forth in the Financing Commitments as
of the date hereof, (ii) satisfy, and cause its Affiliates to satisfy, on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer or its Affiliates contained in
the Financing Commitments and (iii) consummate the Financing contemplated by
the Financing Commitments at the Closing, including by taking enforcement
action to cause the financial institutions providing the Debt Financing to
fund the Debt Financing. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that is reasonably
likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in the
Financing Commitments or in any definitive agreement related to the Financing.

 



 

(a) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.04, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
consummate the Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein are not conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the
Financing, the availability of any replacement commitments or receipt of the
proceeds therefrom and, accordingly, the parties hereto agree that a failure
of Buyer to close the Transactions resulting from a failure or inability to
consummate the Financing constitutes a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any Financing Commitments
or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing without Seller's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_
that Buyer or Parent may amend, supplement or modify the Financing Commitments
or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing without Seller's prior
written consent if such amendment, supplement or modification does not (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in the Financing
Commitments as of the date of this Agreement (unless, in case of this clause
(i), replaced with an amount of new equity financing on conditions no less
favorable to Seller than the terms set forth in the Financing Commitments as
of the date hereof), (ii) contain any additional or modified conditions or
other contingencies to the funding of the Financing than those contained in
the Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement or (iii) modify in
a manner adverse to Buyer or Parent the conditions to the funding,
enforceability, availability or termination of the Financing or otherwise make
the impairment or delay of the funding of the Financing or the Closing
reasonably likely.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, Buyer shall promptly notify
Seller, and Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable
best efforts to obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event, replacement commitments on terms that will enable
Buyer to consummate the Transactions and that are not less favorable in the
aggregate to Seller than those contained in the Financing Commitments;
_provided_ that such replacement commitments shall not (i) contain any
additional or modified conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the
Financing than those contained in the Financing Commitments as of the date of
this Agreement or (ii) otherwise be reasonably likely to prevent, impede or
delay the availability of the Financing or the Closing . Buyer shall deliver
to Seller complete and correct copies of all amendments, supplements, other
modifications or agreements (including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which
any amended, supplemented, modified or replacement commitments shall provide
Buyer with any portion of the Financing. Upon any amendment, supplement,
modification or replacement of the Financing Commitments in accordance with
this Section 6.04, the terms "Financing", "Financing Commitment" and "Redacted
Fee Letter" shall be in reference to such amended, supplemented, modified or
replaced commitment.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) Seller shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
accountants, legal counsel and other advisors to provide commercially
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer that is customary in
connection with the arrangement of bank debt financing that is substantially
similar to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments
as of the date of this Agreement (at Buyer's sole expense (but solely to the
extent of the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorney's fees) so incurred by Seller or its Affiliates),
including (i) participation in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence
sessions, presentations, and sessions with rating agencies, including direct
contact between senior management and representatives (including accounting)
of the Transferred Companies, on the one hand, and Buyer and its lenders and
potential lenders, on the other hand, (ii) assisting with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda,
syndication documents (including lender presentations), including business
projections reasonably requested by Buyer, in each case, required in
connection with the Debt Financing, and furnishing all documentation and other
information reasonably required by any financing sources for compliance with
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001, at least three (3)
business days prior to Closing (to the extent requested a reasonable time in
advance thereof), (iii) permitting Buyer's lenders to conduct a reasonable due
diligence review of the Transferred Companies, (iv) furnishing Buyer and its
lenders with financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Transferred Companies that is customary for inclusion in or preparation of the
confidential information memorandum contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments, as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, (v) executing customary
authorization and management representation letters to the extent required in
connection with the Debt Financing, (vi) assisting in obtaining corporate,
credit and facility ratings from rating agencies, (vii) causing the
Transferred Companies to assist in the preparation of, and to execute and
deliver, definitive financing documents, including guarantee, pledge, security
and collateral documents and customary closing certificates as may be required
by the Financing and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of
collateral; _provided_ that the Transferred Companies shall not be required to
execute any such document or instrument contemplated by this Section 6.04(e)
that would become effective prior to the Closing Date, (viii) using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations and instruments which may reasonably be requested by Buyer to
permit the consummation of the Financing and collateral arrangements,
including to obtain payoff letters, releases, terminations, waivers, consents,
estoppels and approvals as may be reasonably required in connection therewith,
and (ix) taking all corporate actions of the Transferred Companies reasonably
necessary to authorize the consummation of the Financing and to permit the
proceeds thereof to be made available at the Closing; _provided_ that (A) such
requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Seller and its Affiliates, (B) Seller shall not be required to
provide any audited or unaudited "carve-out" financial statements of the
Business other than the Financial Statements, (C) Seller shall not be required
to provide any updates to the Financial Statements, (D) such cooperation shall
not cause any representation, warranty, covenant or other term in this
Agreement to be breached or cause any closing condition set forth in Article V
to fail to be satisfied and (E) such requested cooperation shall not require
Seller or its Affiliates to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or
agree to pay any commitment or other fees or reimburse any expenses prior to
the Closing, or incur any liability or give any indemnities or otherwise
commit to take any action that is not contingent upon the Closing. Buyer
shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including attorney's fees)
in connection with such cooperation. Buyer and its Affiliates shall, on a
joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
from and against any damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith. Seller hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Business, the
Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing;
_provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended
to, or reasonably likely to, harm or disparage Seller or such Affiliates or
the reputation or goodwill of Seller or such Affiliates.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(e) Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a timely basis of the status of the
Financing and any material developments relating to the Financing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give Seller prompt
notice of (i) any default or breach (or any event that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach) by any party under the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing of which Buyer becomes aware,
(ii) any termination of the Financing Commitments, (iii) the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Person party to a
Financing Commitment with respect to any (x) actual or potential default,
breach, termination or repudiation of any material provision of any Financing
Commitment, any definitive agreement relating to the Financing or any
provision of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating
to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or (y) material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing, including any condition with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing, or the amount of Financing to be funded on
the Closing Date, (iv) if for any reason Buyer believes in good faith that it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms,
in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments or
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing and (v) any amendment,
supplement or modifications of, or waiver of any rights under, any Financing
Commitment or the definitive agreements with respect to the Financing. As soon
as reasonably practicable, and in any event, within two business days after
the date Seller delivers to Buyer a written request, Buyer shall provide any
information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of the immediately
preceding sentence.

 



 

(f) Buyer acknowledges that the information being provided to it in connection
with the Financing is subject to the terms of Section 6.02. With respect to
information disclosed to any rating agency (the " _Confidential Rating Agency
Information_ "), Buyer shall (i) inform such rating agency of the confidential
nature of the Confidential Rating Agency Information and mark any such
information provided in writing to such rating agency as "confidential" and
(ii) instruct such rating agency not to disclose the Confidential Rating
Agency Information to any third party or to specifically exclude such
information in such rating agency's ratings report. Buyer shall be responsible
for any breach of this covenant by any such rating agency.

 



 

SECTION 6.05. _Intercompany Accounts and Contracts._ (a) Prior to 11:59 p.m.,
New York City time, on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall cause all intercompany accounts between Seller and any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries), on
the one hand, and any Transferred Company or any Subsidiary of a Transferred
Company, on the other hand, to be settled or otherwise eliminated.
Intercompany accounts between and among the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries shall not be affected by this provision. Prior to the Closing,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including Section
6.01), Seller and its Subsidiaries shall have the right to facilitate the
settling or elimination of intercompany accounts as contemplated by this
Section 6.05, in each case in such manner as Seller may determine in
consultation with Buyer (including by means of declaring, setting aside or
paying any dividend or distribution, purchasing or redeeming equity interests,
creating or repaying intercompany debt, increasing or decreasing cash pool
balances or otherwise).

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, all Contracts, including all obligations to
provide goods, services or other benefits, but excluding the Transaction
Documents, between Seller and any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any
Transferred Company or any Subsidiary of a Transferred Company, on the other
hand, shall be terminated without any party to such Contracts having any
continuing obligation to the other parties thereto.

 



 

SECTION 6.06. _Transferred Contracts_. (a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to assign, transfer, convey or otherwise
deliver at the Closing the Transferred Contracts to Buyer or one of its
Affiliates (including as of the Closing the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries), including, in the case of Commingled Contracts, by assigning
the portion of such Commingled Contract relating to the operation and conduct
of the Business or using reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable third
party to enter into an amendment or a new agreement, in each case, such that
Buyer and its Affiliates receive substantially all of the benefits and bear
all of the costs, liabilities and burdens with respect to such Transferred
Contracts. To the extent that the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to
Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including as of the Closing the Transferred
Companies and their Subsidiaries) of any Transferred Contract is prohibited by
any applicable Law or would require any governmental or third party
authorizations, approvals, consents, amendments or waivers, the parties shall
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other to obtain promptly
such authorizations, approvals, consents, amendments or waivers prior to the
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be required to pay any
non-de minimis consideration or make any non-de minimis concession therefor;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall not agree to any bundling of
services or discount arrangements without the prior written consent of Buyer
in connection therewith. If such authorization, approval, consent, amendment
or waiver is obtained as of the Closing, Seller shall assign, transfer, convey
or deliver any such Transferred Contract to Buyer or one of its Affiliates
(including as of the Closing the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries), as applicable, at no additional cost at the Closing. If, at the
Closing, such authorization, approval, consent, amendment or waiver shall not
have been obtained, and provided Seller has complied with this Section
6.06(a), then under no circumstances shall Seller or its Affiliates be subject
to any liability solely on account of the failure to obtain any such
authorization, approval, consent, amendment or waiver. Buyer further agrees
that, other than if and to the extent Seller has breached this Section
6.06(a), no representation, warranty or other covenant of Seller, other than
if and to the extent Seller has breached this Section 6.06(a), contained in
this Agreement shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition to
Buyer's obligations to close the Transactions shall be deemed not satisfied as
a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such authorization, approval,
consent, amendment or waiver or as a result of any such default or termination
of any Transferred Contract; or (ii) any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or
investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any authorization, approval,
consent, amendment or waiver or any such default or termination.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) If, at the Closing, such authorization, approval, consent, amendment or
waiver shall not have been obtained, Seller and, and upon the request of
Seller, Buyer shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts until July
1, 2017 (the " _TC Measurement Date_ ") to (i) obtain the consent of the
applicable third party or parties to assign, transfer, convey or otherwise
deliver the Transferred Contracts to Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries), effective as of the Closing
Date, including, in the case of Commingled Contracts, by assigning the portion
of such Commingled Contract relating to the operation and conduct of the
Business, or (ii) cause the applicable third party to enter into an amendment
or a new agreement on terms not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
those of such Transferred Contract (a " _TC Replacement Agreement_ "), in each
case, such that Buyer and its Affiliates receive substantially all of the
benefits and bear all of the costs, liabilities and burdens with respect to
such Transferred Contracts (or applicable portion thereof in the case of
Commingled Contracts), effective as of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither party shall be required to pay any non-de minimis
consideration or make any non-de minimis concession therefor; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Seller shall not agree to any bundling of services or
discount arrangements without the prior written consent of Buyer in connection
with a TC Replacement Contract.

 



 

(c) If a Transferred Contract is not assignable or transferrable in accordance
with paragraph (a) above, and Seller and Buyer cannot obtain the consent of
the applicable third party or parties or enter into a TC Replacement Agreement
in accordance with paragraph (b) above, then from the Closing Date until the
TC Measurement Date (i) any revenues actually received by Seller (the " _TC
Revenues_ ") attributable to a Transferred Contract, or, in the case of
Commingled Contracts, the portion of such Commingled Contract relating to the
operation and conduct of the Business for which an assignment, transfer or
consent in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) has not yet been obtained,
shall be paid to Buyer in cash within 30 days of the last day of the calendar
quarter in which they were received by Buyer.

 



 

(d) In the event that Seller is unable to obtain such an assignment, consent
or TC Replacement Agreement for a Transferred Contract, or, in the case of a
Commingled Contract, the portion of such Commingled Contract relating to the
operation and conduct of the Business, on or before the TC Measurement Date,
Seller shall pay to Buyer within 20 days of the TC Measurement Date an amount
in cash equal to the ratable revenues associated with each such contract

such payments shall be reduced by the TC Revenues attributable to each such
contract previously paid to Buyer by Seller and shall be further reduced by
any ratable revenues to be received by Buyer or one of its Affiliates pursuant
to any amendment or new agreement with the applicable third party or parties
covering substantially the same services as the Transferred Contract.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall TC Revenues or any other

qualifies as a Qualified MFLMS Customer or a Qualified VA/LI Customer.

or (B) threatened against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise
challenge the legality or any transaction contemplated by any Transaction
Document.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a party's good faith
failure to comply with this Section 6.08 shall not provide the other party
hereto or any of such other party's Affiliates with a right not to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in each case, to the
extent that any other provision of this Agreement would independently provide
such right.

 



 

SECTION 6.09. _Rhetorik Transfer._ Prior to the Closing Date, the UK Seller

the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries from and after the Closing)
shall have no rights, and are not acquiring any rights, to use the Seller
Marks after the Closing Date, except as stated in this Section 7.01. Seller
may immediately terminate the rights granted in this Section 7.01 if Buyer or
its Affiliates fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this Section
7.01.

 



 

(a) For a period of 90 days after the Closing Date (the " _Transition Period_
"), Seller hereby grants to Buyer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-

invoice forms, advertisements and promotional materials, products and other
documents and materials containing or bearing any Seller Mark (" _Existing

relationship, Buyer shall ensure that the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries make clear to all other parties to the contractual relationship
that the applicable Transferred Company or its Subsidiary, rather than Seller,
is entering into or conducting the contractual relationship. As promptly as

the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries used the Seller
Marks immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) comply with all
applicable Laws and industry practices in connection with their use and
distribution of the Seller Marks and Existing Stock. All goodwill and improved
reputation generated by the Transferred Companies' and their Subsidiaries' use
and distribution of the Seller Marks inures solely to the benefit of Seller
and its Affiliates.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, and Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not attempt to or knowingly enable or request any other
Person to, (i) use any Seller Mark in any manner, or engage in any other act
or omission, that tarnishes, degrades, disparages or reflects adversely on a
Seller Mark or Seller's or its Affiliates' business or reputation, or that
would otherwise harm the value, reputation or distinctiveness of or Seller's
goodwill in any Seller Mark, (ii) register or file applications to register in
any jurisdiction any trademark, service mark, trade dress, trade name, domain
name, social media user name or other identifier of source or origin that

ownership or validity of any of the Seller Marks.

 



 

(d) Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries) shall not use the Seller Marks after the end of the Transition
Period other than in a descriptive historical or similar non-trademark manner,
except that the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries may at all times
after the Closing Date retain, solely for their internal business purposes,
records and other historical or archived documents containing or referencing
the Seller Marks.

 



 

SECTION 7.02. _Use of Trademarks by Seller During Transition Period._ Buyer
hereby grants to Seller and its Affiliates permission to use the Trademarks
owned by the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries during the term of
the Transition Services Agreement to the extent required by Seller and its
Affiliates to provide the services described therein to Buyer or its
Affiliates.

 



 

(a) Seller shall ensure that the Seller and its Affiliates (i) use such
Trademarks only in the form and manner consistent with, and in connection
with, goods and services of a level of quality equal to or greater than the
quality of goods and services in connection with which the Transferred
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries used such Trademarks immediately
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) comply with all applicable Laws and
industry practices in connection with their use and distribution of such
Trademarks.

 



 

(b) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, and Seller and
its Affiliates shall not attempt to or knowingly enable or request any other
Person to, (i) use any Trademark in any manner, or engage in any other act or
omission, that tarnishes, degrades, disparages or reflects adversely on a
Trademark or Buyer's or its Affiliates' business or reputation, or that would
otherwise harm the value, reputation or distinctiveness of or Buyer's goodwill
in any Trademark, (ii) register or file applications to register in any
jurisdiction any trademark, service mark, trade dress, trade name, domain

SECTION 7.03. _Access._ Buyer will permit Seller and its duly authorized
representatives access during normal business hours (upon 24 hours' written
notice to Buyer) to all Contracts, books, records and other data relating to
the Business, the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries and the
Transferred Equity Interests conveyed and assumed at the Closing to the extent
that such materials were delivered to Buyer, except where such access is
prohibited by applicable Law; _provided_ that such access shall not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Buyer and its
Affiliates. Seller agrees that after the Closing, Buyer or its authorized
representatives may, at Buyer's cost and expense, make copies of those books
and records (or redacted portions thereof) that have not been transferred to
Buyer and relate exclusively to the Business, except where providing copies is
prohibited by applicable Law. All information received by either party in
connection with this Section 7.03 will be held by the other party and its
representatives as confidential information pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. No party shall be required to provide access to
books and records pursuant to this Section 7.03 to the extent such access, in
such party's reasonable judgment would (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or
legal privilege (other than books and records subject to joint defense or
common interest privilege), _provided_ that the requested party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide such document, communication or information
in a manner that does not result in a waiver of such privilege or (ii)
contravene any fiduciary duty or confidentiality obligation.

 



 

SECTION 7.04. _Insurance._ As of the Closing, the Transferred Companies and
their Subsidiaries shall cease to be insured by Seller's or its Affiliates'
insurance policies to the extent such insurance policies cover the Transferred
Companies and their Subsidiaries. With respect to events or circumstances
relating to the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries that occurred or
existed prior to the Closing Date that are covered by such insurance policies
and that apply to the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries, Buyer may
make claims under such policies and Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer, the Transferred Companies
and/or their Subsidiaries pursuing payment under any of the insurance policies
covering the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries in effect as of the
date of this Agreement, as applicable; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that Buyer
shall not make any such claims if, and to the extent that, such claims are
covered by insurance policies purchased by Buyer (including, after Closing,
the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries). With respect to any open
claim against Seller's insurance policies relating to the Transferred
Companies and their Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, Seller agrees to
remit to Buyer any net proceeds realized from such claim (net of any increased
premiums to the extent related to such claim) under such insurance policies
upon full and final settlement of such claim with the underlying insurer(s).

 



 

SECTION 7.05. _Payments from Third Parties._ In the event that, on or after
the Closing Date, either party shall (i) receive any payments or other funds
due to the other pursuant to the terms of any of the Transaction Documents,
then the party receiving such funds shall promptly forward such funds to the
proper party and (ii) make a payment to any Person on behalf of the other
party, then the party on behalf of whom such payment was made agrees to
promptly reimburse the party making such payment. The parties acknowledge and
agree there is no right of offset regarding such payments and a party may not
withhold funds received from third parties for the account of the other party
in the event there is a dispute regarding any other issue under any of the
Transaction Documents.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 7.06. _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement._ For a
period of two years following the Closing:

 



 

(a) Seller covenants that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, engage in the business principally operated in the
United States and the United Kingdom of providing market research, data and
intelligence on financial advisors, advisor-sold investment and insurance
products and mortgages to customers in the asset management, insurance and
mortgage lending industries (the " _Competitive Activity_ "); _provided_ that
nothing in this Section 7.06 shall prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from (i)
engaging in any business conducted by Seller or its Affiliates at the Closing
other than the Business and (ii) performing any of its respective obligations
under the Transaction Documents.

 



 

(b) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly solicit
(or cause to be solicited) for employment any Transferred Employee; _provided_
that the term "solicit for employment" as used in this Section 7.06(b) shall
not be deemed to include generalized searches for employees through media
advertisements of general circulation, open job fairs or similar means not
directed at the Transferred Employees.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly solicit
(or cause to be solicited) for employment any employee of Seller or any of
Seller's Affiliates; _provided_ that the term "solicit for employment" as used
in this Section 7.06(c) shall not be deemed to include generalized searches
for employees through media advertisements of general circulation, open job
fairs or similar means not directed at any such employees of Seller or any of
Seller's Affiliates.

 



 

(d) Buyer and Seller shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
not to, make or publish negative or disparaging remarks that in any way relate
to the other party, its respective Affiliates, or any of their respective
officers, directors or employees.

 



 

SECTION 7.07. _Tax Matters._

 



 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes._

 



 

(i) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns (other than
those relating to Transfer Taxes, which are addressed by Section 2.07)
required to be filed with a Taxing Authority by or with respect to each of the
Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries for any Tax period of each such
entity ending on or before the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_
"). The Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner that is
consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law
or agreed by the parties in writing.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(A) In the case of any Pre-Closing Tax Return that is required to be filed by
any of the Transferred Companies or their Subsidiaries before the Closing
Date, Seller shall timely file or cause to be filed such Tax Return with the
relevant Taxing Authority.

 



 

(B) In the case of any Pre-Closing Tax Return that is required to be filed by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries) after the Closing Date, Seller shall present each such Tax
Return to Buyer for review and comment at least 30 days before the due date of
such Tax Return (taking into account extensions). If Buyer delivers an
objection to Seller with respect to such Tax Return within 20 days after
receipt thereof, then Seller shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments from Buyer and Buyer shall timely file or cause to be filed such Tax
Return in the form agreed by Seller in writing with the relevant Taxing
Authority.

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns (other than those relating to Transfer Taxes, which are
addressed by Section 2.07) required to be filed by or with respect to each of
the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to each such Tax Return, to the
extent relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Tax Return shall be
prepared in a manner that is consistent with past practice, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law or agreed by the parties in writing.
Buyer shall present each such Tax Return to Seller for review and comment at
least 30 days before the due date of such Tax Return (taking into account
extensions), together with any additional information that Seller may
reasonably request. If Seller does not object to such Tax Return within 20
days after receipt thereof, then Seller shall be deemed to have accepted such
Tax Return and Buyer shall timely file or cause to be filed such Tax Return
with the relevant Taxing Authority in such accepted form. If Seller delivers
an objection to Buyer with respect to such Tax Return within 20 days after
receipt thereof, then Buyer shall incorporate all reasonable comments
submitted by Seller to such Tax Return insofar as they relate to Taxes for
which Seller has the obligation to indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section
10.04(a) and Buyer shall timely file or cause to be filed such Tax Return with
the relevant Taxing Authority as so adjusted. Neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries) shall
file an amended Tax Return which would reasonably be expected to increase
Taxes for which Seller has the obligation to indemnify Buyer pursuant to
Section 10.04(a) or otherwise pay to a Taxing Authority, or agree to any
waiver or extension of the statute of limitations relating to Taxes with
respect to, the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries or the Business
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period without the prior written
consent of Seller which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

(iii) All Taxes due and payable with respect to Tax Returns described in
Section 7.07(a) will be paid or caused to be paid by filer to the relevant
Taxing Authority, subject to reimbursement by the other party pursuant to
Section 10.04.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) _Refunds._ Any refund or credit of Taxes paid by or with respect to the
Transferred Companies or their Subsidiaries before the Closing (including by
way of an offset against Taxes in a tax period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax
Period) or pursuant to an indemnity claim under Section 10.04(a) shall belong
to Seller, except to the extent such refund or credit was included in the
calculation of the adjustment to the Closing Payment pursuant to Section 2.04.
All other refunds or credits of Taxes paid by or with respect to the
Transferred Companies or their Subsidiaries shall belong to Buyer. Buyer or
Seller shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, pay Seller or
Buyer, respectively, the portion of any such refund, credit or offset of Taxes
to which Seller or Buyer, respectively, is entitled under this Section
7.07(b), (i) in the case of a refund, within 10 business days after receipt
thereof or (ii) in the case of a credit or offset, within 10 business days
after such credit is allowed or applied against any other Tax liability. If
any portion of a refund or credit is subsequently disallowed by any Taxing
Authority, then amounts previously paid hereunder in respect thereof shall be
promptly reimbursed by the payee to the payor.

 



 

(c) _Miscellaneous._

 



 

(i) With respect to the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries, Buyer
shall not make or change any election with respect to Taxes that would give
rise to a Seller Tax indemnity obligation under Section 10.04(a).

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall make, or cause to be made, an election under Section 338(g)
of the Code (and analogous provisions of state or local Law) (collectively,
such federal and analogous state or local Law elections, the " _Section 338(g)
Election_ ") with respect to the UK Transferred Company in connection with the
purchase of the UK Transferred Company pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall
(A) prepare IRS Form 8023 and all such Section 338(g) forms required as
attachments to IRS Form 8023 (and all forms under analogous provisions of
state or local Law) in accordance with applicable Tax Laws with respect to the
UK Transferred Company, (B) deliver duly completed and signed copies of such
forms and related documents (the " _Section 338(g) Forms_ ") to Seller at the
Closing and (C) timely file the Section 338(g) Forms with the relevant Tax
Authority.

 



 

(iii) Each of Buyer and Seller shall provide the other with such information
and records, and make such of its officers, directors, employees and agents
available, as may reasonably be requested by such other party in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return or the conduct of any Tax Proceeding of
the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or a Straddle Period. 

 



 

(iv) The parties agree to treat the sale and purchase of the interests of the
U.S. Transferred Company as a taxable purchase by Buyer of all of the assets,
and an assumption by Buyer of all of the liabilities, of the U.S. Transferred
Company for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 7.08. _Ancillary Agreements._ At the Closing, (a) the Transferred
Companies and their Subsidiaries and Seller shall enter into, execute and
deliver the Assignment and Assumption Agreement in respect of the Transferred
Contracts, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Assignment and Assumption Agreement_ "), and (b) Buyer and U.S. Seller shall
enter into, execute and deliver the Transition Services Agreement,
substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Transition Services
Agreement_ ").

 



 

SECTION 7.09. _Post-Closing Operation of the Business_. (a) From and after the
Closing Date, Buyer will have the power and right to control the business and
operations of Buyer (including the Transferred Companies and the Business) in
its discretion; _provided_ that such business and operations shall be
conducted using the good faith, reasonable business judgment of the officers,
directors and other executives of Buyer consistent with reasonably prudent
business practices; _provided further_ , that Buyer will not take any action
intended to reduce or eliminate the amount of any Earn-Out Payments to which
Seller would otherwise be entitled.

 



 

(a) Within 15 days of the Initial Earn-Out Measurement Date, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Initial Earn-Out Statement_ ") setting
forth the Qualified MFLMS Customers as of the Initial Earn-Out Measurement
Date, if any, and the aggregate percentage of MFLMS Gross Sales attributable
to such Qualified MFLMS Customers. Within 15 days of the Final Earn-Out
Measuring Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Final Earn-
Out Statement_ " and, together with the Initial Earn-Out Statement, the "
_Earn-Out Statements_ ") setting forth (i) the Qualified MFLMS Customers as of
the Final Earn-Out Measuring Date, if any, and the aggregate percentage of
MFLMS Gross Sales attributable to such Qualified MFLMS Customers, (ii) the
Qualified VA/LI Customers as of the Final Earn-Out Measuring Date, if any, and
the aggregate percentage of VA/LI Gross Sales attributable to such Qualified
VA/LI Customers and (iii) any Earn-Out Payments to which Seller is entitled.

 



 

(b) During the 30-day period after Buyer's delivery of the applicable Earn-Out
Statement, Seller shall be permitted to review the MFLMS Agreements, VA/LI
Agreements and any books and records of the Buyer relating to the calculations
of the aggregate percentage of MFLMS Gross Sales attributable to Qualified
MFLMS Customers or the aggregate percentage of VA/LI Gross Sales attributable
to Qualified VA/LI Customers, as applicable. Unless Seller notifies Buyer
prior to the end of such 30- day period of any objection (an " _Earn-Out
Notice of Objection_ ") to the calculation of such aggregate percentages or
the Earn-Out Payments to which Seller is entitled, the applicable Earn-Out
Statement shall become final and binding. Any Earn-Out Notice of Objection
shall specify in writing in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any
objections.

 



 

(c) If Buyer properly delivers an Earn-Out Notice of Objection to Buyer within
such 30- day period, Buyers and Seller shall schedule an in-person meeting, if
reasonably feasible, at a mutually acceptable location or shall schedule one
or more conference calls to address Seller's objections, and Buyer and Seller
shall endeavor in good faith to resolve Seller's objections included in the
Earn-Out Notice of Objection during the 30-day period commencing on the date
Buyer receives the Earn-Out Notice of Objection. If Seller, on the one hand,
and Buyer, on the other hand, are able to resolve all objections included in
the Earn-Out Notice of Objection within such 30-business day period, then the
parties shall revise the Earn-Out Statement to reflect such resolution and the
Earn-Out Statement, as so revised, shall become final and binding. If Seller,
on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, are unable to resolve all
objections in the Earn-Out Notice of Objection within such 30-day period, then
the parties shall be entitled to rely on the provisions of Article X hereto to
resolve such dispute.

 



 



 

 



   



 

ARTICLE VIII _ 

Employees_

 



 

SECTION 8.01. _Employee Benefits Matters._ (a) From and after the date of
this Agreement until the Closing Date, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, the parties shall consult one another and mutually agree
before distributing any communications to any Employee of the Business whether
relating to employee benefits, post-Closing terms of employment or otherwise.
Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, each party shall provide the
other party with advance copies of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment
on, all such communications. Seller shall, from the date of this Agreement
until the Closing Date, provide all reasonable assistance to Buyer or its
Affiliates in facilitating access to the Employees of the Business and, to the
extent applicable, their appropriate representatives.

 



 

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, as of the date of this
Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list on _Schedule 8.01(b)_
containing an identification number together with full and accurate details of
the date of hire, position, location, and base salary, wage rate and bonus
opportunity, as applicable, of each individual identified by Seller as
expected to be an Employee of the Business, and Seller shall update such
information periodically prior to the Closing Date to reflect new hires,
leaves of absence and employment terminations, changes in base salary, wage
rate or bonus opportunity and any other material changes thereto and provide
copies of such updated lists and information to Buyer. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
to Buyer and its Affiliates all personnel records relating to Transferred
Employees at the Closing, and will deliver any remaining such personnel
records to Buyer and its Affiliates as soon as practicable thereafter, but in
no event later than ten (10) business days following the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) In the event the employment of an Employee of the Business does not
automatically transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates upon the occurrence of the
Closing by operation of Law or pursuant to the transfer of the Transferred
Equity Interests to Buyer, not less than 10 business days prior to the
Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates will offer employment, effective at
12:01 a.m., local time, on the Closing Date (the " _Transfer Time_ "), to such
Employee of the Business in accordance with this Agreement. Offers pursuant to
this Section 8.01(c) shall (i) be for a comparable position at the same or a
nearby geographic work location, in each case, to those as of the Closing
Date, (ii) be sufficient to avoid statutory, contractual, common Law or other
severance obligations, (iii) contain such restrictive covenants regarding the
protection of confidential information, non-competition and non-solicitation
of customers and employees as Buyer shall determine in its reasonable
discretion, subject to applicable Law, and (iv) otherwise comply in all
material respects with applicable Law (including with respect to compensation
and benefits). With respect to any individual who would otherwise be an
Employee of the Business to whom Buyer or one of its Affiliates would be
required to make an offer of employment pursuant to this Section 8.01(c), but
who, as of the Closing Date, is on short-term disability or long-term
disability leave (each, an " _Inactive Employee_ "), such individual shall
become an Employee of the Business upon return to work with Seller and its
Affiliates, and Buyer shall offer employment to such individual on the
earliest practicable date following such return and otherwise on terms and
conditions consistent with this Section 8.01; _provided_ that such employee
returns to work within 180 days following the Closing Date or such later time
as required by applicable Law upon presenting himself or herself for duty to
the Business. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of the occurrence and end of
any such leave of absence. In the case of any Inactive Employee who becomes a
Transferred Employee following the Closing Date, all references in this
Agreement to (A) the Closing Date shall be deemed to be references to the date
on which such individual becomes a Transferred Employee and (B) the Transfer
Time shall be deemed to be references to 12:01 a.m., local time, on the date
that such individual becomes a Transferred Employee.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) Seller and Buyer intend that the Transactions should not constitute a
separation, termination or severance of employment of any Employee of the
Business prior to or upon the occurrence of the Transfer Time, including for
purposes of any Business Employee Benefit Plan that provides for separation,
termination or severance benefits, and that such employee will have continuous
and uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the
Transfer Time, and Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, comply with any requirements under applicable Law to ensure the
same. To the extent Seller or its Affiliates terminates effective as of the
Closing Date (or such later date required by applicable Law) the employment of
any Employee of the Business to whom Buyer or its Affiliates makes an offer of
employment pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and such Employee of the Business
rejects such offer of employment and does not become a Transferred Employee on
the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates shall indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates for the severance payments set forth on _Schedule 8.01(d)_ paid to
such Employee of the Business by Seller and its Affiliates.

 



 

(d) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, for the one-year period
immediately following the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates: (i) shall
provide to each such Transferred Employee no less favorable base salary or
hourly wage rates, as applicable, than the base salary or hourly wage rates
(but excluding any incentive opportunities) provided by Seller and its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date and employee benefits under
plans, programs and arrangements that will provide benefits (excluding any
defined benefit pension, retiree welfare, incentive, equity or transaction-
based compensation or benefits) to such Transferred Employee that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the benefits (excluding any defined benefit
pension, retiree welfare, incentive, equity or transaction-based compensation
or benefits) provided by Parent or its Affiliates to similarly situated
employees of Parent; and (ii) shall provide an office within a commute of no
more than 50 miles from his or her office as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that if a relocation beyond that
distance is required and such employee's employment terminates during such
period as a result of his or her desire not to accept such a relocation, such
employee shall receive the severance benefits at the level set forth in
Section 8.01(f)(ii), subject to Section 8.01(f)(iii). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be construed as
requiring either Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of
any U.S. Transferred Employee for any period after the Closing Date;
_provided_ that such employee shall receive any severance benefits otherwise
due under Section 8.01(f)(ii), subject to Section 8.01(f)(iii).

 



 



 

 



   



 

(e) (i)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth
on _Schedule_ _8.01(o)(ii)_ , from and after the Transfer Time, Buyer shall,
or shall cause its Affiliates to, assume, honor and continue during the one-
year period immediately following the Closing Date or, if later, until all
obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all employment, severance,
retention, termination and change in control agreements set forth on _Schedule
8.01(f)(i)_ with any Transferred Employee, in each case, immediately prior to
the Closing Date, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights
arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in combination with
any other event), without any amendment or modification, other than any
amendment, or modification required to comply with applicable Law.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to U.S. Transferred Employees
terminated by the Buyer or its Affiliates during the one-year period
immediately following the Closing Date (other than for cause), Buyer or its
Affiliates shall provide severance benefits to each such Transferred Employee
that are substantially similar, in the aggregate to the severance or
termination benefits provided under Parent's severance plan, program, policy
or practice (whether contractual or otherwise) to similarly situated employees
of Parent or its Affiliates.

 



 

(ii) With respect to any Transferred Employee terminated during the one-year
period immediately following the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and, in the case of any Non-U.S. Transferred Employee where
severance payments or benefits offered are in excess of the Non-U.S.
Transferred Employee's legal minimum entitlement, Buyer or its applicable
Affiliate shall receive from each such Transferred Employee who becomes
entitled to receive any severance payments or benefits in connection with such
termination an executed and irrevocable release of claims in favor of Buyer,
its Affiliates and predecessors prior to the payment of such severance.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(f) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, effective from and after the
Transfer Time, Buyer or its Affiliates shall (i) recognize, for all purposes
(other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan, retiree
welfare benefits or with respect to any equity-based compensation) under all
plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates for the benefit of such Transferred Employees, service with Seller
and its Affiliates prior to the Transfer Time to the extent such service was
recognized under the corresponding Business Employee Benefit Plan covering
such Transferred Employees, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit levels and, except as provided above, accruals, in each case, except
where it would result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) waive any pre-
existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period
under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans established or
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing condition, exclusion,
requirement or waiting period would have applied to such individual under the
corresponding Business Employee Benefit Plan, and (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or
similar payments made or incurred prior to the Transfer Time for the plan year
in which the Closing occurs.

 



 

(g) No later than the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish, cause to be
established, or modify at its own expense, all necessary retirement, pension,
employee welfare and employee benefit plans for Transferred Employees, as
applicable, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates from any liabilities, obligations, commitments,
claims and losses incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to any
delay in establishing such plans. Effective as of the Transfer Time, each
Transferred Employee shall cease to be an employee of Seller or the applicable
Affiliate and shall cease to participate in any Business Employee Benefit Plan
(other than any Assumed Benefit Plan) as an active employee. Seller shall be,
or shall cause its Affiliates to be, responsible for all (i) medical, vision,
dental and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred
Employee or his or her dependents and (ii) claims for group life, travel and
accident, disability and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits
incurred by any Transferred Employee, in each case, on or prior to the
Transfer Time pursuant to any Business Employee Benefit Plan that is not an
Assumed Benefit Plan. Buyer shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be,
responsible for all (A) medical, vision, dental and prescription drug claims
for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee or his or her dependents and
(B) claims for group life, travel and accident, disability and accidental
death and dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any Transferred
Employee, in each case, after the Transfer Time or, solely in respect of any
Assumed Benefit Plan, at any time prior to, on or after the Transfer Time.
Except in the event of any claim for workers compensation benefits, for
purposes of this Agreement, the following claims and liabilities shall be
deemed to be incurred as follows: (1) medical, vision, dental and/or
prescription drug benefits (including hospital expenses), upon provision of
the services, materials or supplies comprising any such benefits and (2) life,
accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance, and
disability benefits, upon the death, illness, injury or accident giving rise
to such benefits. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all
claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred prior to the
Transfer Time by any Transferred Employee. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be
responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred
on or after the Transfer Time by any Transferred Employee. A claim for workers
compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event giving
rise to the claim (the " _Workers Compensation Event_ ") occurs. If the
Workers Compensation Event occurs over a period both preceding and following
the Transfer Time, the claim shall be the joint responsibility and liability
of Seller and Buyer and shall be equitably apportioned between Seller and
Buyer based upon the relative periods of time that the Workers Compensation
Event transpired preceding and following the Transfer Time.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(h) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.01(h), effective as of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, have in effect
one or more 401(k) Plans (collectively, " _Buyer 401(k) Plans_ ") providing
benefits as of the Closing Date to the U.S. Transferred Employees
participating in any Business Employee Benefit Plan that is a 401(k) Plan
(collectively, " _Seller 401(k) Plans_ ") as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall
permit each U.S. Transferred Employee participating in a Seller 401(k) Plan to
effect, and Buyer agrees to cause an appropriate Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept,
in accordance with applicable Law, a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account balances (including
earnings thereon through the date of transfer and promissory notes evidencing
all outstanding loans) under the applicable Seller 401(k) Plan if such
rollover to the applicable Buyer 401(k) Plan is elected in accordance with
applicable Law by such U.S. Transferred Employee, subject to each of Seller's
and Buyer's reasonable satisfaction that the applicable Seller 401(k) Plan or
Buyer 401(k) Plan, as applicable, is in compliance with all applicable Laws
and that such plan continues to satisfy the requirements for a qualified plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust that forms a part of such
plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code.

 



 

(i) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.01(h), Buyer shall, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates to, have in effect as of the Closing Date one or
more Cafeteria Plans (collectively, the " _Buyer Cafeteria Plans_ ") that
provide benefits to U.S. Transferred Employees. Buyer shall, or shall cause
one of its Affiliates to, cause the Buyer Cafeteria Plans to accept a spin-off
of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts from Seller's Cafeteria Plans
(collectively, the " _Seller Cafeteria Plans_ ") and shall honor and continue
through the end of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs the
elections made by each U.S. Transferred Employee under the Seller Cafeteria
Plans in respect of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts that are in
effect immediately prior to the Transfer Time. As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
cause to be transferred from the Seller Cafeteria Plans to the Buyer Cafeteria
Plans the excess, if any, of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the
flexible spending reimbursement accounts made during the year in which the
Closing Date occurs by U.S. Transferred Employees over the aggregate
reimbursement payouts made for such year from such accounts to such employees.
If the aggregate reimbursement payouts from the flexible spending
reimbursement accounts under the Seller Cafeteria Plans made during the year
in which the Closing Date occurs to U.S. Transferred Employees exceed the
aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts for such year by such
employees, Buyer shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, cause such
excess to be transferred to Seller as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume and be solely
responsible for all valid claims by U.S. Transferred Employees under the
Seller Cafeteria Plans during the year in which the Closing Date occurs,
whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have not been
paid in full as of the Closing Date.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8.01 to the contrary,
with respect to each Non-U.S. Transferred Employee, for the one-year period
immediately following the Closing Date, or such longer period required by
applicable Law, Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide to such employees (i)
terms and conditions of employment (including seniority and other service
credit) that individually, are no less than as required by applicable Law, and
in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided by Seller and its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Transfer Time and (ii) amounts (and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, types) of compensation and benefits
(excluding any defined benefit pension, retiree welfare, or transaction-based
compensation benefits) that, individually, are no less than as required by
applicable Law and, in the aggregate, are comparable to those provided by
Parent and its Affiliates to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Affiliates.

 



 

(k) If any Employee of the Business requires a work permit or employment pass
or other legal or regulatory approval for his or her employment with Buyer and
its Affiliates, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass or other
approval to be obtained and in effect prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, in the event an
applicable work permit, pass or other approval for an Employee of the Business
is not in place with Buyer or its Affiliates as of the Closing, such Employee
of the Business shall remain employed by Seller following the Closing Date and
the parties shall reasonably cooperate to provide for the services of such
Employee of the Business to be made available exclusively to Buyer and its
Affiliates through a transition services or similar arrangement (in Seller's
discretion) under which Buyer shall be responsible for all the economic costs
of such individual's compensation and benefits (including reimbursement for
any expenses incurred by such Employee of the Business, all applicable fees,
Taxes and other amounts owed to third parties and all applicable social or
national insurance contributions) for such service period until the applicable
work permit can be obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, continue to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the applicable work permit, pass or other approval. Such
Employee of the Business' Transfer Time shall be the date that such Employee
of the Business commences employment with Buyer and its Affiliates, which
shall occur as soon as practicable following the date that the relevant pass
or other approval has been obtained.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(l) If it is found or alleged that the employment of any employee of Seller
and its Affiliates who is not a Transferred Employee should have transferred
to Buyer and its Affiliates by operation of Law, then Seller or the relevant
Affiliate may give notice to dismiss such person.

 



 

(m) Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law or expressly
provided otherwise in this Section 8.01, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, with respect to each Transferred Employee, effective as of the
Transfer Time, assume all liabilities for (i) all earned or accrued but unused
vacation benefits of such Transferred Employee with Seller and its Affiliates
that are included in Current Liabilities determined as of the Closing Date
(ii) the portion of any severance, retirement or termination indemnity
payments, long-service awards, 13th or 14th month salaries set forth on
_Schedule 8.01(n)_ that are attributable to such Transferred Employee's
service prior to the Transfer Time, (iii) any other liabilities that are
attributable to such Transferred Employee's service prior to the Transfer Time
and that are included in Current Liabilities determined as of the Closing Date
and (iv) all employment, labor, compensation and employee benefits related
obligations, commitments, claims and losses relating to such U.S. Transferred
Employee that are included in Current Liabilities or set forth on _Schedule
8.01(n)_ and all employment, labor, compensation and employee benefit related
obligations, commitments, claims and losses relating to such U.K. Transferred
Employee (other than with respect to any Listed Plan that is not an Assumed
Benefit Plan) (collectively, the " _Assumed HR Liabilities_ "). As of the
Transfer Time, Seller and its Affiliates shall be relieved of all Assumed HR
Liabilities, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Where
required by applicable Law, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
pay out all earned or accrued but unused vacation benefits to the Transferred
Employees as soon as administratively practicable following the Transfer Time.

 



 

(n) (i) Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide each
Transferred Employee listed on _Schedule 8.01(o)(i)_ with a cash incentive
opportunity in respect of such Transferred Employee's annual bonus under the
annual bonus plans of Seller and its Affiliates in respect of Seller's fiscal
year 2016 equal to such Employee's Fiscal Year 2016 Bonus in accordance with
the terms set forth on such Schedule.

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, (x) provide each
Employee of the Business listed on _Schedule 8.01(o)(ii)_ who becomes a
Transferred Employee with one or more cash payments in accordance with the
terms set forth in _Schedule 8.01(o)(ii)_ and (y) provide each Employee of the
Business listed on _Schedule 8.01(o)(iii)_ who becomes a Transferred Employee
with one or more cash payments in accordance with the terms set forth in
_Schedule 8.01(o)(iii)_.

 



 

(o) The provisions contained in this Article VIII shall be binding upon and
inure to the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and nothing in this
Article VIII, express or implied, shall create any right or remedies of any
nature whatsoever in any other person, including any Employee of the Business
(or dependent or beneficiary of any of the foregoing). Nothing herein shall
prohibit Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates from amending,
modifying or terminating, or shall be deemed an amendment or modification of
any plan, programs, policies, practices, arrangements sponsored or maintained
by Seller, Buyer, any of the Transferred Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates, including each Business Employee Benefit Plan, and, except as
provided in Section 8.01(f), nothing in this Agreement shall require Seller,
Buyer, any of the Transferred Companies or any of their respective Affiliates
to continue any particular compensation or benefit plan, program, policy,
practice, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date or to continue to
employ any particular person.

comply with any of Seller's covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or (ii) any one or more of the representations or warranties of
Seller contained in this Agreement shall prove to have been inaccurate when
made and, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), such failure or inaccuracy
would be reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in
Sections 5.01(a) or 5.01(b) not being satisfied as of the Closing Date, and
Buyer shall have given Seller a reasonable opportunity to cure any such
failure or inaccuracy (if curable) to so comply on or prior to the Outside
Date; (b) at the Closing, if any of the conditions precedent to the
performance of Buyer's obligations at the Closing shall have become incapable
of fulfillment; or (c) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the
Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may only terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the preceding clauses (a), (b) or (c) if at the time of
termination Buyer is not in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 9.03. _Seller Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated by
Seller: (a) at any time prior to the Closing, if (i) Buyer shall have failed
to comply with any of Buyer's covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or (ii) any one or more of the representations or warranties of

would be reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in
Section 5.02(a) or Section 5.02(b) not being satisfied as of the Closing Date,
and Seller shall have given Buyer a reasonable opportunity to cure any such
failure or inaccuracy (if curable) to so comply on or prior to the Outside

Agreement pursuant to the preceding clauses (a), (b) or (c) if at the time of
termination Seller is not in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or (d) if (x)
all the conditions set forth in Section 5.01 and Section 5.02 shall have been
satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which shall
reasonably be expected to be satisfied at the Closing) and (y) Buyer fails to
consummate the Closing within three business days following the date on which
the Closing was required to occur pursuant to Section 2.01; _provided_ that
any termination of this Agreement by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.02(c) shall
be deemed a termination pursuant to this Section 9.03(d) if prior to the time

of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents
(collectively, the " _Seller Related Parties_ " and the " _Buyer Related
Parties_ ", respectively)), except that the obligations in Section 6.03(e) and
Section 7.03 with respect to confidentiality and the provisions of this
Section 9.04 and Article XI will survive any termination of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for damages incurred or suffered by any other party as a result of
any fraud, willful misconduct or willful breach of any covenant contained in
this Agreement. Buyer Related Parties and Seller Related Parties are expressly
intended as third party beneficiaries of this Section 9.04. For the avoidance
of doubt, the failure of a party to consummate the Closing if and when
required by the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall constitute a
willful breach.

SECTION 10.02. _Indemnification by Seller._ (a) In addition to the
indemnification set forth in Section 10.04(a), Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and
representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") against and from
any and all damages (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel
and other advisors) which any Buyer Indemnitee may incur or suffer to the
extent such damages arise out of or result from:

 



 

(i) subject to Section 10.01, any breach of any Fundamental Representation;

 



 

(ii) subject to Section 10.01, any breach of any Pre-Closing Covenant;

 



 

(iii) any breach of any Post-Closing Covenant made or to be performed by
Seller pursuant to this Agreement; and

 



 

(iv) the Rhetorik Transfer.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding that a claim for damages may fall into multiple categories
of this Section 10.02 or Section 10.04(a), a Buyer Indemnitee may recover such
damages one time only. Buyer acknowledges that a failure to mitigate any
damages may result in a lesser recovery under New York common law with respect
to an indemnity claim in a breach of contract action.

 



 

SECTION 10.03. _Indemnification by Buyer._ (a) In addition to the
indemnification set forth in Sections 6.04(e), 8.01 and 10.04(c), Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller against and from any and all damages

and representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") may incur or
suffer to the extent such damages arise out of or result from:

 



 

(i) subject to Section 10.01, any breach of any representation or warranty of
Buyer set forth in Section 4.01(a) and

 



 

(ii) any breach of any Post-Closing Covenant made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding that a claim for damages may fall into multiple categories
of Sections 6.04(e), 8.01, this Section 10.03 or Section 10.04(c), a Seller
Indemnitee may recover such damages one time only. Seller acknowledges that a
failure to mitigate any damages may result in a lesser recovery under New York
common law with respect to an indemnity claim in a breach of contract action.

 



 

SECTION 10.04. _Tax Indemnification._ (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this
Section 10.04, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer Indemnitees
against and from any and all damages (including reasonable fees and expenses
of legal counsel and other advisors) which any Buyer Indemnitee may incur or
suffer to the extent such damages arise out of or result from, without
duplication, (i) any Taxes of the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) any Taxes relating to the Rhetorik
Transfer.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(a) Seller shall not indemnify or hold harmless Buyer Indemnitees against
damages that arise or result from (i) Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is
responsible pursuant to Section 2.07(a), (ii) Taxes to the extent directly
attributable to any action taken or failure to act by Buyer outside of the
ordinary course of Business on the Closing Date after the Closing, unless any
such action or failure to act is expressly permitted by this Agreement or
(iii) Taxes attributable to a breach by Buyer or its Affiliate of any of its
covenants or agreements in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller Indemnitees against and
from any and all damages (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel) which any Seller Indemnitee may incur or suffer to the extent such
damages arise out of or result from, without duplication, (i) any Taxes of the
Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries, other than (x) any such Taxes
that Seller must indemnify or hold harmless Buyer Indemnitees against or from
under Section 10.02 or Section 10.04(a) and (y) any such Taxes already
recovered by any Seller Indemnitees under Section 717 of the Corporation Tax
Act 2010 (and Seller Indemnitees shall procure that no recovery is sought
under Section 717 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 to the extent that indemnity
has been made under this Section 10.04(c)) and (ii) any Taxes described in
Section 10.04(b).

 



 

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period:

 



 

(i) Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real, personal and intangible
property Taxes) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are
in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the Straddle Period; and

 



 

(ii) Taxes (other than Taxes described in Section 10.04(d)(i)) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be computed (1) as if such taxable period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date and (2) in the case of any such
Taxes attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in a partnership or
other "flowthrough" entity as if the taxable period of that entity ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 10.05. _Claims._ Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming it
may be entitled to indemnification under this Article X (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") shall give prompt written notice to the other party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") of each matter, action, cause of action, claim,
demand, fact or other circumstances upon which a claim for indemnification (a
" _Claim_ ") hereunder may be based. Such notice shall contain, with respect
to each Claim, such facts and information as are then reasonably available,
including the estimated amount of damages and the specific basis for
indemnification hereunder. Failure to give prompt notice of a Claim hereunder
shall not affect the Indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 10.06. _Defense of Actions._ The Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's option and expense, to assume
the complete defense of any Claim based on any action, suit, proceeding,
claim, demand or assessment by any third party with full authority to conduct
such defense and to settle or otherwise dispose of the same and the
Indemnified Party will fully cooperate in such defense; _provided_ the
Indemnifying Party will not, in defense of any such action, suit, proceeding,
claim, demand or assessment, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), consent to the entry of any
Judgment or enter into any settlement (a) which provides for any relief other
than the payment of monetary damages and/or (b) which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the third-party claimant to the
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect thereof. After
notice to the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party's election to assume
the defense of such action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the Indemnified Party only for such
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof at the request of the Indemnifying Party.
As to those third-party actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands or
assessments with respect to which the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
assume control of the defense, the Indemnified Party will afford the
Indemnifying Party an opportunity to participate in such defense, at its cost
and expense, and will reasonably consult with the Indemnifying Party prior to
settling or otherwise disposing of any of the same. The Indemnified Party will
not settle any Claim without the prior consent of the Indemnifying Party, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

SECTION 10.07. _Limitation, Exclusivity, No Duplicate Recovery._ Except in the
case of actual fraud no Claim shall be made or have any validity unless the
Indemnified Party shall have given written notice of such Claim to the
Indemnifying Party prior to the date set forth in Section 10.01 for such
Claim. Following Closing, this Article X provides the exclusive means by which
a party may assert and remedy claims of any nature whatsoever relating to the
Transactions (other than disputes related to the purchase price adjustment or
purchase price allocation, which shall be governed by the terms of Section
2.04 and Section 2.06, respectively, claims pursuant to Section 11.06(b) and
the Excluded Matters), including any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and Section 11.12 provide
the exclusive means by which a party may bring actions against the other party
under or with respect to this Agreement. Each party hereby waives and releases
any other remedies or claims that it may have against the other party (or any
of its Affiliates) following the Closing with respect to the matters arising
out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, the Transactions
or the Transferred Equity Interests except that any limitations herein shall
not apply (i) for the remedies of injunctive relief or specific performance
set forth herein; (ii) in the event of actual fraud, as to which the parties
shall have all remedies available at Law or in equity; (iii) with respect to
the covenants that by their respective terms anticipate performance following
the Closing Date, (iv) as otherwise expressly provided in any Ancillary
Agreements and (v) to any claims under or in respect of Section 11.17 (the "
_Excluded Matters_ "). With respect to any damages arising under this
Agreement, Buyer agrees that it shall only seek such damages from Seller, and
Buyer hereby waives the right to seek damages from or equitable remedies, such
as injunctive relief, against any Seller Related Party. If an Indemnified
Party is indemnified for any damages pursuant to this Agreement with respect
to any Claim by a third party, then the appropriate Indemnifying Party will be
subrogated to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party against such
third party, and such Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate with and
assist the Indemnifying Party in asserting all such rights and remedies
against such third party. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled
to indemnification under this Article X with respect to any amount to the
extent that such amount was reflected in the calculation of the adjustment to
the Closing Payment, if any, pursuant to Section 2.03.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 10.08. _Calculation of Damages._ Except as otherwise provided in this
Article X, in any case where the Indemnified Party subsequently recovers from
third parties any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an
Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to this Article X, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount
so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses
incurred by it in procuring such recovery and any related increase in
insurance premiums), but not in excess of any amount previously so paid by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
matter. The computation of the amount of any indemnity payment required to be
made pursuant to this Article X shall be reduced by the amount of the Tax
benefit (other than a U.S. Tax benefit), if any, actually realized by the
Indemnified Party as a result of incurring the liability at issue, _provi_ _d_
_ed_ that, if such Tax benefit is determined after the applicable indemnity
payment is made pursuant to this Article X, the Indemnified Party shall repay
to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that
the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this Article X
had such determination been made at the time of such payment.

 



 

SECTION 10.09. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments._ Any indemnity payment
under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Closing Payment
for Tax purposes unless there is no reasonable basis for doing so under the
applicable Tax Law.

Miscellaneous_

 



 

SECTION 11.01. _No Reliance by Buyer; Own Due Diligence._ Buyer is has
conducted its own investigation, examination and valuation of the Business,
the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries and the Transferred Equity
Interests, in effecting the transactions covered by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents. Buyer has made all inspections and investigations
of the Business and the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries deemed
necessary or desirable by Buyer. Buyer is purchasing the Transferred Equity
Interests based on the results of its inspections and investigations, and not
on any representation or warranty of Seller or any of its Affiliates not
expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by
Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement. In light of these
inspections and investigations and the representations and warranties made to
Buyer by Seller herein, Buyer is relinquishing any right to any claim based on
any representations and warranties other than those expressly set forth in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered to Seller or its Affiliates
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 11.02. _Financial Information and Projections; No Other
Representations or Warranties._ (a) In connection with Buyer's investigation
of the Business, Buyer has received from Seller various forward-looking
statements regarding the Business and the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries (including the estimates, assumptions, projections, forecasts and
plans furnished to it) (the " _Forward-Looking Statements_ "). Buyer
acknowledges and agrees (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make the Forward-Looking Statements; (ii) Buyer is familiar with such
uncertainties; (iii) Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own
investigation, examination and valuation of the Business and has employed
outside professionals to assist it with the foregoing; (iv) Buyer is taking
full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy
of all Forward-Looking Statements; (v) Buyer is not relying on any Forward-
Looking Statement in any manner whatsoever and (vi) with respect to the
foregoing, Buyer shall have no claim against Seller or any of its Affiliates,
except in the case of fraud.

 



 

(a) Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying any Forward-Looking Statement.

 



 

(b) Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to any Forward-
Looking Statement made (i) in the Management Presentation, (ii) in the Data
Room, (iii) in any supplemental due diligence information provided or made
available to Buyer, (iv) in connection with Buyer's discussions with
management of the Business, (v) in negotiations leading to this Agreement or
(vi) in any other circumstance.

 



 

(c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that except for the representations and
warranties contained in Article III, none of Seller or the Transferred
Companies nor any other Person makes or shall be deemed to make any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document, the Business, the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries, the Transferred Equity Interests, the Transactions or any other
matter and any other representations and warranties are hereby disclaimed.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that no
representation or warranty has been made or is being made as to
merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose, or quality,
with respect to any tangible assets or as to the condition or workmanship
thereof or the absence of any defects therein, whether latent or patent. Buyer
agrees that the representations and warranties contained in Article III by
Seller are in lieu of, and Buyer hereby expressly waives all rights to, any
implied warranties that may otherwise be applicable because of the provisions
of the Uniform Commercial Code or any other statute, including the warranties
of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 11.03. _To the knowledge._ "To the knowledge of Seller" or other
references to the knowledge or awareness of Seller or its Affiliates means the
actual knowledge, after reasonable due inquiry, of those individuals set forth
on _Schedule 11.03_.

 



 

SECTION 11.04. _Waivers._ At any time and from time to time prior to the
Closing, the parties hereto may by written agreement signed by both parties,
(a) extend the time for, or waive in whole or in part, the performance of any
obligation of any party hereto under this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracy
in any representation, warranty or statement of any party hereto or (c) waive
any condition or compliance with any covenant contained in this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 11.05. _Modifications and Amendments._ This Agreement shall not be
altered or otherwise amended except pursuant to an instrument in writing
executed and delivered by each of the parties hereto. In addition, none of
this Section 11.05 nor Sections 11.06(a), 11.12 or 11.15 may be amended,
modified or waived in a manner adverse to the providers of Debt Financing or a
Debt Financing Commitment without the consent of such Person.

 



 

SECTION 11.06. _Assignability, Beneficiaries, Governing Law and Enforcement._
(a) This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective
successors and permitted assigns, but this Agreement shall not be assignable
by either party hereto without the express written consent of the other party
hereto, which will not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ that, at any time
at or after the Closing, Buyer shall have the right to assign all or certain
provisions of this Agreement, or any interest herein, without the consent of
Seller to any of the financial institutions providing the Debt Financing, as
collateral; _provided_ _further_ , without such consent, either Seller or
Buyer may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate at any
time, or to a third party in connection with a sale or transfer (by means of a
merger, stock sale or otherwise) of all or substantially all of Seller's or
Buyer's respective business; _provided_ _further_ , in the case of an
assignment to an Affiliate, no such assignment will limit Seller's, Parent's
or Buyer's obligations hereunder, as applicable. Other than as explicitly set
forth herein, including in Section 10.02 and Section 10.03, nothing contained
herein is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. Each provider of Debt Financing
or a Debt Financing Commitment is an express third party beneficiary with
respect to Sections 11.05, 11.12 or 11.16 or this Section 11.06(a). This
Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of New York without
reference to the choice of law doctrine of such state.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
may not have any adequate remedy at law if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement without
proof of actual damages, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
any party is entitled at law or in equity. Each party further agrees that (i)
no other party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 11.06, and each party hereto
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument and (ii) it will not oppose
the granting of such remedy.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, it
is explicitly agreed that the right of Seller to obtain an injunction, or
other appropriate form of equitable relief, to cause the Buyer or Parent to
complete the Closing (but not the right of Seller to obtain an injunction, or
other appropriate form of equitable relief, for any other reason) at any time
shall be subject to the requirement that (i) Buyer is required to complete the
Closing pursuant to Sections 2.01 and 2.10, (ii) the Debt Financing has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing or all conditions set forth in the
Debt Financing have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms cannot be satisfied prior to the Closing, which shall be reasonably
expected to be satisfied at Closing), (iii) Buyer fails to complete the
Closing in accordance with Sections 2.01 and 2.10 and (iv) Seller has
irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and Debt
Financing is funded, then the Closing pursuant to Section 2.01 will occur.

 



 

SECTION 11.07. _Notices._ Any notice, request, instruction or other

proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern

not have jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York state
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York. Consistent
with the preceding sentence, the parties hereto hereby (i) submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York or any state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of
The City of New York for the purpose of any action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement brought by any party hereto and (ii) irrevocably waive, and
agree not to assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such
action, any claim that they are not subject personally to the jurisdiction of
the above-named courts, that their property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that the action is brought in an inconvenient forum,
that the venue of the action is improper or that this Agreement or the
transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

 



 

(a) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER, EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS
RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY.

any other party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied
or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

 



 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 11.15. _Severability._ It is the desire and intent of the parties
hereto that the provisions of this Agreement will be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible under the Laws in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is

unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof

otherwise) for any obligations of the parties hereto or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the parties hereto hereby waive any such claim or right against any such non-

hereof. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer Obligations are the
joint and several obligations of Buyer and Parent. If Buyer shall default in

injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section
