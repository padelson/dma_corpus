Section 1.5 _Effect of the Merger on Shares of NYSE Euronext and Merger Sub_.

(a) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of NYSE
Euronext, Merger Sub, or the holder of any capital stock of NYSE Euronext or
Merger Sub, at the Effective Time:

(i) each share of NYSE Euronexts common stock, par value $0.01 per share
(each, a " _NYSE Euronext Share_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any NYSE Euronext Share owned directly by
NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ OMX, ICE or Merger Sub and in each case not held on
behalf of third parties (each, an " _Excluded Share_ ") or any Dissenting

_ICE Stock Consideration_ ") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock of ICE, par value $0.01 (each, an "
_ICE Share_ "), and (z) 0.4069 (the " _NASDAQ OMX Stock Consideration_ " and
together with the ICE Stock Consideration, the " _Stock Consideration_ ") of a
validly issued, fully paid 

 



4  and non-assessable share of common stock of NASDAQ OMX, par value $0.01
(each, a " _NASDAQ OMX Share_ ") (clauses (x), (y) and (z), collectively, the

Shares, the NASDAQ OMX Shares or ICE Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into NYSE Euronext Shares, NASDAQ OMX Shares or ICE Shares, as applicable),
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger
Consideration will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide to
the holder of such NYSE Euronext Share the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;

(ii) each share of common stock of Merger Sub owned by NASDAQ OMX, the Class
A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Class A Stock_ "), issued

converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $[0.01] per share, of the Surviving
Corporation;

(iii) each share of common stock of Merger Sub owned by ICE, the Class B
Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Class B Stock_ "), issued and

assessable share of ICE Newco common stock, par value $[ _ _] per
share (the " _ICE Newco Shares_ "); and

(iv) each Excluded Share shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled
and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist.

remain outstanding and all NYSE Euronext Shares shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist. Each entry in the records of NYSE Euronext or its transfer
agent formerly representing NYSE Euronext Shares (the " _Book-Entry Interests_
") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (other than with
respect to the Excluded Shares and the Dissenting Shares) the Merger
Consideration and any distribution or dividend pursuant to Section 2.1(d).
From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of NYSE
Euronext Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

NYSE Euronext Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article I, as appropriate.

 

Section 1.6 _Effect of the Merger on NYSE Euronext Stock Options and Awards_.1

 



   1  |

NASDAQ OMX and ICE are amenable to alternative treatment of stock option and
awards, including conversion into NASDAQ OMX and ICE stock options
and awards, as applicable. 

---|--- 
 



5 (a) Each option to purchase NYSE Euronext Shares (a " _NYSE Euronext
Stock Option_ ") granted under the [insert list of stock plans] of NYSE
Euronext (the " _NYSE Euronext Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, promptly following the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number
of NYSE Euronext Shares subject to the NYSE Euronext Stock Option multiplied
by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Cash Value of the Merger Consideration (as
defined below) over the option exercise price. " _Cash Value of the Merger
Consideration_ " means the aggregate cash value of the sum of (i) the
Cash Consideration, (ii) the ICE Stock Consideration multiplied by the
average closing sale price of one ICE Share for the five (5) most recent
trading days that ICE Shares have traded ending on the last day prior to the
Closing Date, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange and (iii) the NASDAQ
OMX Stock Consideration multiplied by the average closing sale price of one
NASDAQ OMX Share for the five (5) most recent trading days that NASDAQ OMX
Shares have traded ending on the last day prior to the Closing Date, as
reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Markets (the " _NASDAQ_ ").

 

(b) At the Effective Time, subject to the last sentence of this Section
1.6(b), each restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit measured in NYSE
Euronext Shares (each, a " _NYSE Euronext Stock-Based Award_ ") granted under
the NYSE Euronext Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the number of NYSE Euronext Shares subject to such NYSE
Euronext Stock-Based Award multiplied by (ii) the Cash Value of the
Merger Consideration. All NYSE Euronext Stock-Based Awards that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall (i) to the extent
unvested, vest as of the Effective Time, and (ii) be paid out promptly
following the Effective Time;  _provided_ that, with respect to any such NYSE
Euronext Stock-Based Awards that constitute deferred compensation within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
" _Code_ "), such payment shall occur on the date that the NYSE Euronext
Shares underlying such NYSE Euronext Stock-Based Awards would be delivered
under the applicable award agreement absent the application of this Section
1.6(b).

 

(c) The obligations to make the payments under Section 1.6(a) shall be
obligations of: (i) NASDAQ OMX to the extent the NYSE Euronext Stock Option
is held by a current or former employee of a NYSE Euronext business that is
retained by NASDAQ OMX; or (ii) ICE to the extent the NYSE Euronext Stock
Option is held by a current or former employee of a NYSE Euronext business
that is retained by ICE. The obligations to make the payments under Section
1.6(b) shall be obligations of: (i) NASDAQ OMX to the extent the NYSE Euronext
Stock-Based Award is held by a current or former employee of a NYSE Euronext
business that is retained by NASDAQ OMX; or (ii) ICE to the extent the NYSE
Euronext Stock-Based Award is held by a current or former employee of a NYSE
Euronext business that is retained by ICE. For purposes of this Section
1.6(c), the determination of which NYSE Euronext business a former employee
was associated with shall be based on the NYSE Euronext business that employed
such former employee immediately prior to such former employees
termination from NYSE Euronext.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, NYSE Euronext shall take all necessary action
to implement the provisions under this Section 1.6.

 



6 Section 1.7 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the
extent available under the DGCL, NYSE Euronext Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
holders of NYSE Euronext Shares who shall have neither voted in favor of the
Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly
in writing appraisal for such NYSE Euronext Shares in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.
Such NYSE Euronext stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
fair value of such NYSE Euronext Shares held by them in accordance with the
provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by
holders of NYSE Euronext Shares who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
NYSE Euronext Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have
been cancelled and to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, in
accordance with 1.5(a).

(b) NYSE Euronext shall give NASDAQ OMX and ICE (i) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by NYSE Euronext, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by NYSE
Euronext and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. NYSE Euronext shall not,
except with the prior written consent of each Parent (which consent may be
withheld by either Parent for any reason whatsoever or for no reason, in such
Parents sole and absolute discretion), make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

(c) Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled under Section 262 of
the DGCL to payment for such Dissenting Shares shall receive payment therefor
after the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation (but only after the
amount thereof shall have been agreed upon in writing by the Surviving
Corporation or finally determined pursuant to such Section 262), and such
Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and retired.

ARTICLE II.

 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

Section 2.1 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parents shall appoint
[ _ _] or another bank or trust company that is reasonably
satisfactory to NYSE Euronext to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of NYSE Euronext Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
cash, NASDAQ OMX Shares and ICE Shares contributed to Merger Sub pursuant to
Section 4.13. In addition, NASDAQ OMX or ICE, as the case may be, shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the
Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(d) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable

 



7  pursuant to Section 2.1(e). All NASDAQ OMX Shares, ICE Shares, cash,
dividends and distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.1 shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

(b) _Transmittal Letter_. NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ OMX and ICE shall cause
appropriate transmittal materials (the " _Transmittal Letter_ ") to be
provided by the Exchange Agent to holders of record of NYSE Euronext Shares
(other than holders of Excluded Shares) as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger and
the procedure for providing instructions to the Exchange Agent to effect the
transfer and cancellation of Book-Entry Interests in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. The Transmittal Letter shall contain such other terms and
conditions as NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ OMX and ICE may reasonably specify.

 

(c) _Merger Consideration_. After the Effective Time, and upon delivery to the
Exchange Agent of instructions authorizing transfer and cancellation of Book-
Entry Interests in accordance with the terms of the Transmittal Letter and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Book-Entry Interests shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and the Exchange Agent shall be required to deliver to each such
holder (subject to Section 2.1(g)), (i) the number of NASDAQ OMX Shares and
ICE Shares and an amount in cash in respect of the aggregate
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 1.5(a)(i) (after taking into account all NYSE Euronext Shares then
held by such holder), and (ii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(e). The Book-Entry
Interests that are the subject of such authorization shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon such
transfer and cancellation of any Book-Entry Interests. The Stock
Consideration issued and paid and the Cash Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this Section 2.1(c) upon conversion of any NYSE Euronext
Shares (including any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such NYSE Euronext Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of any NYSE Euronext Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of NYSE Euronext, the proper number of
NASDAQ OMX Shares, ICE Shares and the proper amount in cash may be transferred
by the Exchange Agent to such a transferee if written instructions authorizing
the transfer of the Book-Entry Interests are presented to the Exchange Agent,
in any case, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be delivered to a
Person other than the holder in whose name any Book-Entry Interests are
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other similar
Taxes required by reason of the transfer of NASDAQ OMX Shares or ICE Shares
or the payment of the Cash Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of any Book-Entry Interests, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
NASDAQ OMX and ICE or the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is

OMX Shares and $[] of the Cash Consideration and ICE for delivery of any ICE
Shares and $[] of the Cash Consideration, and to NASDAQ OMX and ICE, as

this Agreement, the compliance by it with all of the provisions of and the
performance by it of its obligations under this Agreement, nor the

Law applicable to it, except (in each of clauses (i) and (ii), as applicable)
for such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults, payments, accelerations,

under applicable Law) under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in
good standing when taken together with all other such failures, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on ICE. Each of ICE and its Subsidiaries has all

Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding. ICE does not have outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to

the right to vote) with the stockholders of ICE on any matter.

 

(c) _Corporate Authority_. ICE has all requisite corporate power and authority
and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to authorize, execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and to consummate

pay the aggregate ICE Stock Consideration required to be paid by ICE in
connection with the Merger by a vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding ICE Shares entitled to vote thereon (the " _ICE Requisite Vote_
"), and (ii) to the extent required, to approval of the SEC or other

applicable Law, to recommend that the ICE stockholders authorize the issuance
of the ICE Stock Consideration in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration required to be paid by ICE in connection with the Merger.

 

(d) _No Conflicts_. (i) Neither the execution and delivery by ICE of this
Agreement, the compliance by it with all of the provisions of and the
performance by it of its obligations under this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions herein contemplated will
conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of, or result in
any acceleration of any rights or obligations or the payment of any penalty
under or the creation of a Lien on the assets of ICE or any of its
Subsidiaries (with or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time)
pursuant to, or permit any other party any improvement in rights with

 



26  respect to or permit it to exercise, or otherwise constitute a default
under, any provision of any Contract, or result in any change in the rights or
obligations of any party under any Contract, in each case to which ICE or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which ICE or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective assets is bound, (ii) nor, assuming that the ICE

and other actions described in Section 3.3(e) have been obtained, all filings
and notifications described in Section 3.3(e) have been made and any
applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated, will such
execution and delivery, compliance, performance or consummation result in any
breach or violation of, or a default under, the provisions of the
Organizational Documents of ICE or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Law
applicable to it, except (in each of clauses (i) and (ii), as applicable) for
such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults, payments, accelerations,
creations or changes that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
are not reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on ICE.

(e) _Governmental Approvals and Consents_. Other than (i) the Competition
Approvals, (ii) the approvals and consents to be obtained from the SEC or any
other Governmental Authority, and (iii) as required in order to comply with

registrations, qualifications and exemptions of, with or from, or other
actions are required to be made by ICE or any of its Subsidiaries with, or
obtained by ICE or any of its Subsidiaries from, any Governmental Entity in
connection with the execution and delivery by ICE of this Agreement, the
performance by ICE of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(f) _Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(i) The ICE Reports were filed in a timely manner and in material compliance

requirements under applicable Law regarding the accuracy and completeness of
the disclosures contained therein.

(ii) The consolidated balance sheet (including the related notes and
schedules) included in the audited consolidated financial statements of ICE
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 (the " _ICE Financial Statements_

Subsidiaries as of its date, and the consolidated statements of income,
equity, and cash flows and of changes in financial position included in the
ICE Financial Statements (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
present the results of operations, equity, cash flows and changes in

ICE.

proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to any Taxes or Tax
Return of ICE or any of its Subsidiaries; (D) the Tax Returns of ICE and each

applicable statutes of limitations for the assessment of income Taxes for such

2008, and no deficiencies were asserted as a result of such examinations which

any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. law) in the two years prior
to the date of this Agreement; (G) neither ICE nor any of its Subsidiaries has

law), as transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise; (H) there are no

annual financial statement, and (I) no private letter rulings, technical
advice memoranda or similar agreements or rulings have been entered into or
issued by any Tax Authority with respect to ICE or any of its Subsidiaries
for any taxable year for which the statute of limitations has not expired.

(k) _Financing_. ICE has delivered to NYSE Euronext a true and complete fully
executed copy of the commitment letter, dated as of April 19, 2011 among ICE
and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Bank
of America, N.A., and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated (the
" _ICE Financing Sources_ "), including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and
amendments to such letter in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_ICE Commitment Letter_ ", together with the NASDAQ OMX Commitment Letter,
the " _Commitment Letters_ ") and the provision of such funds as set forth in
the ICE Commitment Letter, the " _ICE Financing_ ", together with the NASDAQ
OMX Financing, the " _Financing_ "), pursuant to which and subject to the

restated or otherwise modified or waived prior to the date of this Agreement,

been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect prior to the date of
this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the ICE Commitment Letter is
in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of ICE, as applicable and, to the knowledge of ICE, the
ICE Financing Sources. Subject to the terms and conditions of the ICE
Commitment Letter, assuming the accuracy of NYSE Euronexts representations
and warranties contained in Section 3.1(b) and assuming compliance by NYSE
Euronext in all material respects with its covenants contained in Article IV,
the net proceeds contemplated from the ICE Financing, together with other
financial resources of ICE, including cash on hand and marketable securities
of ICE on the Closing Date, will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of the obligations of ICE under this Agreement, including
the payment of any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article II and of
all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection
herewith. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) (assuming the accuracy of NYSE
Euronexts representations and warranties contained in Section 3.1(g)) no
event has occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time or both)
would constitute a breach or default, in each case, on the part of ICE under
the ICE Commitment Letter or, to the knowledge of ICE, any of the ICE
Financing Sources, and (ii) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
contained in Section 5.1, ICE has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the ICE Financing will not be satisfied or that the ICE
Financing or any other funds necessary for the satisfaction of all of the
obligations of ICE under this Agreement and of all fees and expenses
reasonably expected to be incurred in connection herewith will not be
available to ICE on the Closing Date. ICE has fully paid all commitment fees
or other fees required, as applicable, to be paid prior to the date of this
Agreement pursuant to the ICE Commitment Letter.

the Exchange Act, (B) after complying with Section 4.2(d), determine either to
make no recommendation for the Merger, the issuance of NASDAQ OMX Shares or
the issuance of ICE Shares, respectively, or to withdraw, modify or qualify
any such recommendation in a manner that is, in the case of NYSE Euronext,
adverse to any of Parents or Merger Sub, or, in the case of either NASDAQ
OMX or ICE, adverse to NYSE Euronext (with respect to NYSE Euronext such
determination not to make a recommendation or any such withdrawal,
modification or qualification, a " _Change in NYSE Euronext Recommendation_ ",

any such withdrawal, modification or qualification, a " _Change in NASDAQ OMX
Recommendation_ ", with respect to ICE such determination not to make a

Vote, and (z) in the case of ICE, prior to the receipt of the ICE Requisite
Vote, engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information or data to, any Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, if and only to the extent
that, (i) in the case of clause (B) above, (x) if such Change in NYSE Euronext
Recommendation, Change in NASDAQ OMX Recommendation or Change in ICE
Recommendation, as applicable, is made in response to an Acquisition Proposal,
then such Acquisition Proposal shall have been an unsolicited bona fide

 



35  written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the NYSE Euronext
Board, NASDAQ OMX Board or ICE Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) if such Change in NYSE Euronext
Recommendation, Change in NASDAQ OMX Recommendation or Change in ICE
Recommendation, as applicable, is not made in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, then the NYSE Euronext Board, NASDAQ OMX Board or ICE
Board, as applicable, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,

Recommendation, Change in NASDAQ OMX Recommendation or Change in ICE
Recommendation, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, (ii) in the case of clause (C) above, (1) the NYSE
Euronext Board, NASDAQ OMX Board or ICE Board, as applicable, concludes in

action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,

(e) In the event that a third party who has previously made an Acquisition
Proposal that the NYSE Euronext Board, NASDAQ OMX Board or ICE Board, as
applicable, has determined in accordance with this Section 4.2 is a Superior
Proposal subsequently modifies or amends in an adverse manner any material
term of such Superior Proposal such that the Acquisition Proposal is no longer
a Superior Proposal, then such boards prior determination shall be null and
void and it shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4.2(c) and (d) in
all respects (including the obligation to deliver a new NYSE Euronext Change
in Recommendation Notice, NASDAQ OMX Change in Recommendation Notice or ICE
Change in Recommendation Notice, as applicable, and negotiate in good faith

applicable, or 50% or more of the assets of NYSE Euronext and its
Subsidiaries, NASDAQ OMX and its Subsidiaries, or ICE and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, each on a consolidated basis, on terms that the NYSE Euronext
Board, NASDAQ OMX Board or ICE Board, as applicable, in good faith concludes

the party making such proposal to obtain financing for such Acquisition
Proposal) are more favorable to the stockholders of NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ OMX
or ICE, as applicable, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after taking into account any such improved terms).

to sell, by NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ OMX or ICE or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as the case may be, of any of their respective
assets or businesses), if such action would, individually or in the aggregate,

regulatory structure of NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ OMX or ICE or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or in any of their respective operations

applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, NYSE Euronext,
NASDAQ OMX or ICE shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

Effective Time, (i) to sell, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of,
or to agree to sell, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, assets,
businesses or subsidiaries, or (ii) to take or refrain from taking, or to
agree to take or to refrain from taking, any actions that, in each of cases
(i) and (ii), would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to materially impair the value of the combined businesses of NYSE Euronext,
NASDAQ OMX or ICE after the Effective Time (taking into account NASDAQ OMXs
and ICEs contemplated plans for combining such businesses after the Effective
Time and any value which is reasonably expected to be realized in connection

Section 4.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For the one-year period beginning on the Effective Time (the " _Benefit
Continuation Period_ "), NASDAQ OMX or ICE, as the case may be, shall provide
or cause to be provided to each individual who is employed as of the Effective
Time by NYSE Euronext and its Subsidiaries and who remains employed by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries or ICE Newco and its Subsidiaries
(such employees collectively, the " _Affected Employees_ ") (i) base salary in
an amount no less than the base salary provided to the Affected Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual bonus opportunity
that is no less favorable than the annual bonus opportunity provided to the
Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) other
compensation opportunities and employee benefits that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than those provided to the Affected Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
during the Benefit Continuation Period, (x) NASDAQ OMX or ICE, as the case may
be, shall provide or cause to be provided to each Affected Employee who
suffers a termination of employment by the Surviving Corporation or ICE Newco,
as applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, severance benefits in
amounts and on terms and conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to
such Affected Employee than such Affected Employee would have received under
the severance plans, programs, policies and arrangements applicable to such
Affected Employee as of the date hereof, and (y) defined contribution
retirement plan benefits provided to Affected Employees no less favorable to
Affected Employees than such benefits on the date hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of this Section 4.11(a) shall not apply with
respect to Affected Employees whose employment is governed by a collective
bargaining or similar agreement.

 



45 (b) Prior to the end of the Benefit Continuation Period, NASDAQ OMX or ICE, as
the case may be, shall review, evaluate and analyze NYSE Euronext Benefit
Plans with a view towards developing appropriate new Benefit Plans for
Affected Employees. It is the intention of NASDAQ OMX and ICE, to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws, to develop new Benefit Plans, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, which, among other things,
(A) treat similarly situated Affected Employees on a substantially equivalent
basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic
location, tenure, qualifications, and abilities, and (B) do not discriminate
between Affected Employees who were covered by NYSE Euronext Benefit Plans, on
the one hand, and those covered by NASDAQ OMX or ICE Benefit Plans, on the
other, at the Effective Time.

(c) With respect to any Benefit Plans in which any Affected Employees first
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which
such Affected Employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ "), NASDAQ OMX or ICE, as the case may be, shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries (subject to applicable Law and applicable tax qualification
requirements) to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Affected Employees and their eligible dependents under any
New Plans in which such Affected Employees may be eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous NYSE Euronext
Benefit Plan; (ii) provide each Affected Employee and his or her eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time under a NYSE Euronext Benefit Plan (to the same extent that
such credit was given under the analogous NYSE Euronext Benefit Plan prior to
the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans in which such Affected Employee may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time for the same plan year; and
(iii) recognize all service of the Affected Employees with NYSE Euronext and
their respective Affiliates for all purposes (including, purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting credit, entitlement to benefits) in any
New Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, including any severance plan, to the extent such service is
taken into account under the applicable New Plan (to the extent recognized
under the corresponding NYSE Euronext Benefit Plan Benefit Plan); provided
that the foregoing shall not apply for purposes of benefit accrual under final
average pay defined benefit plans or to the extent it would result
in duplication of benefits.

(d) Subject to Section 4.11(a), no provision of this Section 4.11 shall be
construed as a limitation on the right of NASDAQ OMX, ICE, and their
Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any specific NYSE Euronext Benefit Plan
that NYSE Euronext would otherwise have under the terms of such NYSE Euronext
Benefit Plan or shall any provision of this Section 4.11 be construed to
require the continuation of the employment of any particular Affected
Employee. The provisions of this Section 4.11 are solely for the benefit of
the Parties, and no current or former director, officer, employee or
independent contractor or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary
of this Section 4.11, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to
any NYSE Euronext Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan
or arrangement for any purpose.

 



46 (e) NYSE Euronext shall consult with each other in a good faith and in a
reasonably timely manner in advance of any material communications with
Affected Employees regarding the impact of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement on the NYSE Euronext Benefit Plans or the New Plans, as the
case may be.

 

Section 4.12 _Financing_.

(a) NASDAQ OMX and ICE shall each use its respective reasonable best efforts

written notice (but in any event not later than two (2) Business Days after

becomes aware, or any termination of the NASDAQ OMX Commitment Letter or ICE

NYSE Euronext a termination fee equal to $350,000,000 (the " _Reverse
Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same day funds (which fee shall be
payable within two (2) Business Days after written notice of such

(viii) In the event that NYSE Euronext receives the Reverse Termination

suffered or incurred by NYSE Euronext, any of NYSE Euronexts subsidiaries,
Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination thereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the

further liability or obligation to NYSE Euronext relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



60 (d) _Interest_. Each of NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ OMX and ICE acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 6.5 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the other Parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if any Party fails to promptly pay or cause to be paid the
amount due pursuant to this Section 6.5, and, in order to obtain such payment,
any other Party commences a suit that results in a judgment against such Party
for the payment set forth in this Section 6.5 or any portion of such payment,
such Party shall pay any other Party its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the

was required through the date of actual payment. In no event shall NYSE
Euronext be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.5 to pay more than one NYSE
Euronext Termination Payment and in no event shall NASDAQ OMX or ICE be
obligated pursuant to this Section 6.5 to pay more than one Parent Termination
Payment. In no event shall NASDAQ OMX or ICE be obligated pursuant to

Party to receive such notice as provided above.

Section 7.8  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits
hereto), the NYSE Euronext Disclosure Letter, the NASDAQ OMX Disclosure Letter
and the ICE Disclosure Letter, and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated [ _
_], between (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral, among the Parties, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

Section 7.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section
4.9 ( _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_), this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer any rights or remedies hereunder upon
any Person other than the Parties who are signatories hereto, and the
Financing Parties, which shall benefit from the provisions in Section
6.5(c)(viii), the last sentence of Section 7.5(b) and Section 7.5(c). The
Parties further agree that the rights of third-party beneficiaries under
Section 4.9 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.

 

Section 7.10 _Obligations of NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ OMX and ICE; Action by the
Parents_. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of NYSE Euronext,
NASDAQ OMX and ICE to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking

 



64  on the part of NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ OMX or ICE, as appropriate, to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action. The Parties agree that the obligations of
the Parents under this Agreement shall be several and not joint and that the
failure of one Parent to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement
shall not result in any losses, liabilities, damages, claims, awards,
judgments, costs or expenses of the other Parent in connection with such
failure, except for the Reverse Termination Fee to the extent provided in
Section 6.5(c)(vii) and the last sentence of Section 6.5(d).

Section 7.11 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the Party upon which
such Taxes are imposed; _provided_ that any transfer taxes with respect to
interests in real property owned, directly or indirectly, by NYSE Euronext or
any of its subsidiaries shall be borne equally by NASDAQ OMX and ICE and
expressly shall not be a liability of the stockholders of NYSE Euronext.

Section 7.12  _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex VII_ is
defined on the page of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

Section 7.13 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 7.14 _Interpretation; Construction_.

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of, a Schedule to or an Exhibit
to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The term "knowledge of NYSE
Euronext" shall be deemed to mean the actual knowledge of the individuals set
forth on _Schedule II_. The term "knowledge of NASDAQ OMX" shall be deemed to
mean the actual knowledge of the individuals set forth on _Schedule III_. The
term "knowledge of ICE" shall be deemed to mean the actual knowledge of the
individuals set forth on _Schedule IV_.

 

(b) Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all references to currency,
monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall mean United States (U.S.)
dollars, "$" refers to United States dollars and all payments hereunder shall
be made in United States dollars by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to such account as shall have been specified in writing by the
recipient thereof.

 



65 (c) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

Section 7.15 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other
Parties. Any attempted or purported assignment in violation of the preceding
sentence shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever. Subject to the
preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 

Section 7.16 _Specific Performance_. Subject to the last sentence of this
Section 7.16, the Parties acknowledge and agree that each of the Parties
would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached and that any non-performance or breach of this Agreement by
any Party could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone and
that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly,
subject to the last sentence of this Section 7.16, the Parties shall be
entitled, prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VI, to seek enforcement of any provision of this Agreement by a decree
of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any provisions of this
Agreement without posting any bond or undertaking. In addition to any other
right or remedy to which NASDAQ OMX and ICE may be entitled, at law or in
equity (including monetary damages), each of NASDAQ OMX and ICE shall be
entitled to enforce NYSE Euronexts obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the
Merger), in each case, if the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) or waived. The Parties hereto further agree that
they shall not object to the granting of injunctive or other equitable relief
on the basis that there exists adequate remedy at law. The Parties further
acknowledge and agree that NYSE Euronext shall not be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to enforce specifically the obligations of either
NASDAQ OMX or ICE to consummate the Merger contemplated by this Agreement.

 



66 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the Parties as of the date first written above.
