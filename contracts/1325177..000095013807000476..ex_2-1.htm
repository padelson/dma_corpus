liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At the Effective
Time, ( _a_ ) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation

of Merger Sub naming its incorporator shall be omitted and ( _b_ ) the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall by virtue of the Merger be amended so as to

advancement of expenses, exculpation and indemnification provisions contained
in the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation in effect from and

Effective Time, shall not ( _i_ ) be any less favorable in any respect than
those contained in the Companys Constituent Documents as of the date hereof
and ( _ii_ ) contain any provision inconsistent with the provisions of Section
6.9(a).

  

Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub and the officers of the Company (other than those who
Merger Sub determines shall not remain as officers of the Surviving
Corporation), in each case, as of the Effective Time, shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation.

virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (such shares, collectively, the " _Company Common Stock_ ", and each,

Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive in cash an amount per
Share (subject to any applicable withholding Tax specified in Section 2.2
hereof) equal to $34.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate
theretofore representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such certificates in accordance with Section
2.1(b), without interest.

  

(c) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company, or otherwise
owned by Parent or Merger Sub, or owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary

be canceled without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be paid
with respect thereto.

Section 1.7

  |  

_Treatment of Options, Warrants and Notes_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to by Parent
and a holder of an Option with respect to such holders Options, each Option,
whether vested or unvested, will be canceled and extinguished, and the holder
thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the excess (if
any) of ( _i_ ) the product of ( _A_ ) the number of Shares subject to such
Option and ( _B_ ) the Merger Consideration, minus ( _ii_ ) the aggregate
exercise price of such Option, without interest and less any required
withholding Taxes as specified in Section 2.2 hereof. All payments with
respect to canceled Options shall be made by the Paying Agent (or such other
agent reasonably acceptable to Parent as the Company shall designate prior to
the Effective Time) promptly after the Effective Time from funds deposited by
or at the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in
accordance with Section 2.1. Prior to the Effective Time, as reasonably
directed by Parent, the Company shall take any and all actions necessary to
effectuate this Section 1.7(a); _provided_ , however, that no action taken by
the Company or any holder of Options shall be required to be irrevocable until
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(b) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to by Parent
and a holder of a Warrant with respect to such holders Warrants, each Warrant
will either be (i) converted into the right to receive, upon exercise of such
Warrant, the Merger Consideration the holder of such Warrant would have been
entitled to receive upon consummation of the Merger if such holder had been,
immediately prior to the Merger, the holder of the number of Shares then
issuable upon exercise in full of the Warrant, or ( _ii_ ) if agreed to by the
Company and the Warrant holder with respect to such holders Warrant, canceled
and extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive,
following exercise or cancellation, as the case may be, an amount in cash
equal to the excess (if any) of ( _A_ ) the product of ( _x_ ) the number of
Shares subject to such Warrant and ( _y_ ) the Merger Consideration, minus (
_B_ ) the aggregate exercise price of such Warrant, without interest and less
any required withholding Taxes as specified in Section 2.2 hereof. All
payments with respect to canceled Warrants shall be made by the Paying

Agent (or such other agent reasonably acceptable to Parent as the Company
shall designate prior to the Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at the
direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in accordance with
Section 2.1. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all
actions reasonably necessary to effectuate this Section 1.7(b), including
providing holders of Warrants with notice of their rights with respect to any
such Warrants as provided herein; _provided_ , that no action taken by the
Company or any holder of Warrants shall be required to be irrevocable until
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, the outstanding principal amount and
accrued and unpaid interest then owing under each Note will be prepaid in
full. All such prepayments will be made concurrently with the Effective Time,
either ( _i_ ) pursuant to the terms of the Note, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company to the
borrower or by certified bank check delivered to the Company or ( _ii_ ) if
agreed to by the Company and the borrower with respect to such borrowers
Note, which agreement the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, by the surrender from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to
the borrower the outstanding amount of principal and interest with respect to
any Note. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all
actions reasonably necessary to effectuate this Section 1.7(c), including
providing borrowers under the Notes with notice of their rights and
obligations with respect to any such Notes; _provided_ , however, that no
action taken by the Company or any holder of Notes shall be required to be
irrevocable until immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

Section 1.8 _Adjustment of Merger Consideration_. If, between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Shares
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reclassification, redenomination, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and as
so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence.

_Appraisal Shares_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by holders of Shares who have not voted in
favor of or consented to the Merger and who have properly demanded and
perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders
thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of
the DGCL; _provided_ , however, that if any such stockholder of the

Company shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose
such stockholders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholders
Appraisal Shares in respect of which the stockholder would otherwise be
entitled to receive fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

  



  

(b) The Company will give Parent ( _i_ ) prompt notice of any notice
received by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any Shares,
withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company and ( _ii_ ) the
opportunity to direct and participate at its expense in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to the exercise of dissenters rights under Section
262 of the DGCL. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any
such exercise of dissenters rights or offer to settle or settle any such
rights or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

  

ARTICLE II

  

PAYMENT AND EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; WITHHOLDING

        



  |  

Section 2.1

  |  

_Payment and Exchange of Certificates_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) Following the date of this Agreement and in any event not less
than three (3) Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
the stockholders of the Company, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in
connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
deposit in trust with, the Paying Agent, the aggregate consideration to which
stockholders, holders of Options and holders of Warrants become entitled
pursuant to Article I. Until used for that purpose, the funds shall be
invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America
or obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or in deposit accounts, certificates of
deposit or bankers acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase
agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks,
each of which has capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than
$500,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of the banks which
are then publicly available at the SEC or otherwise).

  

(b) Promptly and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each Person who was a record holder of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the

  



  

6

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

Effective Time, whose shares were converted pursuant to Article I into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, ( _i_ ) a form of letter of
transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of stock certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in order to receive payment of the Merger
Consideration (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon actual delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), and shall otherwise be in customary form) and ( _ii_ ) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares, together with a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal
and any other required documents, the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the
holder of the Shares represented by the Certificate (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, or as otherwise directed in the
letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration with regard to each Share
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, less any required Tax
withholdings in accordance with Section 2.2 below, and the Certificate shall
be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment
is to be made to a Person holding a Certificate other than the Person in whose
name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered must be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the Person who surrenders the
Certificate must provide funds for payment of any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of the surrendered Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that all Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
After the Effective Time, a Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, without any interest
thereon.

  



  

(c) If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to accept an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed instead of the Certificate; _provided_ , that the Surviving
Corporation may require the Person to whom any Merger Consideration is paid,
as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, to give the Surviving
Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct or otherwise indemnify the
Surviving Corporation in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.

  

(d) At any time which is more than one (1) year after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any

  



  

7

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

funds which had been deposited with the Paying Agent and have not been
disbursed in accordance with this Article II (including interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of the funds made available to
it), and after the funds have been delivered to the Surviving Corporation,
Persons entitled to payment in accordance with this Article II shall be
entitled to look solely to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates held by them, without any
interest thereon; _provided_ , that such Persons shall have no greater rights
against the Surviving Corporation than may be accorded to general creditors of
the Surviving Corporation under applicable Laws. Any portion of the funds
deposited with the Paying Agent remaining unclaimed as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or the Paying Agent will be liable to any Person entitled to
payment under this Article II for any consideration which is delivered to a
public official or Governmental Entity pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(e) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall not record on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation any transfers of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares are presented for transfer, they shall be canceled and treated as
having been surrendered for the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares
represented thereby.

  

Section 2.2 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, awards granted
under the Company Incentive Plans, Warrants or any other equity rights in the
Company such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state or local Law or the Laws of
any other domestic or foreign jurisdiction, and shall be required to withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any employee or former employee
the amount of principal and interest outstanding with respect to any Note
which is not otherwise prepaid by the employee or former employee who is the
borrower thereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to
the appropriate taxing authority by Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

Except ( _i_ ) as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of
the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent on or prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being
agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
section or subsection to which the relevance of such disclosure to the
applicable representation and warranty is reasonably apparent), or ( _ii_ ) as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed or furnished and publicly
available on EDGAR on or after March 9, 2007 and prior to the date hereof
(other than disclosures in the sections titled "Risk Factors" and "Forward-
Looking Statements" of such Company SEC Documents), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as of the date hereof (except to the extent
such representation and warranty is made only as of a specific date, in which
event such representation and warranty is made as of such specific date) as
follows:

  

Section 3.1 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have all corporate,
partnership or other similar powers and all governmental licenses,

and approvals required to carry on their business as now conducted (the "
_Company Permits_ "), except for those powers, licenses, authorizations,
permits, consents, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals the
absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Company
Permits, except where the failure to be in such compliance would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company is duly qualified to do business as
a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is required, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be
so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has
made available to Parent true and complete copies of the Constituent Documents
of the Company and each Company Subsidiary as currently in effect. The Company
is not in violation in any material respect of the provisions of its
Constituent Documents, nor is any of the Company Subsidiaries in violation in

Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder Vote is the only vote of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of the Company necessary to adopt this
Agreement or approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

Section 3.3 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the

filings included on Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule that are
required to be made following the consummation of the Merger, the " _Company
Approvals_ "), and ( _vi_ ) any other consents, approvals or filings the
absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

benefit to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is entitled under any
Material Contract or ( _iv_ ) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
on any asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for such
violations, conflicts and breaches referred to in clause (ii) and for such
failures to obtain any such consent or other action, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations, changes, losses or Liens referred to in clauses
(iii) and (iv) that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or prevent,

  |  

_Subsidiaries_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) Each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or other legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of formation. Each such Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to
do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where failure to be
so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All Significant
Subsidiaries (as defined in Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) of the
Company and their respective jurisdictions of formation are identified as such
in the Company SEC Documents.

  

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other voting

reinsurer in its jurisdiction of incorporation, ( _ii_ ) duly licensed or
authorized as an insurance company and, where applicable, a reinsurer in each

( _iii_ ) duly authorized in its jurisdiction of incorporation and each other
jurisdiction where it is required to be so authorized to write each line of
business reported as being written in its most recent Company SAP Statement,
except, in each case, where the failure to be so licensed or authorized would

Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All of the Company Permits of Company
Subsidiaries conducting insurance operations are in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms and there is no proceeding or investigation to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is subject before a Governmental
Entity that is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
relating to the revocation, failure to renew, limitation, suspension or
restriction of any such Company Permits, except where the failures to be in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms, revocations, failures to
renew, limitations, suspensions or restrictions would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date hereof a
list of all market conduct examinations pending as of the date hereof by an
insurance regulatory Governmental Entity relating to any Company Subsidiary.

---|---|--- 
  

(a) The Company has filed all required forms, reports, statements,
schedules, registration statements and other documents required to be filed by
it with the SEC since May 3, 2005 (the documents referred to in this Section
3.8(a) collectively with any other forms, reports, statements, schedules,
registration statements or other documents filed with the SEC subsequent to
the date hereof, the " _Company SEC Documents_ ").

  

(b) As of its filing date, each Company SEC Document complied, and
each such Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will
comply, as to

  



  

13

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be.

  



  

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC
Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act did not, and each such Company SEC
Document filed subsequent to the date hereof on the date of its filing will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the
date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments from the SEC
staff with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents.

  

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act,
as of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading.

  

(e) Each required form, report and document containing financial
statements that has been filed with or submitted to the SEC by the Company
since May 3, 2005, was accompanied by the certifications required to be filed
or submitted by the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial
officer pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and, at the time of filing
or submission of each such certification, such certification was true and
accurate and complied in all material respects with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002.

  

(f) The Company maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) required by Rule 13a-15 under
the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are sufficient to
ensure that material information (both financial and non-financial) required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under
the Exchange Act is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the Companys
management to allow the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of the Company, or individuals performing similar functions,
to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and
procedures prior to the date hereof, to its independent auditors and the
audit committee of its Board of Directors ( _i_ ) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and ( _ii_ ) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees of the Company who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. The Company
has made available to Parent prior to the date hereof any such disclosure made
by management to the Companys independent

  



  

14

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
within the twelve (12) month period preceding the date of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Financial Statements_. The audited consolidated
financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements
of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents fairly present in all
material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for
the periods then ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of
any unaudited interim financial statements).

  

Section 3.10 _Company SAP Statements_. As used herein, the term "
_Company SAP Statements_ " means the statutory statements of each of the
Company Subsidiaries as filed with the applicable insurance regulatory
authorities in their respective jurisdictions of incorporation for the year
ended December 31, 2006 and the quarterly period ended March 31, 2007 and any
such annual and quarterly statutory statements filed with the applicable
insurance regulatory authorities in their respective jurisdictions of
incorporation subsequent to the date hereof. Each of the Company Subsidiaries
has filed or submitted all Company SAP Statements required to be filed with or
submitted to the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities of the
jurisdiction in which it is domiciled on forms prescribed or permitted by
such authority, except for such failures to file that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. The Company SAP Statements were, and any Company SAP
Statements filed after the date hereof will be, prepared in all material
respects in conformity with SAP consistently applied for the periods covered
thereby (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and the Company SAP
Statements present, and any Company SAP Statements filed after the date hereof
will present, in all material respects, the statutory financial position of
such Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the results
of operations of such Company Subsidiaries for the respective periods then
ended. No material deficiency has been asserted with respect to any Company
SAP Statements filed prior to the date hereof by the applicable insurance
Company Subsidiarys domiciliary state regulator. The annual statutory
balance sheets and income statements included in the Company SAP Statements as
of the date hereof have been, where required by applicable Insurance Law,
audited by an independent accounting firm of recognized national or
international reputation.

  

Section 3.11 _Proxy Statement_. The Proxy Statement will, at the date
mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, and the Proxy Statement will comply as to
form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act,

  



  

15

  



  

  



  



  

 except that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with
respect to statements made therein based on information supplied by Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their representatives specifically for inclusion therein.

explicitly defined in any such Company Reinsurance Agreement, ( _ii_ ) for
each such Company Reinsurance Agreement entered into, renewed, or amended on
or after January 1, 2004, for which risk transfer is not reasonably considered
to be self-evident, documentation concerning the economic intent of the

domiciliary state insurance departments for each of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in all material respects, ( _iii_ ) each of the Company

furnished by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to independent actuaries in
connection with the preparation of the Company Actuarial Analyses were
accurate in all material respects. To the knowledge of the Company, each
Company Actuarial Analysis was based upon an inventory accurate in all
material respects of policies in force for the Company and the Company

prepared in conformity with generally accepted actuarial principles in effect
at such time (except as may be noted therein).

shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, ( _i_ ) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers,
provide any non-public information or data to any Person relating to or in
connection with a potential Takeover Proposal, or knowingly make any other
efforts or attempts that constitute, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Takeover Proposal, or engage in any discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto or otherwise knowingly cooperate with or knowingly assist or
participate in, or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations, ( _ii_ ) approve or recommend, or publicly

or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing. Subject to Section 6.3(c), on
the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any activities that would otherwise be a violation of this
Section 6.3(b) conducted theretofore by the Company or its Representatives
with respect to any Takeover Proposal, whether or not any discussions,
negotiations or other activities permitted pursuant to Section 6.3(a) prior to
the Go-Shop Period End Date were ongoing. Subject to Section 6.3(c), with
respect to parties with whom discussions or negotiations have been terminated
on or prior to the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to require such parties to promptly return or destroy in
accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement any
confidential information previously furnished by the Company.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.3(b), if at
any time following the Go-Shop Period End Date and prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Vote, ( _i_ ) the Company receives a _bona fide_ written
Takeover Proposal from any third party with which the Company was in contact
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Go-Shop Period End Date, or
an unsolicited Takeover Proposal from any other third party, and ( _ii_ ) the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that (A) such Takeover
Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, and (B) the failure to provide non-public information concerning the
Company or enter into discussions or negotiations with such third party would
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company may take the following actions: ( _x_ ) furnish information to the
Person making such Takeover Proposal, _provided_ , that ( _A_ ) prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company has received from such Person a
Qualifying Confidentiality Agreement, and ( _B_ ) all such information has
previously been provided to Parent and Merger Sub or is provided to Parent and
Merger Sub prior to

  



  

38

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

or substantially contemporaneously with the time it is provided to the Person
making such Takeover Proposal or such Persons Representatives, and ( _y_ )
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person with
respect to the Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) advise Parent orally and in writing of the
receipt following the Go-Shop Period End Date of ( _i_ ) any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal
and the material terms of such proposal, including the identity of the
Person(s) making such proposal, and, if applicable, providing copies of any
documents or correspondence evidencing such proposal, and ( _ii_ ) any request
for non-public information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related to a
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and any material
developments, discussions and negotiations concerning such Takeover Proposal
(including any material change to the terms thereof). Without limiting the
foregoing, following the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company will promptly
(within two (2) Business Days) notify Parent orally and in writing if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in negotiations
concerning a Takeover Proposal.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote, the Board of
Directors of the Company may ( _i_ ) effect a Recommendation Withdrawal and/or
( _ii_ ) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, in each case of
clause (i) and/or (ii), if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , however, that the Board of Directors of the
Company may not take any such action ( _x_ ) not in connection with a Takeover
Proposal unless the taking of such action is based on one or more events,
changes, circumstances or effects relating to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that occurs on or after the date of this Agreement and (
_y_ ) in connection with a Takeover Proposal unless the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside counsel), that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and, if such determination is made following the Go-Shop
Period End Date:

  

(A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at
least three (3) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of its
intention to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal or terminate this Agreement in
response to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Superior Proposal; and

  



  

39

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

(B) prior to effecting such Recommendation Withdrawal or terminating
the Agreement, during the Notice Period, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
financial advisors and outside counsel to, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent so desires to negotiate) to make adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside counsel) that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute
a Superior Proposal.

  

In the event of any material revisions to a Superior Proposal following the
Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
6.3(d) with respect to such new written notice. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the Company shall not be entitled to enter into any
agreement (other than a Qualifying Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to
a Superior Proposal unless this Agreement has been or is concurrently
terminated by its terms pursuant to Section 8.1, and if required pursuant to
Section 8.3, the Company has concurrently paid to Parent the Company
Termination Fee.

  

(e) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set
forth in Section 6.3(b) by any Representative of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, shall be deemed to be a breach of Section 6.3(b) by the Company.

  

(f) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from
the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the
DGCL (or any similar provisions) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to
apply, in each case, unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company
from ( _i_ ) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law
with regard to a Takeover Proposal, including Rule 14a-9, 14d-9 or 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act, ( _ii_ ) making any required disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if, after consultation with its outside counsel,
the Company determines that failure to disclose such information would
reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under applicable Law or (
_iii_ ) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in
this Section 6.3; _provided_ that any Recommendation Withdrawal may only be
made in accordance with Section 6.3(d).

the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class or series of

business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), any tender offer
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group of

exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company (or any Company Subsidiary or

whole);

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ Takeover Proposal (except that
references to 15% will be deemed to be references to "more than 50%") made in

counsel), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial and
other aspects of the Takeover Proposal and the third party making the Takeover
Proposal, is more favorable to the Companys stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any written proposal by
and binding upon Parent to amend this Agreement prior to such determination by
the Board of Directors of the Company), as amended from time to time.

  

Section 6.4 _Access to Information_. The Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, directors,
employees, general or limited partners (if applicable), managing members (if

commitments and personnel, and shall furnish, and shall cause to be furnished,
as promptly as practicable to Parent ( _a_ ) a copy of each material report,
schedule and other document filed, furnished, or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws or a
Governmental Entity (other than routine filings, correspondence, reports,

request; _provided_ that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to
those Persons (other than Persons who are "Representatives" under the

reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon advice of
counsel respecting the provision of privileged communications or any
applicable confidentiality agreement with

  



  

41

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

any Person (provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain waivers under such agreements or implement requisite
procedures to enable the provision of reasonable access without violating such
agreement). The Company shall also, with respect to each fiscal month ending
after the date of this Agreement, furnish to Parent any "flash" or "management
reports" relating to the financial and operating performance of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, and any unaudited monthly financial statements,
in each case to the extent made available to management of the Company,
promptly following their availability (it being understood and agreed that the
Company shall not be required to prepare any such reports solely for the
purpose of complying with the foregoing). In conducting any inspection of any
properties of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, Parent and its
Representatives shall not ( _i_ ) interfere with the business of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary conducted at such property, or ( _ii_ ) damage any
property or any portion thereof. All information obtained pursuant to this
Section 6.4 shall continue to be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement,
_provided_ that ( _x_ ) any requirement under the Confidentiality Agreement to

Investors shall be waived during the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and ending on any termination of this Agreement, ( _y_ ) such
Persons shall constitute "Representatives" for all purposes of

inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, ( _ii_ )
promptly inform the other party of any communication received by such party

transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any applicable Law, each of
the Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Entity or
private party may have to such transactions under such applicable Law so as to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
terms set forth in this Agreement.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than

those provided by the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary to such
employees immediately before the date of this Agreement (but excluding for all
purposes, in each case, any equity-based or long-term incentive plans or
arrangements). The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall not create in any
current or former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary any
rights to employment or continued employment with Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or any right to any specific terms or
conditions of employment. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of

Subsidiary, or to restrict the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
terminate any such employee.

  

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall ( _i_ ) waive any applicable pre-
existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or successor
welfare benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation that an employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is eligible to participate in following the
Effective Time to the extent such exclusions or waiting periods were
inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such
employee participated, ( _ii_ ) provide each such employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductible paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same
extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to
the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements and ( _iii_ ) recognize service prior to the Effective Time with
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and level of benefits (but not for any other purpose) to
the same extent such service was recognized by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries under any similar Company Benefit Plan (including vacation) in
which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in
any duplication of benefits for the same period of service, and _provided_
_further_ , that ( _x_ ) the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
provide credit for years of service for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined benefit pension plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or its

subject to applicable Law, the Company shall provide Parent with reasonable
access to such employees or former employees for purposes of Parent providing
reasonable notices or other communication materials regarding Parent
compensation and benefit plans and the matters described in this Section 6.6,
_provided_ that such notices or other communication materials are reasonably
approved in advance by the Company.

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.6,
nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, ( _i_ ) shall be treated
as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, or ( _ii_ )
shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan
following the Closing Date. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and
agree that all provisions contained in this Section 6.6 with respect to
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are included for the
sole benefit of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and that nothing herein,
whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other
rights ( _x_ ) in any other Person, including any current or former employees
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any participant in any Company
Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or ( _y_ ) to continued
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
affiliates or continued participation in any Company Benefit Plan.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the greatest
extent permitted by Law (including to the greatest extent authorized or
permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted on or after
the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may
indemnify its officers and directors), indemnify and hold harmless (and
advance reasonable expenses as incurred to the greatest extent permitted by
Law, _provided_ the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances, if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification) the present and former (and any
individuals who may become prior to the Effective Time) officers, directors
and employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any and all costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative regulatory or investigative, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any circumstances, developments or matters
in existence, or acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred,
prior to or at the Effective Time, including the approval of this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising
out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or cause to be provided
substitute policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to
purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy with respect to
circumstances, developments or matters in existence, or acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred, prior to or at the Effective Time;
_provided,_ however, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be
required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in

  



  

46

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

respect of any one (1) policy year annual premiums in excess of 250% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (which annual
premium the Company represents and warrants is set forth on Section 6.9(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule) in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided,_ further, that if the
Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder
costs more than 250% of such last annual premium (the cost of such tail
measured for these purposes by reference to 1/6th the premium paid therefor),
the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that
can be obtained for 250% of such last annual premium (the cost of such tail
measured for these purposes by reference to 1/6th the premium paid therefor).

  



  

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
( _i_ ) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or ( _ii_ ) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made prior
to any such transaction being consummated so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.9.

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, until the sixth (6th) year
anniversary thereof, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree not to,
directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate the advancement of
expenses, exculpation and indemnification provisions of the agreements listed
on Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule between the Company and
any of the Indemnified Parties, or any such provisions contained in the
Surviving Corporations Constituent Documents.

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.9 and the proviso to Section 1.4
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties. The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this
Section 6.9 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may
have under the Constituent Documents of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts, insurance policies or Laws.

no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent
of the Company and Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is
subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case, the party required to
make the release or announcement shall give the other parties as much advance
written notice as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances, to the
extent legally permissible (including, without limitation, sending such
disclosure in writing if

  



  

47

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

reasonably practicable), it being understood that the final form and content
of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release
or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party;
_provided_ , however, that the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.10
shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by
the Company pursuant to and in accordance with Section 6.3.

Section 9.3

  |  

_Interpretation_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section or
Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of or Schedule to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "hereby," "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import
refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any Schedules delivered
herewith) and not merely to the specific section, paragraph or clause in
which such word appears. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
references to "dollars" or "$" shall be deemed references to the lawful money
of the United States of America. Whenever the last day permitted for any
action under this Agreement falls on a day other than a Business Day, the
performing party shall be permitted to undertake such action on the next
Business Day. No summary of this Agreement, the Equity Commitments or the
Voting Agreements prepared by or on behalf of any party shall affect the
meaning or interpretation of any such agreement.

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

  

Section 9.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, including by facsimile, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which shall constitute one and
the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party
hereto has received counterparts thereof signed and delivered (by telecopy or
otherwise) by all of the other parties hereto.

        



  |  

Section 9.5

  |  

_Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Equity Commitments and
the Voting Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto
and thereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each party hereto, and, except, solely from and after the Effective
Time ( _i_ ) as provided in Section 6.9, ( _ii_ ) for the right of the
Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
1.6(b), ( _iii_ ) for the right of the Option holders to receive the
consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(a), and

  



  

61

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

( _iv_ ) for the right of the Warrant holders to receive the consideration to
which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(b), nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person not a party
to this Agreement any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.9(b)
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  

Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

  

Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except
that ( _i_ ) Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company in which event all
references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation and (ii) Parent may assign, in its sole
discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent without the consent of the Company, but
no such assignment shall relieve Parent of any of its obligations under this
Agreement, in which event all references herein to Parent shall be deemed
references to such Affiliate of Parent, except that all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to Parent as of the date of this Agreement
shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such
Affiliate of Parent as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any
such assignment

  



  

62

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

by Parent or Merger Sub (or any subsequent assignee) shall not prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of
the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment
in violation of this Agreement is void _ab initio_.

  



  

Section 9.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after the Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained, but after
such approval no amendment shall be made which by Law or in accordance with
the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by the
Companys stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties.

  

Section 9.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, ( _a_ ) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (
_b_ ) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and ( _c_ ) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those
rights.

        



  |  

Section 9.10

  |  

_Governing Law And Venue; Waiver Of Jury Trial_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

  

(b) In any action or proceeding between or among any of the parties
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: ( _i_ )
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits, for itself and its
property, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (or, in the case of any claim as to which the federal
courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the
United States of America, sitting in Delaware); ( _ii_ ) agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding must be commenced, and may be
heard and determined, exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, if applicable, such Federal court); ( _iii_ ) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and, if
applicable, such Federal court);

  



  

63

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

and ( _iv_ ) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, such Federal
court). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  



  

(c) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ( _I_ ) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, ( _II_ ) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF THIS WAIVER, ( _III_ ) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND ( _IV_
) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.10.

  

Section 9.11 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement to be
performed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement in
compliance with Article VIII, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches by the Company of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, which other remedy is subject to Section 8.3(g), exclusively in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the case of any claim as
to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, the
Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware), and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, in the case
of any claim as to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction, the Federal appellate court of the United States of America
sitting in Delaware). Solely for purposes of specific enforcement under this
Section 9.11, the limitations on liability set forth in Section 8.3(g) of this
Agreement were not intended to

  



  

64

  



  

  



  



  

 

  

serve as a measure of actual damage suffered hereunder. The parties
acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor
any other Person shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement other than the confidentiality provisions of Section 6.4,
and the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach of
this Agreement other than a breach of the confidentiality provisions of
Section 6.4 shall be, if and only to the extent applicable, the monetary
damages set forth in Section 8.3(d), subject to Section 8.3(f); _provided_
that the foregoing shall not prevent, impede, restrict or delay the ability of
the Company to enforce the Limited Indemnity (as defined in the Equity
Commitments).
