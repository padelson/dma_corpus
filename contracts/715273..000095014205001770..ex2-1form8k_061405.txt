and Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("CLASS B

EFFECTIVE TIME") into one share of a new class of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company ("COMMON STOCK") and (ii) each share of
Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("SERIES
A PREFERRED STOCK"), and Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Company ("SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK"), that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Recapitalization Merger Effective Time into that
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the exchange ratio specified
therefor in the Recapitalization and Merger Agreement.   (b) The respective
boards of directors of Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared
advisable, and the board of directors of Parent has approved, this Agreement
and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "MERGER") upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.   (c)
So long as this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with its
terms, the Recapitalization Merger shall not be consummated.   (d)
Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition to the
willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of

and (ii) take certain other actions in furtherance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "GUARANTEE").   (f) Certain capitalized
terms used in this Agreement have the meanings specified in Section 8.1.  
Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties to this
Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:   ARTICLE I

Corporation shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.   Section 1.2
CLOSING. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to
closing contained in Article VI, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING")
shall take place (a) at the offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and
Garrison LLP, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m.
on the third Business Day after the day on which the last of those conditions

Closing) is satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (b) at
such other place and time or on such other date as Parent and the Company
may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as
the "CLOSING DATE." Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time after the
date hereof all of the conditions contained in Article VI have been satisfied
or waived (other than those which by their terms are to be satisfied on the
Closing Date), but the approvals set forth in Section 1.2 of the Company
Disclosure Letter have not been obtained, Parent shall be entitled, by
delivery of written notice (the date of such notice, the "NOTICE DATE") to
the Company within three Business Days following receipt of a Satisfaction
Notice (as defined below) from the Company, to delay the Closing to the
earlier of (x) the fifth Business Day following the date on which all such
approvals shall have been obtained and (y) December 15, 2005; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that from and after the Notice Date, and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, (1) the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(c) of
this Agreement shall be deemed satisfied (and waived by Parent and Merger
Sub) for all purposes under this Agreement, (2) the condition set forth in
Section 6.2(d) shall be modified such that the officer\'s certificate
referred to therein shall no longer be required to provide any certification
as to the matters in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(c) and (3) neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall be entitled to assert that the condition set forth in
Section 6.2(b) was not satisfied with respect to periods on or prior to the
Notice Date. On any date upon which the conditions set forth in Sections
6.1 and 6.2(a), 6.2(b)    2   and 6.2(c) (with references in Sections
6.2(a), 6.2(b) and 6.2(c) to the "Closing Date" being deemed to be references
to such date) are satisfied (or waived by Parent), the Company shall deliver
written notice (a "Satisfaction Notice") to Parent certifying to the
satisfaction (or waiver) of such conditions as of such date.   Section 1.3
EFFECTIVE TIME. At the Closing, Parent and the Company shall cause a
certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") to be executed, signed,
acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective
when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such other subsequent date or time as
Parent and the Company may agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with the DGCL (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   Section 1.4 EFFECTS OF
THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the
DGCL.   Section 1.5 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. The certificate
of incorporation of the Company shall, at the Effective Time, be amended to

the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the
"SURVIVING CHARTER") until amended as provided in the Surviving Charter or by
applicable Laws.   Section 1.6 BYLAWS. The bylaws of the Company in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the
Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the "SURVIVING

Bylaws or by applicable Laws.   Section 1.7 DIRECTORS. The parties shall
take all requisite action so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly
elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws and the DGCL.  
Section 1.8 OFFICERS. The officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the officers of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws and
the DGCL.   Section 1.9 OTHER TRANSACTIONS. Parent shall have the option,
in its sole discretion and without requiring the further consent of the
Company or the board of directors or stockholders of the Company, upon

Parent confirming that all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and 6.2
have been satisfied or waived and that Parent and Merger Sub are prepared to
proceed immediately with the Closing (it being understood that in any event
the transactions described in clauses (a) and (b) will be deemed to have
occurred prior to the Closing), and (iii) such actions (or the inability
to complete such actions) shall not affect or modify in any respect the
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, including payment
of the Merger Consideration. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company in connection with any actions taken by the Company
in accordance with this Section 1.9. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint
and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Representatives for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered
or incurred by them in connection with such actions. Without limiting the
foregoing, none of the representations, warranties or covenants of the
Company shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any
of the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.9.   ARTICLE II

for those Excluded Shares.   (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY STOCK.   (1) Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to

aggregate number of issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock
and Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded

(4) All accrued and unpaid dividends on issued and outstanding shares of

Stock, Class B Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock (collectively, "COMPANY STOCK") that have been converted pursuant to

the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented those shares ("CERTIFICATES") shall cease to have any rights with
respect to those shares, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of their Certificates in accordance with Section
2.2.   Section 2.2 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) PAYING AGENT. Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust company,
satisfactory to the Company in its reasonable discretion, to act as the

agent agreement with the Paying Agent, the terms and conditions of which are
satisfactory to the Company in its reasonable discretion.   (b) PAYMENT
FUND. Promptly following the Effective Time, on the Closing Date, Parent
shall provide funds to the Paying Agent in amounts necessary for the payment

cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of  record of a Certificate (A)
a letter of transmittal in customary form,  specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title  to the Certificates shall pass, only

instructions for surrendering  Certificates.   (ii) SURRENDER OF
CERTIFICATES. Upon surrender of a  Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with a duly  executed letter of transmittal and any other
documents reasonably  required by the Paying Agent, the holder of that
Certificate shall be  entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration  payable in respect of that Certificate less any required
withholding of  Taxes. Any Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled
immediately.  No interest shall accrue or be paid on any amount payable
upon  surrender of Certificates.   (iii) UNREGISTERED TRANSFEREES. If any
Merger Consideration  is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the  surrendered Certificate is registered, then the Merger
Consideration  may be paid to such a transferee so long as (A) the
surrendered  Certificate is accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and  effect that transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment (1) 
pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (2) establishes to the  satisfaction of
Parent and the Paying Agent that any such Taxes have  already been paid or
are not applicable.   (iv) NO OTHER RIGHTS. Until surrendered in accordance
with  this Section 2.2(c), each Certificate shall be deemed, from and after 
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the  applicable
Merger Consideration. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the  surrender of
any Certificate shall be deemed to have been paid in full  satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to that Certificate and the  shares of Company Stock
formerly represented by it.   (d) NO FURTHER TRANSFERS. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall
be no further registration of transfers of the shares of Company Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (e) REQUIRED

entitled to deduct and withhold from any Merger Consideration payable under
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under (i) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "CODE"), (ii) any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (iii) any other applicable
Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld, those
amounts shall be treated as    6   having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made for all purposes under
this Agreement.   (f) NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates
for any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.   (g) INVESTMENT OF PAYMENT
FUND. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a
part of the Payment Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable
under Section 2.1(c) shall be paid promptly to Parent.   (h) TERMINATION OF
PAYMENT FUND. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Certificates one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered
by the Paying Agent to Parent upon demand. Thereafter, any holder of
Certificates who has not complied with this Article II shall look only to
Parent for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration.   (i) LOST,
STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate is lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by
such Person of a bond in the form and amount reasonably required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent on account of
the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall pay the applicable Merger Consideration to such Person in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.   Section 2.3 STOCK OPTIONS AND
RESTRICTED UNIT AWARDS. The Company shall take all requisite action so that,
as of the Effective Time, each restricted unit award and each option to
acquire shares of Class A Common Stock or Common Stock, as applicable (each,
a "COMPANY STOCK AWARD"), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder of that Company Stock Award, shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Stock Award
Consideration multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common
Stock or Common Stock, as applicable in respect of such restricted unit
awards and options, immediately prior to the Effective Time. "STOCK AWARD
CONSIDERATION" means (x) in the case of an option, the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of Common Stock or Class A Common
Stock, as applicable, over the per share exercise or purchase price of the
applicable Company stock option and (y) in the case of a restricted
unit award, Merger Consideration payable in respect of Common Stock or Class
A Common Stock, as applicable, as the same is required to be paid in respect
of the restricted unit award in accordance with the terms thereof. The
payment of the Stock Award Consideration to the holder of a Company Stock
Award shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required
under (i) the Code, (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or
(iii) any other applicable Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so
withheld, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of
that Company Stock Award for all purposes    7   under this Agreement.
All Company Stock Awards shall be cancelled and all Company Stock Award Plans
shall terminate at the Effective Time.   Section 2.4 DISSENTING SHARES.

consented to it in writing and (ii) has demanded the appraisal of such shares
in accordance with, and has complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL (collectively, the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.1(c). At the Effective Time, (x) all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled
and cease to exist and (y) the holder or holders of Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under Section 262
of the DGCL.   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a), if
any holder of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal
rights (through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then
that holder\'s shares (i) shall no longer be deemed to be Dissenting Shares
and (ii) shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing
such shares in accordance with Section 2.2.   (c) The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Stock, the withdrawals of such demands, and any other instrument
served on the Company under the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and
(ii) the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not offer
or agree to make or make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands without the
prior written consent of Parent.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND

Company from providing such information to Parent). The Company shall not,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or
modify any provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement
to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such
agreement.   (d) Subject to the Company\'s compliance with the provisions

the Company and its board of directors shall be permitted to:   (i) engage
in discussions with a Person who has made a  written Takeover Proposal not
solicited in violation of this Section 5.4  to clarify the terms of such
Takeover Proposal, or engage in discussions  or negotiations with a Person
who has made a written Takeover Proposal not  solicited in violation of this

Company determines in good faith (after  consultation with its advisors) that
such Takeover Proposal is reasonably  likely to result in a Superior
Proposal, (2) the board of directors of the  Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside  legal counsel) that such action is
necessary to comply with its fiduciary  obligations to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Laws and  (3) the Company has complied with

of  the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its 
advisors) that such Takeover Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a

Person to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the Company on terms 
and conditions substantially the same as those contained in the

comply with its fiduciary obligations to the  stockholders of the Company
under applicable Laws;   (iv) in response to the receipt of a Takeover
Proposal,  approve, endorse or recommend a written Takeover Proposal not
solicited in  violation of this Section 5.4 and, in connection therewith,
withdraw,  modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to  Parent, if the board of directors of the Company (A) has
determined in  good faith, after consultation with a nationally-recognized
and  independent financial advisor, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes
a  Superior Proposal and (B) has determined in good faith, after
consultation  with its outside legal counsel, that such actions are necessary
to comply  with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company
under  applicable Laws; or   (v) subject to the termination of this
Agreement in  compliance with Section 7.4(a), enter into an agreement
providing for the  implementation of a Superior Proposal.   (e)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors of the Company shall be
permitted to (i) disclose to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act and (ii) make such other public disclosure that it determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is required
under applicable Laws, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither the Company nor its
board of directors shall (x) recommend that the stockholders of the Company
tender their shares of Company Stock in connection with any tender or
exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover
Proposal) or (y) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation,
unless in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), the requirements of
Section 5.4(d) have been satisfied.   (f) The Company shall not take any
action to exempt any Person from the restrictions on "business combinations"
contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provisions) or otherwise
cause such restrictions not to apply unless such actions are taken
simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.4(a).   Section 5.5 NOTICES OF CERTAIN EVENTS.   (a) The Company
shall notify Parent promptly of (i) any communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this   
39   Agreement (and the response thereto from the Company, its Subsidiaries
or its Representatives), (ii) any communication from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and
the response thereto from the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Representatives), (iii) any material Legal Actions threatened or commenced
against or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
are related to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or (iv) any
event, change, occurrence, circumstance or development between the date of

cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) of this Agreement
not to be satisfied.   (b) Parent shall notify the Company promptly of (i)
any communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
(or other Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from Parent or its
Representatives), (ii) any communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the
response thereto from Parent or its Representatives) or (iii) any event,
change, occurrence, circumstance or development between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to
cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) of this Agreement
not to be satisfied.   (c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.5 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   Section 5.6 COMPANY PROXY
STATEMENT.   (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall prepare a draft of the Company Proxy
Statement. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such draft, and once such draft is in a form reasonably
acceptable to each of Parent and the Company, the Company shall file the
Company Proxy Statement with the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall
furnish all information concerning itself and its affiliates that is required
to be included in the Company Proxy Statement or that is customarily included
in proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type
contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) respond to any comments on the Company Proxy
Statement or requests for additional information from the SEC as soon as
practicable after receipt of any such comments or requests, (ii) have the
Company Proxy Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and (iii) cause
the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company
as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement. The Company
shall promptly (A) notify Parent upon the receipt of any such comments or
requests and (B) provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the
Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff,
on the other hand. If at any time prior to the    40   Company
Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any
of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement, so that the Company Proxy
Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated
above, prior to responding to any comments or requests of the SEC or the
filing or mailing of the Company Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto), the Company (x) shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of the Company Proxy
Statement and related correspondence and filings and (y) shall include
in such drafts, correspondence and filings all comments reasonably proposed
by Parent.   (c) The Company Proxy Statement shall recommend to
its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and include the Company
Board Recommendation unless the board of directors of the Company has
withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Board Recommendation in accordance
with Section 5.4(d).   Section 5.7 COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. The
Company shall call and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote and the requisite vote of the Company\'s
stockholders to adopt the Recapitalization and Merger Agreement and, so long
as this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Recapitalization Merger shall not be consummated. Unless this Agreement shall
have been terminated in accordance with Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4, the
Company shall hold the Company Stockholders Meeting regardless of whether the
Company has withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Board Recommendation.
Subject to Section 5.4(d), the Company shall (a) use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from its stockholders proxies in
favor of adoption of this Agreement and (b) take all other action necessary
or advisable to secure the Requisite Company Vote.   Section 5.8 EMPLOYEES;
BENEFIT PLANS.   (a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date
(the "CONTINUATION PERIOD"), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide Company Employees (other than those employees covered by a collective
bargaining agreement) who are employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as
of the Effective Time ("ACTIVE EMPLOYEES") with compensation and benefits
that are no less favorable in the aggregate, determined on an individual
basis, as those provided under the Company Benefit Plans in effect at the
Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing herein shall prevent the
amendment or termination of any specific plan, program or arrangement,
require that the Surviving Corporation provide or permit investment in the
securities of    41   Parent or the Surviving Corporation or interfere
with the Surviving Corporation\'s right or obligation to make such changes as
are necessary to comply with applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, nothing herein shall preclude the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any Active Employee for any
reason for which the Company could have terminated such person prior to the
Effective Time.   (b) Parent and its Affiliates shall honor all Company
Benefit Plans (including, without limitation, any severance, change of
control and similar plans and agreements) in accordance with their terms as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any amendment
or termination thereof that may be permitted by such Company Benefit Plans
and except as provided herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on and after
the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to permit those class B directors who are in the Company\'s
service as such on the date hereof, to direct, in accordance with Company
policy as in effect on the date hereof, the donation of complimentary hotel
room stays to tax-exempt organizations in the amount of no more than $350,000
in the aggregate. During the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide all
Active Employees who suffer a qualifying termination of employment with
severance benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided
to such Active Employees under the Company\'s severance policy as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (c) For all purposes under the
employee benefit plans of Parent and its affiliates providing benefits to any
Active Employees after the Effective Time (the "NEW PLANS"), each Active
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its affiliates before the Effective Time (including predecessor or
acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company and its
affiliates have given credit for prior service), to the same extent as such
Active Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar or comparable Company Benefit Plans (except to the
extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits). In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Active
Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan
replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan in which
such Active Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "OLD PLANS"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Active Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Active Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Active Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Employee\'s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Active Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New
Plan.    42    (d) Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that
all provisions contained herein with respect to employees are included for
the sole benefit of Parent and the Company and shall not create any right (i)
in any other Person, including any employees, former employees, any
participant in any Company Benefit Plans or any beneficiary thereof or (ii)
to continued employment with the Surviving Corporation.   Section 5.9
DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.   (a) Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of any present
or former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") as provided in the Company Organizational Documents or
in agreements between an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect on the date of this Agreement to
survive the Merger and to continue in full force and effect for a period of
not less than six years after the Effective Time.   (b) After the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify all Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Laws with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or
relating to their services as directors or officers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries occurring prior to the Effective Time. If any Indemnified Party
is or becomes involved in any Legal Action in connection with any matter
occurring prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, pay promptly after they
are incurred such Indemnified Party\'s reasonable legal fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such Legal Action, subject to Parent\'s
or the Surviving Corporation\'s, as applicable, receipt of an undertaking by
or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if required by the DGCL, to repay
such legal fees, costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined under
applicable Laws that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving
Company\'s written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified
Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any
single Legal Action except to the extent that two or more of such Indemnified
Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action.  
(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, (i)
maintain in effect for at least six years after the Effective Time, if
available, the current policies of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving
Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous) or (ii)
obtain as of the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six years from the Effective Time with at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous, in each case, with respect to claims arising out of or relating
to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time so long as Parent
and the Surviving Corporation are not required to pay an annual premium
in    43   excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company
for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (such 300% amount
being the "MAXIMUM PREMIUM"). The Company represents that such annual premium
amount is set forth in Section 5.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. If
the Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to obtain the insurance
described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to the
Maximum Premium, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.   (d) The covenants contained
in this Section 5.9 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs
and legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law,
contract or otherwise.   (e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors or assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.  
Section 5.10 BEST EFFORTS. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Laws, each of the
parties to this Agreement shall use its best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article VI are
satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable.   Section 5.11 CONSENTS; FILINGS; FURTHER
ACTION.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with applicable Laws, each of Parent and the
Company shall (i) use its best efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or
other authorizations, and make any filings and notifications required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
thereafter make any other submissions either required or deemed appropriate
by either Parent or the Company, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act, (B) the HSR Act and Foreign Competition Laws, (C) the DGCL, (D) the AMEX
rules and regulations and (E) any other applicable Laws. Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings and notifications, including by providing copies
of all relevant documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to
filing; and in furtherance thereof, as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, Parent and the Company agree to make an appropriate filing
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate   
44   Governmental Entity any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Neither Parent nor
the Company shall file any such document if the other party has reasonably
objected to the filing of such document. Neither Parent nor the Company shall
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting
period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Entity
without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly inform the other party upon receipt of any communication from the
Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental
Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If
Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Affiliates) receives a
request for additional information from any such Governmental Entity that is
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party
will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response to such request. Parent shall advise the
Company promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or
written) which Parent proposes to make or enter into with the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall use its best
efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition
or trade regulatory Laws.   (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party
consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions,
(ii) disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or (iii) required to prevent
a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to the Effective Time.
In the event that the Company shall fail to obtain any third party consent
described above, the Company shall use its best efforts, and shall take such
actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect
upon the Company and Parent and their respective businesses resulting, or
which could reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, from
the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from
any Person (other than a Governmental Entity) with respect to any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) without the prior written consent of
Parent which shall not be unreasonably withheld, none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval
or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
commitment or incur any Liability or other obligation due to such Person and
(ii) none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates shall be
required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or to
incur any Liability or other obligation. The Company shall comply with the
provisions of Section 5.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.   
45    Section 5.12 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements about this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the Company shall issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except to the extent required by applicable Laws or the AMEX
requirements, in which case that party shall use its reasonable commercial
efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or
making any such public statement.   Section 5.13 STOCK EXCHANGE DE-LISTING.
Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to cause
the Company Stock to be de-listed from the AMEX and de-registered under the
Exchange Act promptly following the Effective Time.   Section 5.14 FEES,
EXPENSES AND CONVEYANCE TAXES. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
expenses (including fees and expenses payable to Representatives and hedging
counterparties) incurred by any party to this Agreement or its Affiliates or
on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement ("EXPENSES") shall be paid by the party
incurring those Expenses, except (a) that Expenses incurred in connection
with the filing, printing and mailing of the Company Proxy Statement and the
filing fee under the HSR Act shall be shared equally by Parent and
the Company, (b) that all sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp,
registration, documentary, excise, real property transfer or gains, or
similar Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement shall be borne by Parent and (c) as otherwise provided in Section
7.6.   Section 5.15 TAKEOVER STATUTES. If any takeover statute is
or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and their respective boards of
directors shall (a) take all necessary action to ensure that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of such takeover statute.   Section
5.16 TAX MATTERS. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall:   (a) prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by them on or before the
Closing Date ("POST-SIGNING RETURNS") in a manner consistent with past
practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws;   (b) fully and
timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Post-Signing Returns
that are so filed;   (c) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in their
books and records and financial statements), for all Taxes payable by them
for which no Post-    46   Signing Return is due prior to the Effective
Time in a manner consistent with past practice; and   (d) terminate all Tax
sharing agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
such that there are no further Liabilities thereunder.   Section 5.17
RIGHTS PLAN. The Rights Plan shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the
Recapitalization Merger Effective Time, or, (ii) in the event the
Recapitalization Merger Effective Time does not occur prior to the
Effective Time, the Effective Time, without payment of any amounts to any
holders thereunder. Prior to the earlier of the Recapitalization Merger
Effective Time or the Effective Time, the Company shall not terminate, waive
any provision of, exempt any Person from or amend the terms of the Rights
Agreement (or redeem the Rights).   Section 5.18 FINANCING.   (a) Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect
thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii) to satisfy all
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in such definitive agreements
that are within its control. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in
the Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources on comparable or
more favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of
Parent) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any
party of the Commitment Letter or any termination of the Commitment Letter.
Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and
shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter
without first consulting with the Company or, if such amendment would or
would be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect or delay in
any material respect Parent\'s ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, without first obtaining the Company\'s prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) has
not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall continue to be obligated
to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this Agreement and to Parent\'s rights under Sections
7.2 and 7.3, regardless of whether Parent and Merger Sub have complied with
all of their other obligations under this Agreement (including their
obligations under this Section 5.18).   (b) The Company agrees to provide,
and shall cause the Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to
provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the   
47   ongoing operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries), including
(i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions,
(ii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, (iii) assisting Parent and its financing sources in the preparation
of (A) an offering document for any debt raised to complete the Merger and
(B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating
with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any debt
raised by Parent to complete the Merger, (v) forming new direct or indirect
Subsidiaries, and (vi) providing and executing documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent; provided that none of the Company or any Subsidiary
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent and Merger Sub
shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
the Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than historical information relating to the Company or the
Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set
forth in Section 6.2(b) of this Agreement, as it applies to the Company\'s
obligations under this Section 5.18(b), shall be deemed satisfied unless the
Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained primarily
as a result of the Company\'s willful and material breach of its obligations
under this Section 5.18(b).   (c) All non-public or otherwise confidential
information regarding the Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives
pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.   Section 5.19 RESIGNATIONS. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the
Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation
effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary designated by Parent to the Company in writing at least five
calendar days prior to the Closing.   Section 5.20 SUMMERFIELD. Promptly
upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall or shall cause Patriot
American Hospitality Partnership, L.P. ("PAHLP") to deliver an executed copy
of this Agreement to Sum Business Holdings, LLC ("LBREP") in accordance with
Section 9.8 of the Summerfield Venture Operating Agreement. In the event that
LBREP elects to invoke the Buy-Sell Procedures, Parent shall have the sole
and absolute right to cause PAHLP and the Company to take any and all actions
contemplated by the Buy-Sell Procedures (including, the funding of the
Deposit). In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly provide
Parent with any and all information with respect to the Summerfield Venture
that Parent may reasonably request in order for Parent to determine the Offer
Price (if PAHLP is required to provide) or to evaluate an Offer Price
submitted by LBREP. For purposes of this    48   Section 5.20,
"Summerfield Venture" means Summerfield Hotel Holding Company, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company and "Summerfield Venture
Operating Agreement" means that certain Amended and Restated Limited
Liability Company Agreement of Summerfield Hotel Holding Company, L.L.C.,
dated as of December 22, 2004. The capitalized terms "Buy-Sell Procedures",

only, references in  the definition of the term "Takeover Proposal" to the

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which corporations may be organized under the Delaware General Corporation
Law ("DGCL) or any successor statute.   FOURTH. The total number of shares
of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share.   FIFTH. The board of directors
of the Corporation, acting by majority vote, is expressly authorized to
adopt, alter, amend or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation.   SIXTH. The
Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by statute and all rights conferred upon stockholders
herein are granted subject to this reservation.   SEVENTH. No director of
the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director
or as such a member, except for liability (a) for any breach of the
director\'s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (b) for
acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the DGCL
or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper
personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended after the effective date of this
Certificate to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the
personal liability of directors or the person or persons exercising or
performing any of the powers or duties otherwise conferred or imposed upon
directors of the Corporation, then the liability of the director of the
Corporation or the person or persons exercising or performing any of the
powers or duties otherwise conferred or imposed upon directors of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by
the DGCL, as so amended. Any amendment or repeal of this Article VII by
either (i) the stockholders of the Corporation or (ii) an amendment to the
DGCL shall not adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time
of such amendment or repeal with respect to any acts or omissions occurring
before such amendment or repeal of a person serving as a director at the time
of such amendment or repeal.   EIGHTH. The Corporation shall indemnify its
directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law,
as now or hereafter in effect, and such right to indemnification shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the
Corporation and    shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors and personal and legal representatives; provided, however, that,
except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation
shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her
heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors.
The right to indemnification conferred by this Article VIII shall include the
right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending or
otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time
by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to
the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation
similar to those conferred in this Article VIII to directors and officers of
the Corporation. The rights to indemnification and to the advance of
expenses conferred in this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under this Certificate
of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Corporation, any statute, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Any amendment or
repeal of this Article VIII by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not
adversely affect any rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of
such amendment or repeal with respect to any acts or omissions occurring
prior to such amendment or repeal.      '
