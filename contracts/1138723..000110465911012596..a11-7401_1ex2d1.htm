this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company shall

become the debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving
Corporation.

(a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company shall
be amended and restated so that they read in their entirety as set forth in

provided by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the

 **ARTICLE II**

 

 **EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE**

 

 **CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) Subject to Sections 2.2(b) and 2.3(f), each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ " ) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall
thereupon be converted automatically into and become exchangeable for, and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive, (i) three dollars fifteen
cents ($3.15) in cash, without interest, and subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) 0.1648 shares
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") of
Parent (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and, subject to Section
2.2(b), shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f), in each case to be issued or paid in
accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.

 



 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or
owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be

 



      
 

 



 

canceled and shall cease to exist, and, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 



 

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(d) Each of (x) the Merger Consideration into which each share of Company
Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted automatically and for which
each such share shall become exchangeable, and which each such share shall
thereafter represent the right to receive, pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and (y)
the Company Stock Option Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split
(including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, split-up,
stock dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock or Parent Common Stock, exchange or readjustment of shares,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, merger or other similar
transaction, or other like change with respect to the Company Common Stock or
Parent Common Stock having a record date occurring on or after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the ratio of
the Cash Consideration (expressed in dollars) per share of Company Common
Stock to the Stock Consideration (expressed in number of shares of Parent
Common Stock) per share of Company Common Stock shall at all times following
any such equitable adjustment be the same as the ratio that the Cash
Consideration (expressed in dollars) per share of Company Common Stock bears
to the Stock Consideration (expressed in number of shares of Parent Common
Stock) per share of Company Common Stock, as set forth in Section 2.1(a);
_provided_ _further_ , that nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock,
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Other Company Stock Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option
(each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted under any employee or director stock option, stock purchase or
equity incentive or equity compensation plan, arrangement or agreement of the
Company other than the Company ESPP (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time,
into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Option_
"), on the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture
provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration
thereof provided for in the applicable Company Plan, related award document or
any other agreement) as were applicable under such Company Stock Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each such Parent Option shall be equal to (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the related Company Stock Option
immediately prior

 



      
 

 



 

to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Company Stock Option Exchange
Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Common
Stock, and such Parent Option shall have an exercise price per share (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock
Option divided by (B) the Company Stock Option Exchange Ratio; _provided_ ,
that in the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies as of the Effective Time (taking into account the effect of any
accelerated vesting thereof, if applicable) by reason of its qualification
under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; _provided_ _further_ , that in the
case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 409A of the Code applies as
of the Effective Time, the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise
of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code; and _provided_ _further_ , that to
the extent the option conversion method described herein would cause (x) the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock by Parent pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to the approval of
the holders of Parent Common Stock pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635 or (y)
the conversion of Company Stock Options under this Section into Parent Options
to acquire in excess of 2,500,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, then (1) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Parent Option shall be
proportionately reduced to the extent necessary to avoid the results described
in clauses (x) and (y) above and (2) the per share exercise price of each such
Parent Option shall be reduced to the extent necessary to preserve the
intrinsic value of the related Company Stock Option as determined immediately
prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Company
Stock Option Exchange Ratio_ " shall equal the sum of (x) (A) $3.15 divided by
(B) the volume weighted average of the daily closing prices per share of
Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending
on and including the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time, as
reported (by Bloomberg Financial Markets) in composite transactions for
NASDAQ, plus (y) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which each
share of Company Common Stock is entitled under Section 2.1(a) (as the same
may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.1(d)).

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, the Merger Consideration into which each share
of Company Restricted Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted automatically
and for which each such share shall become exchangeable, and which each such
share shall thereafter represent the right to receive, pursuant to Section
2.1(a), shall be paid without interest and shall be subject to the same terms
and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase
rights, but taking into account any acceleration thereof provided for in the
applicable Company Plan, related award document or any other agreement).
Therefore, the Cash Consideration payable pursuant to this Article II in
exchange for such Company Restricted Stock issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time (the " _Unvested Cash Consideration_ " and, together
with the Stock Consideration issuable pursuant to this Article II in exchange
for such Company Restricted Stock, the " _Unvested Merger Consideration_ ")
shall not automatically be payable at the Effective Time and shall instead
become payable upon the

 



      
 

 



 

date such Company Restricted Stock would have become vested under the vesting
schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
(subject to the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture
provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration
thereof provided for in the applicable Company Plan, related award document or
any other agreement). Parent shall make all such required payments to former
holders of Company Restricted Stock no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of
the calendar month immediately following the calendar month in which the
Unvested Cash Consideration shall become vested and payable in accordance with
this Section, and in its discretion may make such payments through a paying or
exchange agent authorized by Parent to administer such payments on Parents
behalf. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section shall be subject to any
required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest. All
outstanding rights to repurchase Company Restricted Stock that the Company may
hold or similar restrictions in the Companys favor in effect immediately
before the Effective Time (all such rights, the " _Repurchase Rights_ ") are
hereby assigned to Parent in the Merger, effective as of the Effective Time,
and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and subject
to the same conditions as were in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, except that Repurchase Rights may be exercised by Parent retaining the
remaining unpaid Unvested Merger Consideration into which such Company
Restricted Stock has been converted, and paying to the former holder thereof
the repurchase price in effect for each such share subject to that Repurchase
Right. No Unvested Merger Consideration, or the right thereto, may be pledged,
encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation
of law), by any Person, other than Parent, or be taken or reached by any legal
or equitable process in satisfaction of any Liability of such Person, before
the distribution to such Person of such Unvested Merger Consideration, in
accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company
Restricted Stock_ " means any Company Common Stock that is not vested under
the terms of any Company Stock Plan or any Contract with the Company
(including any restricted stock agreement, stock option agreement, stock
option exercise agreement or restricted stock purchase agreement) as of
immediately before the Effective Time. The exchange of shares of Company
Restricted Stock in partial consideration for the Unvested Cash Consideration,
and the vesting and payment of such Unvested Cash Consideration, are intended
to comply with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other IRS
guidance promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(c) _Certain Actions Relating to Company Stock Options and Company Restricted
Stock_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required
notices (which notices shall have been approved by Parent, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to each holder of
Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock setting forth each holders
rights pursuant to the applicable Company Stock Plan, stating that such
Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock shall be treated in the
manner set forth in this Section 2.2.

 



 

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all action
necessary for the adjustment of the Company Stock Options and Company
Restricted Stock under this Section 2.2. The Company shall ensure that
following the Effective Time, no current or former holder of a Company Stock
Option, any Company

 



      
 

 



 

Restricted Stock or a participant in any Company Stock Plan shall have any
right thereunder to acquire, or other rights in respect of, any capital stock
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or
any other equity interest therein (including any Company Stock Option, Company
Restricted Stock, "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights), other than
those rights specifically provided for in this Section 2.2.

 



 

(iii) Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will
be subject to Parent Options as a result of the actions contemplated by this
Section 2.2. As soon as practicable, but not later than five Business Days,
following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available, other
appropriate forms) with respect to offers and sales of the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such Parent Options and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent Options remain
outstanding and the offers and sales of Common Stock thereunder are required
to be registered. In connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Section 2.2, at the Effective Time, Parent may (if Parent determines that it
desires to do so) assume any or all of the Company Stock Plans, _provided_
that, if Parent elects to assume any Company Stock Plan, then, except as
expressly provided in Section 2.2(a) or Section 2.2(b) with respect to Parent
Options and shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange for Company
Restricted Stock, notwithstanding any provision of such Company Stock Plan,
Parent shall not be entitled to grant any stock awards, whether or not
permissible under applicable Law, using the share reserves of such Company
Stock Plan and, as of the Effective Time, all such then-ungranted shares that
were reserved for issuance under such Company Stock Plan shall thereafter be
deemed not to be reserved for issuance and no such shares shall be issued or
issuable under such Company Stock Plan. To the extent any Parent Options or
shares of Parent Common Stock are issued as provided for in Section 2.2(a) or
Section 2.2(b) and such issuance is under such Company Stock Plan, (A) stock
covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in
Section 2.2(a) and Section 2.2(b); (B) subject to the proviso in the
immediately preceding sentence, all references in such Company Stock Plan to a
number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer
instead to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying
the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the Company Stock
Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (C) the Parent Board or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of
such Company Stock Plan.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The current offerings in
progress as of the date hereof under the Companys 2007 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _Company ESPP_ "), shall continue, and the
shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued to participants thereunder on
the next currently scheduled purchase dates thereunder occurring after the
date hereof, subject to the terms and conditions of, the Company ESPP. In
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, any offering in progress as of
the Effective Time shall be shortened, and the "Exercise Date" (as defined in
the Company ESPP) shall be the Business Day immediately preceding the
Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

Each then outstanding option under the Company ESPP shall be exercised
automatically on such Exercise Date. Notwithstanding any restrictions on
transfer of stock in the Company ESPP, the treatment in the Merger of any
stock under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 2.1. The
Company shall terminate the Company ESPP as of or prior to the Effective Time.
The Company shall promptly after the date hereof amend the Company ESPP as
appropriate to avoid the commencement of any new offering of options
thereunder at or after the date hereof and prior to the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the Business
Day immediately following the Effective Time), Parent shall deposit (or cause
to be deposited, including amounts deposited by the Company as contemplated by
Section 5.13(a)) with a bank or trust company designated by Parent in writing
to the Company within 45 days after the date of this Agreement and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit
of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, (i) cash in an amount sufficient
to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1 and
(ii) book-entry shares representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1. In addition, Parent shall make available by
depositing with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time on or after
the Effective Time, any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.3(d) and any additional cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f). All certificates representing shares
of Parent Common Stock, dividends, distributions and cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, Parent
shall not be required to deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange
Agent, as part of the Exchange Fund or otherwise, any Merger Consideration, or
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d) or any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to
Section 2.3(f), that constitutes Unvested Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.2(b), and no such cash, dividends or distributions shall be payable
with respect to Company Restricted Stock (including by the Exchange Agent)
except in accordance with Section 2.2(b). The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than to fund payments of cash and shares of Parent
Common Stock due pursuant to Section 2.1, except as provided in this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates (" _Certificates_ ")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto, any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f), (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter
shall be in customary form and contain such other provisions as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for

 



      
 

 



 

use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f).
Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) a check or wire transfer (at the election of
Parent or the Exchange Agent) for the amount of Cash Consideration to which
such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.1, (B) that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held
by such holder under all Certificates so surrendered) to which such holder of
Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.1 (which shares of Parent Common Stock shall be in uncertificated
book-entry form), (C) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.3(d) and (D) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third Business Day following the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated shares
of Company Common Stock represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
(1) a wire transfer (if such holder has previously provided its wire transfer
information to the Exchange Agent in connection with the Merger) or check (if
such holder has not previously provided its wire transfer information to the
Exchange Agent in connection with the Merger) for the amount of Cash
Consideration to which such holder of Book-Entry Shares shall have become
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1, (2) that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder of Book-Entry Shares shall
have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1 (which shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be in book-entry form), (3) any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and (4) any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section
2.3(f), without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent, and such Book-Entry
Shares shall then be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Cash
Consideration, unpaid dividends and distributions or cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented
by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f).

 



 

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall

 



      
 

 



 

have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been
paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(d) (i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender
thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.3(f), in each
case until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with this Article II. Following the surrender of a Certificate in accordance
with this Article II, there shall be paid to the record holder thereof,
without interest, (A) promptly after such surrender, the amount of any
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(f) and (B) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, holders of
Book-Entry Shares who are entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
under this Article II shall be paid (A) at the time of payment of such Parent
Common Stock by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.3(b), the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(f) and (B) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the time of such
payment by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.3(b) and a payment date
subsequent to the time of such payment by the Exchange Agent under Section
2.3(b) payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(e) The Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f) issued and paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no
dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock shall
be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company
who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise
be entitled to receive (taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
held at the Effective Time by such holder and rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) pursuant to Section 2.1 by (ii) the
volume weighted average closing price of one share of Parent Common Stock on
The NASDAQ Global Select Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") for the ten trading days ending
on the last trading day immediately prior to the date on which the Effective
Time shall occur, as such price is reported (by Bloomberg Financial Markets or
such other source as the parties shall agree in writing) in composite
transactions for NASDAQ.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for
payment of the Merger Consideration, any unpaid dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f).

 



 

(h) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration,
dividends or other distributions with respect thereto or cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 



 

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of
such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of,
or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by,
the U.S. government. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand.

 



 

(j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f).

 



 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock (including
Company Restricted Stock) , Company Stock Options or otherwise pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold such Taxes first from the Cash Consideration payable
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and then from the Stock Consideration.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (which shall be arranged in
numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered
Sections in this Agreement and which disclosure in any such section shall be
deemed to qualify and apply to other Sections in this Agreement to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other Sections) (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) (it being understood and agreed that "good standing"
for purposes of the WBCL means that the Company has filed its most recent
annual report and has not filed articles of dissolution) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as now being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to
do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except in the case of clause (iii),
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company
Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event, change, circumstance or effect
that (A) is materially adverse to the business, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (B) materially impairs the ability of the Company to
consummate, or prevents or

 



      
 

 



 

materially delays, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clause (A) of
this definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" only, Company Material
Adverse Effect shall not include any event, change, circumstance or effect (1)
generally affecting the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate, or the economy or the financial or securities markets in the United
States, including effects on such industry, economy or markets resulting from
any regulatory and political conditions or developments in general, including
any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or declared or undeclared acts of
war or terrorism and including changes in interest rates; (2) reflecting or
resulting from changes in Law or GAAP or accounting standards; (3)
demonstrably resulting from the announcement or pendency of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (4) any change, in and of itself, in the
market price or trading volume of Company Common Stock; (5) changes in any
analyst recommendations, any financial strength rating or any other similar
recommendations or ratings as to the Company or its Subsidiaries (including,
in and of itself, any failure to meet analyst projections); (6) the loss by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its customers, suppliers or
employees as a result of the announcement of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (7) the failure, in and of itself, of the Company to meet any
expected or projected financial or operating performance target, whether
internal or published, for any period ending on or after the date of this
Agreement as well as any change, in and of itself, by the Company in backlog
or any other expected or projected financial or operating performance target
as compared with any target prior to the date of this Agreement; (8) any suit,
action or other legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement
or (9) any actions taken that are specifically required in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or taken at the written request of Parent or with the
prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ , that, with respect to clause
(1), the impact of such event, change, circumstance or effect is not
disproportionately adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, relative to other participants in the industry in which the Company
operates; and _provided_ , _further_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that with
respect to clauses (4), (5) and (7), the facts and circumstances giving rise
to or contributing to such failure or change may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
Companys amended and restated articles of incorporation (the " _Company
Charter_ ") and amended and restated bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), in
each case as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered
is in full force and effect. The Company is not in violation of any provision
of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, in each case as amended to the date
of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
articles of incorporation and by-laws (or comparable organizational documents)
of each of the Companys Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of
this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and effect. No
Subsidiary of the Company is in violation of its articles of incorporation or
by-laws (or comparable organizational documents), in each case as amended to
the date of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.2 _Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of two hundred
million (200,000,000) shares of Company Common Stock and ten million
(10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "
_Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of the close of business on February 28,
2011, (i) 56,118,357 shares of Company Common Stock (excluding treasury
shares) were issued and outstanding (of which 2,972,648 shares were shares of
Company Restricted Stock), (ii) 134,125 shares of Company Common Stock were
held by the Company in its treasury, (iii) no shares of Company Preferred
Stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of Company Preferred Stock
were held by the Company in its treasury, (iv) 7,335,822 shares of Company
Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to Company Stock Plans (of
which 4,208,037 shares were subject to outstanding Company Stock Options) and
(v) 254,475 shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company ESPP.
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all
shares reserved for issuance as noted in clause (iv) or (v) above will be,
when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable (subject to the personal liability which
may be imposed on shareholders by former Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL,
as judicially interpreted, for debts incurred prior to June 14, 2006 owing to
employees for services performed, but not exceeding six months service in any
one case) and not subject to any preemptive rights. No shares of capital stock
of the Company are owned by any Subsidiary of the Company. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable or exercisable for, securities having the right to vote) with the
shareholders of the Company on any matter. Except as set forth above in this
Section 3.2(a) and except for changes since February 28, 2011 resulting from
the exercise or forfeiture of Company Stock Options or the forfeiture of
Company Restricted Stock awards, in each case, as described in Section 3.2(b),
there are no outstanding (A) shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or equity interests of the Company, (B) securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
shares of capital stock of the Company or other voting securities or equity
interests of the Company, (C) stock appreciation rights, "phantom" stock
rights, performance units, interests in or rights to the ownership or earnings
of the Company or other equity equivalent or equity-based award or right, (D)
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments, Contracts or other
rights to acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or obligations
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any shares of capital
stock of the Company, voting securities, equity interests or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or other
voting securities or equity interests of the Company or rights or interests
described in clause (C) or (E) obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or
to issue, grant, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, granted, delivered or
sold, any such securities. Except for the Support Agreement, there are no
shareholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or on file with the
Company with respect to the holding, voting, registration, redemption,
repurchase or disposition of, or that restricts the transfer of, any capital
stock or other equity interest of the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all holders, as of February 28, 2011, of outstanding Company
Restricted Stock, Company Stock Options or other rights to purchase or receive
shares of Company Common Stock or similar rights granted under the Company
Stock Plans or otherwise (collectively, " _Company Stock Awards_ "),
indicating as applicable, with respect to each Company Stock Award then
outstanding, the type of award granted, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Award, the name of the plan under which
such Company Stock Award was granted, the date of grant, exercise or purchase
price, vesting schedule, payment schedule (if different from the vesting
schedule) and expiration thereof, and whether (and to what extent) the vesting
of such Company Stock Award will be accelerated or otherwise adjusted in any
way or any other terms will be triggered or otherwise adjusted in any way
(except as expressly required or expressly permitted by this Agreement) by the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the
termination of employment or engagement or change in position of any holder
thereof following or in connection with the Merger. Each Company Stock Option
intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the
Code so qualifies and the exercise price of each other Company Stock Option is
no less than the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock as
determined on the date of grant of such Company Stock Option. No Company Stock
Option or Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding has been granted other
than pursuant to the Company Stock Plans. The Company has made available to
Parent true and complete copies of all Company Stock Plans and the forms of
all stock option agreements evidencing outstanding Company Stock Options.

 



 

(c) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other voting securities
or equity interests of each Subsidiary of the Company have been duly
authorized and validly issued, are fully paid, nonassessable and not subject
to any preemptive rights. All of the shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or equity interests of each such Subsidiary are owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens,
charges, options, rights of first refusal, encumbrances and security interests
of any kind or nature whatsoever (including any limitation on voting, sale,
transfer or other disposition or exercise of any other attribute of ownership)
(collectively, " _Liens_ "), other than Permitted Liens and transfer and other
restrictions under applicable federal and state securities Laws. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds, debentures,
notes or other obligations having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable or exercisable for, securities having the right to vote) with the
shareholders of any such Subsidiary on any matter. There are no outstanding
(A) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or equity interests of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, (B) stock
appreciation rights, "phantom" stock rights, performance units, interests in
or rights to the ownership or earnings of any of the Companys Subsidiaries or
other such equity equivalent or equity-based award or right, (C)
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments, Contracts or other
rights to acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or obligations
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any shares of capital
stock of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, voting securities, equity
interests or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or rights or interests described in clause (B) or (D)
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

acquire any such securities or to issue, grant, deliver or sell, or cause to
be issued, granted, delivered or sold, any such securities. There are no
shareholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or on file with any of
the Companys Subsidiaries with respect to the holding, voting, registration,
redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that restricts the transfer of,
any capital stock or other equity interest of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries

 



 

Section 3.3 _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company, including
its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, and a true and complete list
of each other corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other
entity that is not a Subsidiary but in which the Company, directly or
indirectly, owns an equity interest (each, a " _Company Minority Interest
Business_ "). All of the shares of capital stock or other equity or voting
interests of each such Company Minority Interest Business that are owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof are owned free
and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens and transfer and other
restrictions under applicable federal and state securities Laws. Except for
the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, its Subsidiaries
and its interests in the Company Minority Interest Businesses, the Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any equity, membership interest,
partnership interest, joint venture interest, or other equity or voting
interest in, or any interest convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for
any of the foregoing, nor is it under any current or prospective obligation to
form or participate in, provide funds to, make any loan, capital contribution,
guarantee, credit enhancement or other investment in, or assume any liability
or obligation of, any Person.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Authority_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of
the Merger, to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the holders of
at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by holders of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Shareholder
Approval_ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent
and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and subject to general principles
of equity).

 



 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held on or prior to the
date of this Agreement at which all directors of the Company were present,
duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) determining that it is in the
best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and declaring it advisable
for the Company, to enter into this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) approving the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and (iii) subject to Section 5.2, resolving and agreeing
to submit this agreement to the shareholders of the Company and to recommend
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby by the shareholders of the Company, which resolutions have not been
subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way, except as may be
permitted by Section 5.2.

 



 

(c) The Company Shareholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of the Companys capital stock or other securities required in
connection with the consummation of the Merger. No vote of the holders of any
class or series of the Companys capital stock or other securities is required
in connection with the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated by the Company other than the Merger.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties set forth in this
Section 3.4 is based on the accuracy of Parents representations and
warranties in Section 4.19, the Companys representations and warranties in
this Section 3.4 shall be limited to the extent affected by any inaccuracy in
Section 4.19.

 



 

Section 3.5 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 



 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancelation,
modification or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a material
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the
properties, assets or rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under,
or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitlements under, or require any consent, waiver or approval of any Person
pursuant to, any provision of (i) (A) the Company Charter or Company Bylaws,
or (B) the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational
documents) of any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) any Company Material
Contract or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters
referred to in Section 3.5(b), any federal, state, local or foreign law
(including common law), statute, ordinance, rule, code, regulation, order,
judgment, injunction or decree issued or promulgated by a Governmental Entity
(" _Law_ ") or any rule or regulation of NASDAQ applicable to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets are bound, except, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), as individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration, filing with or notice to, any federal, state, local or foreign
government or subdivision thereof or any other governmental, administrative,
judicial, arbitral, legislative, executive, regulatory or self-regulatory
authority, instrumentality, agency, commission or

 



      
 

 



 

body (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is required by or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except
for (i) the filing of the pre-merger notification report under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), and
any filings required under other applicable foreign or supranational antitrust
and competition Laws, (ii) such filings and reports as may be required
pursuant to the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

securities, takeover and "blue sky" laws, (iii) the filing of the Articles of
Merger with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions as required by
the WBCL, (iv) any filings and approvals required under the rules and
regulations of NASDAQ and (v) such other consents, approvals, orders,

and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

Section 3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC since
May 8, 2007 under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (all such documents,
together with all exhibits and schedules thereto and all information
incorporated therein by reference, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). Since
January 1, 2010, all Company SEC Documents have been timely filed. As of their
respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), the Company SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, including, in each case,
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including the related notes
thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Documents
(i) have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto)and (ii)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company, its Subsidiaries and Compact Particle Acceleration Corporation ("
_CPAC_ " and, together with the Companys Subsidiaries, the " _Consolidated
Subsidiaries_ ") as of the respective dates thereof and their respective
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the respective periods
then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and
recurring year-end audit adjustments that were not, or are not expected to be,
material in amount and to any other adjustments described therein, including
the notes thereto). Since December 31, 2010, the Company has not made any
change in the accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of
its financial statements, except as required by GAAP,

 



      
 

 



 

SEC rule or policy or applicable Law or as described in the notes to such
financial statements. The Companys backlog as of December 31, 2010, as
presented in the Companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2010, has been prepared in good faith in accordance with the
criteria disclosed in such Form 10-K. To the knowledge of the Company,
financial statements required by Governmental Entities for Subsidiaries of the
Company organized in a jurisdiction other than a state of the United States
have been prepared in accordance with applicable foreign Law in all material
respects and filed, to the extent required, in a timely manner with such
Governmental Entities.

 



 

(c) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information relating to the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries required
to be disclosed in the Companys periodic and current reports under the
Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
period specified in SEC rules and forms, and accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, by others within
those entities to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures as
required under the Exchange Act. All certifications of the principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer, or persons performing similar
functions, of the Company that are required to be filed with or furnished to
the SEC or included in or as an exhibit to an SEC Document have been so filed,
furnished or included, as the case may be, and all such certifications are
complete and accurate and comply as to form in all respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of the
Companys financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(e) (i) Since January 1, 2009, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee,

other written communication alleging or relating to a possible material
violation of any Law applicable to their businesses, operations, properties or
assets. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, authorizations, operating certificates, franchises,
orders, clearances and approvals of all Governmental Entities (collectively, "
_Permits_ ") necessary for them to own, lease or operate their properties and
assets and to carry on their businesses and operations as now conducted,
except for any failure to hold such Permits that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be

 



      
 

 



 

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and there has occurred no
violation of, default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under
or event giving to others any right of revocation, non-renewal, adverse
modification or cancelation of, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both, any such Permit, nor would any such revocation, non-renewal, adverse
modification or cancelation result from the consummation of the transactions

Effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.11(a), no
representation or warranty is made in this Section 3.11(a) in respect of the

and Section 3.24.

 



 

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any consent
decree from any Governmental Entity. Neither the Company nor any of its

and Drug Administration (the " _FDA_ ") or equivalent action from any
comparable non-U.S. Governmental Entity since May 8, 2007. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any communication from any regulatory
agency or been notified since May 8, 2007 that any product approval is
withdrawn or modified or that such an action is under consideration. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in
compliance, in all material respects, with all current applicable statutes,
rules, regulations, guidelines, policies or orders administered or issued by
the FDA, including the Public Health Service Act (" _FDA Laws_ ") or
comparable foreign Governmental Entity (" _Foreign Device Laws_ ") including
FDAs Quality System Regulation, 21 C.F.R. Part 820 and requirements for
Investigational Device Exemptions, 21 C.F.R. Part 812. To the knowledge of the
Company, there are no facts that would be reasonably likely to result in any
Form FDA-483 other than those issues that have been entered into the Companys
corrective and preventive action (CAPA) system, as established within the
Companys quality system. Since May 8, 2007, there have been no recalls,
detentions, withdrawals, seizures, or termination or suspension of
manufacturing requested or threatened relating to the Companys or its

accordance with 21 U.S.C. § 360(e) and 21 C.F.R. Part 814 (" _PMAs_ ") for the
Companys and its Subsidiaries products are exclusively owned by the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries, and there is no reason to believe that the FDA is
considering limiting, suspending, or rescinding any such 510(k)s or PMAs or
changing the marketing classification or labeling of any such products. To the
knowledge of the Company, there is no false information or significant
omission in any product application or product-related submission to the FDA
or comparable foreign Governmental Entity. The Company and its Subsidiaries

material additional conditions on the distribution or sale of products in a

contractor, or agent for the Company or its Subsidiaries is in compliance with
all Permits and regulatory approvals from the FDA or comparable Governmental
Entity insofar as they pertain to the manufacture of product components or
products for the Company or its Subsidiaries.

nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or claim asserting
or suggesting that any such infringement, misappropriation, or dilution is or

Adverse Effect. To the Companys knowledge, no third party is

agreement under which Intellectual Property is licensed to or by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and that is material to any of the businesses of

and obligations of the parties thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has transferred ownership of, or granted any exclusive license
with respect to, any Intellectual Property that is or was material to the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. At the Effective Time,

Subsidiaries held immediately prior to the Effective Time, and all of such
rights shall be exercisable by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time to the same extent as by the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.

business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except in the case of clause (iii),
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent
Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event, change, circumstance or effect
that (A) is materially adverse to the business, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (B) materially impairs the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate, or prevents or materially delays, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the case of clause (A) of this definition of "Parent Material Adverse Effect"
only, Parent Material Adverse Effect shall not include any event,

 



      
 

 



 

change, circumstance or effect (1) generally affecting the industry in which
Parent and its Subsidiaries operate, or the economy or the financial or
securities markets in the United States, including effects on such industry,
economy or markets resulting from any regulatory and political conditions or
developments in general, including any outbreak or escalation of hostilities
or declared or undeclared acts of war or terrorism and including changes in
interest rates; (2) reflecting or resulting from changes in Law or GAAP or
accounting standards; (3) demonstrably resulting from the announcement or
pendency of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (4) any change,
in and of itself, in the market price or trading volume of Parent Common
Stock; (5) changes in any analyst recommendations, any financial strength
rating or any other similar recommendations or ratings as to Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including, in and of itself, any failure to meet analyst
projections); (6) the loss by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any of its
customers, suppliers or employees as a result of the announcement of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (7) the failure, in and of
itself, of Parent to meet any expected or projected financial or operating
performance target, whether internal or published, for any period ending on or
after the date of this Agreement as well as any change, in and of itself, by
Parent in backlog or any other expected or projected financial or operating
performance target as compared with any target prior to the date of this
Agreement; (8) any suit, action or other legal proceeding arising out of or
related to this Agreement or (9) any actions taken that are specifically
required in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or taken at the
written request of the Company or with the prior written consent of the
Company; _provided_ , that, with respect to clause (1), the impact of such
event, change, circumstance or effect is not disproportionately adverse to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other participants
in the industry in which Parent operates; and _provided_ , _further_ , for the
avoidance of doubt, that with respect to clauses (4), (5) and (7), the facts
and circumstances giving rise to or contributing to such failure or change may
be taken into account in determining whether there has been a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, either Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent owns, is licensed or otherwise possesses legally
enforceable rights to use, all Intellectual Property used in their respective
businesses as currently conducted. Except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, (i) as of the date hereof, there are no pending or, to the knowledge
of Parent, threatened claims by any Person alleging that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries infringes the Intellectual Property of such Person and (ii) to
the knowledge of Parent, the conduct of the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries does not infringe any Intellectual Property of any Person. To
Parents knowledge, no third party is misappropriating, infringing or diluting
in any material respect any Intellectual Property owned by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries that is material to any of the businesses of the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries. Except as would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, Parent and its Subsidiaries use the Intellectual Property of third
parties in accordance with the terms of Intellectual Property license
agreements between such third parties and Parent or its Subsidiaries. Neither
the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of any agreement affecting

(c) Parent takes commercially reasonable steps to protect and preserve its
rights in any material Intellectual Property of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including executing proprietary information, confidentiality and assignment
agreements with current and former executive officers, employees, consultants
and contractors who have participated in the development of Parents or its
Subsidiaries products, including software, and Intellectual

 



      
 

 



 

Property of Parent and its Subsidiaries). No prior or current employee,
officer, consultant or contractor of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
asserted or, to the knowledge of Parent, has any ownership interest in any
Intellectual Property used by Parent or its Subsidiaries in the operation of
their respective businesses.

 



 

(d) To the knowledge of Parent, except as, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has licensed any of the

in all material respects. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has timely paid
or caused to be timely paid all material Taxes that have become due and
payable by it (whether or not shown on any Tax Return). The most recent
financial statements contained in the Parent SEC Documents reflect an adequate
reserve (in addition to any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and tax income) for all material Taxes payable
by Parent and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof
through the date of such financial statements. Parent and its Subsidiaries
have no present or contingent liability for any material Taxes, other than
Taxes incurred in the ordinary course of business and reflected as liabilities

proceedings with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in progress, nor has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries received
written notice from any Governmental Entity that it intends to commence such
an audit, investigation or proceeding. Parent has no knowledge that any audit,
investigation, or proceeding is being contemplated by any Governmental
Authority. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice from a Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction in which Parent or any
Subsidiary has not filed a Tax Return for any period that Parent or such
Subsidiary is required to file a material Tax Return in such jurisdiction.

Subsidiaries shall include references to any Person which merged with and into
or liquidated into Parent or such Subsidiary, as applicable.

such actions (each such action set forth in this Section 5.2(d)(i) being
referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or

 



 

(ii) (A) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,

agreement or other Contract (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ")

lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or (B) resolve, agree or propose to take any
such actions.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing Sections 5.2(d)(i) and (d)(ii), at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may,
solely in response to a Superior Proposal received after the date hereof that
did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2, if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to do so is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, taking into
account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by
Parent pursuant to this Section 5.2(e), (x) make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii) (including payment of the Termination Fee) and concurrently
enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement in response to a
Superior Proposal as referred to above unless (1) the Company promptly
notifies Parent in writing at least four Business Days before taking that
action of its intention to do so, and specifying the reasons therefor,
including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of any Person making,
such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishing a copy of the
relevant Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant transaction
documents (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
written notice by the Company and a new four Business Day period) and (2)
prior to the expiration of such four Business Day period, Parent does not make
a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisor) to be at least as favorable as the Superior
Proposal after giving effect to,

 



      
 

 



 

among other things, the payment of the Termination Fee set forth in Section
7.3, such that the Company Board determines such action is no longer required
by its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable
Law. During the four Business Day period prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement as referred to above, the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent.

 



 

(f) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections
5.2(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), the Company promptly, and in any event within
one Business Day of receipt (unless such receipt is by any director or
executive officer of the Company or a director an executive officer has
knowledge of such receipt by the Company, in which case such one Business Day
period shall instead be deemed to be a 24 hour period from the time of such
receipt by, or the time such knowledge was first gained by, such director or
executive officer), shall advise Parent in writing in the event the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition
Proposal or indication by any Person that it is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information, discussion or
negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates an
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry, proposal or offer that is

proposal or offer and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer, and shall furnish Parent with a
copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or, where such Acquisition Proposal is not
in writing, with a description of the material terms and conditions thereof).
The Company shall keep Parent informed (orally and in writing) in all material
respects on a timely basis of the status and details (including, within one
Business Day after the occurrence (or, if a director or an executive officer
of the Company was involved in or had knowledge of such occurrence, then
within 24 hours of the time of such director or executive officers first
involvement therein or at which such director or executive officer first
gained such knowledge) of any amendment, modification, development, discussion
or negotiation by the Company) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request,
inquiry, proposal or offer, including furnishing copies of any written
inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of
any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting any of the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within one Business
Day or, in the case of any such determination or engagement by any director or
executive officer or of which a director or an executive officer has
knowledge, then within 24 hours of the time of such determination or
engagement or at which such director or executive officer first gained such
knowledge) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin
providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning
an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 5.2(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) and
shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in such
discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.

Agreement that would restrict the Companys ability to comply with any of the
terms of this Section 5.2, and represents that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on
"business combinations" contained in Section 180.1141 of the WBCL (or any
similar provision of any other Takeover Law) or otherwise cause such
restrictions not to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case,
unless such actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii).

 



 

(i) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, that in no event shall this Section 5.2(i) affect the obligations of
the Company specified in Sections 5.2(d) and (f); and provided further, that
any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
(including for purposes of Section 7.1(c)(ii)) unless the Company Board
expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its shareholders in favor of the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby at least two Business Days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting.

 



 

(j) For purposes of this Agreement:

transaction, (B) of 15% or more of any class of capital stock, other equity
security or voting power of the Company or any resulting parent company of the

if financing is required, such financing is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Company Board, (A) is more favorable to the
shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the

terms and conditions proposed by Parent in response to such proposal pursuant

Section 5.3 _Preparation of Form S-4 and Proxy Statement; Company
Shareholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, (i) the
Company shall prepare (with Parents reasonable cooperation) and file with the
SEC a proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, and
including the letter to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, notices of
meetings of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, proxy statement and
form of proxy and any other soliciting material to be distributed to holders
of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger, and any
schedules required to be filed therewith, collectively, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") to be sent to the shareholders of the Company relating to the
special meeting or annual meeting of the Companys shareholders (the "
_Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") to be held to consider the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and (ii) Parent shall prepare (with the Companys
reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-4 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Form S-4_"), in
which the Proxy Statement will be included, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective
as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying
to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or
filing a general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance
of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the Company shall furnish
all information concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock
as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the Companys shareholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or
the Company, as applicable, without providing the other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and without the others prior
approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Parent or the Company, as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it
receives oral or written notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective or any amendment or supplement thereto has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of
the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto
or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide
the other with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state
securities commission and a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
responses thereto. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the

 



      
 

 



 

Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall promptly be filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required under applicable Law, disseminated to
shareholders of the Company; _provided_ that the delivery of such notice and
the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act, the Company shall establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting solely for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval. Except in the case
of an Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted by Section 5.2(e),
the Company, through the Company Board, shall (i) recommend to its
shareholders that they approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement
and (iii) at the request of Parent, publicly reaffirm such recommendation
within 10 Business Days after the date any Acquisition Proposal or any
material modification thereto is first commenced, published or sent or given
to the Companys shareholders (which reaffirmation must also include, with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, an unconditional rejection of such
Acquisition Proposal, it being understood that taking no position with respect
to the acceptance of such Acquisition Proposal or modification thereto shall
constitute a failure to reject such Acquisition Proposal).

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable access

obtaining any consent without the prior written consent of Parent. Each of

 



      
 

 



 

the parties hereto shall furnish to each other party such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law relating
to the exchange of information, counsel for Parent and the Company shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall

existing policies as of the date hereof or (ii) request that the Company
obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance
programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); and _provided_ _further_

following the request, such report shall be a reasonably detailed projection
of such cash and cash equivalents, based on the Companys reasonable and good
faith expectations as to future sources of cash and cash equivalents and needs

eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accrual (other than under a
defined benefit pension plan)) under each employee benefit plan, policy,
program, arrangement or agreement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or such

Affiliate makes such plan, policy, program, arrangement or agreement available
to such Continuing Employee, and except as would result in any duplication of
benefits for the same period of service.

Time, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Affiliates of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the
extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such
employees under the welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying
any analogous deductible or out of pocket requirements to the extent

employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in any respect, including in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries or any other Affiliates of Parent, and no provision of this
Section 5.14 shall create such rights in any such persons in respect of any
benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company Plan
or any employee program or any plan or arrangement of Parent or any of its
Affiliates. No provision of this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on
the rights to amend, modify or terminate after the Effective Time any such
plans or arrangements of Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries or any other
Affiliates of Parent in accordance with the terms of such plans or
arrangements.

each reference to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be
deemed to be a reference to "50%");

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii); or

with or related to the authorization, preparation, investigation, negotiation,

hereby (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), up to a maximum amount of $1,500,000;
_provided_ , that the payment by the Company of the Parent Expenses pursuant

obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(i) except to
the extent indicated in Section 7.3(b) and (ii) shall not relieve the Company
from any liability or damage resulting from any fraud or willful or

within two Business Days thereof), in the case of termination by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) or (iii) simultaneously with, and as a
condition to the effectiveness of, termination, in the case of a termination

delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party. No failure or
delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
