AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of September 16, 2004 by and among Laureate Education, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Acquiror"), Laureate Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (the "Merger Subsidiary") and Walden e-Learning, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").   

RECITALS    

 The Acquiror, the Merger Subsidiary and the Company believe it is in the best interests of their respective companies and the stockholders of their respective companies that the Company and the Merger Subsidiary combine into a single company through the statutory merger of the Company with and into the Merger Subsidiary (the "Merger"), with the Merger Subsidiary surviving the Merger.   

 Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), other than those held by the Acquiror, shall be converted into (i) shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Acquiror (the "Acquiror Stock") and (ii) Notes (as defined in Section 1.6(b) below) to be issued by the Acquiror representing in the aggregate, $19 million.   

 For United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of section 368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.   

 The Acquiror, the Merger Subsidiary and the Company desire to make certain representations and warranties and other agreements in connection with the Merger.   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined below) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "Certificate of Merger") and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), the Company shall be merged with and into the Merger Subsidiary, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and the Merger Subsidiary shall continue as the surviving corporation. The Merger Subsidiary as the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."    ##### 

  

  

 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Piper Rudnick LLP, 6225 Smith Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21209-3600, at 10:00 a.m. local time on the date hereof or as soon thereafter as practicable (said time and date of closing being herein called the "Closing Date"). On the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the time and date of such filing being the "Effective Time" and the "Effective Date," respectively).   

 1.3  _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and the Merger Subsidiary shall vest in the Merger Subsidiary as the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and the Merger Subsidiary shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Merger Subsidiary as the Surviving Corporation.

In connection with the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall change its name to "Walden e-Learning, Inc."   

 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, the directors of the Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office until such time as such directors resign, are removed or their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The officers of the Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office until such time as such officers resign, are removed or their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.   

 1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the Acquiror or the Merger Subsidiary:   

 (a) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock Owned by Acquiror_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by the Acquiror issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Cancelled Shares") shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no Acquiror Stock, Notes or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.   

 (b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares) shall be converted into and become the right to receive (i) 0.2551021 shares of Acquiror Stock and (ii) a note issued by the Acquiror in the amount set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto representing a _pro rata_  portion of $19 million, based on the number of shares of Company    ##### 

  

  

Common Stock owned by such stockholder of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the form of such Note to be as set forth in _Exhibit
C_ hereto (each, a "Note") ((i) and (ii) collectively being, the
"Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, upon surrender of such certificate(s) in accordance
with _Section 1.7_ of this Agreement.   

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Subsidiary Shares_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Converted Shares"), shall be converted into and shall become one duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate representing any Converted Shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   

 (d) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Acquiror Stock will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Acquiror Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Acquiror Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from the Acquiror an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction multiplied by (ii) the closing price per share of the Acquiror Stock as reported by the Nasdaq Stock Market on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date.   

 1.7 _Surrender and Exchange of Certificates_.   

 (a) _Availability of Consideration_. At the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall make available and pay in accordance with the terms hereof: (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares.   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. Each of the stockholders of the Company other than the Acquiror (collectively, the "Stockholders") has delivered to the Acquiror on the Closing Date the original certificates or appropriate affidavits of loss therefor (the "Certificates") representing all of his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock, and the Acquiror has (i) instructed (and shall not revoke such instruction to) its transfer agent to deliver promptly on the Closing Date to the holder of such Certificate, in exchange therefor, a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Acquiror Stock into which such Company Common Stock is converted, (ii) delivered to the holder of such Certificate, in exchange therefor, cash in immediately available funds to an account designated by such stockholder in lieu of fractional shares, and (iii) delivered to the holder of such Certificate, in exchange therefor, its  _pro rata_ portion of the Notes deliverable to the Stockholders.   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Acquiror Stock with a record date after the Effective Date shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Acquiror Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate surrenders such Certificate.    ##### 

  

  

Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing
whole shares of Acquiror Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
at the time of such surrender, the amount of any such dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Date which would have
been previously payable (but for the provisions of this _Section 1.7(c))_
with respect to such shares of Acquiror Stock.   

 (d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for shares of Acquiror Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that (i) the Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, (ii) the Person requesting such exchange will have paid to the Acquiror any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Acquiror Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of the Acquiror that such tax has been paid or is not payable and (iii) the Person requesting such exchange will have provided to the Acquiror an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Acquiror that such exchange complies with all applicable federal and state securities laws. For purposes of this Agreement, "Person" means any natural person, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, proprietorship, other business organization, trust, union, association or any governmental, regulatory or administrative body, agency, subdivision or authority, any court or judicial authority, or any public, private or industry regulatory authority, whether national, Federal, state, local, foreign or otherwise (a "Governmental Authority").   

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 1.7_, no party hereto or any of their respective agents shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   

 1.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of Acquiror Stock issued in exchange for the surrender of Certificates for Company Common Stock held by the Stockholders on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were held by the Stockholders immediately prior to the Closing. If, after the Closing, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_.   

 1.9 _Exemption from Registration_. The shares of Acquiror Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be issued in a transaction exempt from registration under (a) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), by reason of Rule 506 promulgated thereunder, and (b) applicable state securities laws.   

 1.10 _Private Placement of Shares; Registration Rights; Legends_.   

 (a) _Private Placement of Shares_. All of the shares of Acquiror Stock issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by the Stockholders in connection with the Merger will be subject to the restrictions upon transfer of such shares as    ##### 

  

  

imposed on unregistered shares by the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The Acquiror Stock issued in connection with the Merger
will be "restricted securities" under the Securities Act and Rule 144
promulgated thereunder and may only be sold or otherwise transferred pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws or pursuant to an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws.

 (c) _Legends_. Each certificate representing shares of Acquiror Stock issued in connection with the Merger shall bear a legend describing the restrictions described in _Section 1.10(a)_ and _Section 1.10(b)_.   

 1.11 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and the Merger Subsidiary, the officers and directors of the Company and the Merger Subsidiary are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.
