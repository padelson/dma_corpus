<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this &#147;Agreement&#148;) is made and entered
into as of September&nbsp;16, 2004 by and among Laureate Education, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (the &#147;Acquiror&#148;), Laureate Acquisition Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (the &#147;Merger
Subsidiary&#148;) and Walden e-Learning, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">RECITALS



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acquiror, the Merger Subsidiary and the Company believe it is in the
best interests of their respective companies and the stockholders of their
respective companies that the Company and the Merger Subsidiary combine into a
single company through the statutory merger of the Company with and into the
Merger Subsidiary (the &#147;Merger&#148;), with the Merger Subsidiary surviving the
Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, each outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the &#147;Company Common
Stock&#148;), other than those held by the Acquiror, shall be converted into (i)
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Acquiror (the
&#147;Acquiror Stock&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;Notes (as defined in Section&nbsp;1.6(b) below) to be
issued by the Acquiror representing in the aggregate, $19&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of section 368(a) of the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acquiror, the Merger Subsidiary and the Company desire to make certain
representations and warranties and other agreements in connection with the
Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby

held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall, to the extent
possible, be modified in such manner as to be valid, legal and enforceable but
so as to most nearly retain the intent of the parties, and if such modification
is not possible, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement. In
either case, the balance of this Agreement shall be interpreted as if such
provision were so modified or excluded, as the case may be, and shall be
enforceable in accordance with its terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.9 <U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Agreement, together with the exhibits and

and agreements, whether written or oral, and no party shall be liable or bound
to any other party in any manner by any warranties, representations or
covenants except as specifically set forth herein.

as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.
