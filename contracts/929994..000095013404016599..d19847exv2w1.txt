                    PLAN OF MERGER AND ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

         This PLAN OF MERGER AND ACQUISITION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is
entered into as of November 4, 2004 by and among EXTENDICARE HEALTH SERVICES,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer"); ALPHA ACQUISITION, INC., a Nevada
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer ("Alpha Acquisition")
having its principal office at 111 West Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin
53203 (the Buyer and Alpha Acquisition are referred to herein collectively as
the "Acquiring Companies" and individually as an "Acquiring Company"); and
ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC., a Nevada corporation (the "Company") having its
principal office at 1349 Empire Central, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas 75247. The
Acquiring Companies and the Company are referred to collectively herein as the
"Parties" and individually as a "Party." Capitalized terms used herein shall
have the meanings set forth therefor in Annex A.

                                    RECITALS:

         A. The respective boards of directors of the Acquiring Companies and
the Company have approved this Agreement and the merger of Alpha Acquisition
with and into the Company (the "Merger"), in accordance with Chapter 92A of the
Nevada Revised Statutes (the "Nevada Act") and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, whereby each Share issued and outstanding prior to the Merger
will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
provided for herein.

         B. The board of directors of the Company has determined that the Merger
is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.

         C. The Acquiring Companies and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

         Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
promises herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties,
and covenants herein contained, the Parties agree that the foregoing recitals
are true and correct and further agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1
                                   THE MERGER

         1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Nevada Act, Alpha Acquisition
shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Alpha Acquisition shall
cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation") as a corporation incorporated and existing under the
laws of the State of Nevada under the name "Alpha, Inc.", and the Surviving
Corporation shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations of
Alpha Acquisition and shall continue to hold all rights and obligations of the
Company as in effect prior to the Merger, all in accordance with the Nevada Act.

                                       1

<PAGE>

         1.2 THE CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place on a date to be specified by the Parties (the "Closing Date"), which shall
be no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, at the offices of Andrews Kurth
LLP in Houston, Texas, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by
the Parties.

         1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
Company and Alpha Acquisition shall file with the Secretary of State of the
State of Nevada Articles of Merger (the "Articles of Merger") executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Nevada Act and shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the Nevada Act to effect the Merger
as soon as practicable on or before the Closing Date. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with and
accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, or at such later time
as the Acquiring Companies and the Company shall agree and shall specify in the
Articles of Merger (the "Effective Time").

         1.4 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the Nevada Act. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the Nevada Act and to any other
applicable laws, at the Effective Time, all of the properties, rights,
privileges, powers, franchises and licenses of Alpha Acquisition shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation without reversion or impairment, without further act
or deed, and without any transfer or assignment having occurred; all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of Alpha Acquisition shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the
Surviving Corporation; all properties, rights, privileges, powers, franchises
and licenses of the Company shall remain and continue in the Company, as the
Surviving Corporation, without reversion or impairment, without further act or
deed, and without any transfer or assignment having occurred; and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Company shall remain
and continue as debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the
Company, as the Surviving Corporation.

         1.5 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. By virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any holder of the Shares or the holder of the shares of
common stock of Alpha Acquisition, as of the Effective Time:

                  (a) COMMON STOCK. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00
         per share, of Alpha Acquisition issued and outstanding immediately
         prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and
         nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
         Surviving Corporation.

                  (b) CONVERSION OF THE COMPANY SHARES. Each Share issued and
         outstanding as of the Effective Time (other than any Shares (i) held by
         the Acquiring Companies, (ii) held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
         the Acquiring Companies, (iii) in the treasury of the Company or (iv)
         held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, which Shares, by
         virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
         thereof, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist with no payment
         being made with respect thereto, and other than Dissenting Shares)
         shall automatically be converted into the right to receive US$18.50 in
         cash (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"). The aggregate amount of
         the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of all Shares entitled
         thereto,

                                       2

<PAGE>

         and the aggregate amount payable to holders of Stock Options pursuant
         to Section 1.10, are collectively referred to as the "Merger
         Consideration."

                  (c) DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding anything in this
         Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding
         immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder
         who was entitled to demand, and has validly demanded, dissenter's
         rights in accordance with Section 92A of the Nevada Act (the
         "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive
         the Per Share Merger Consideration unless and until such holder shall
         have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
         holder's dissenter's rights under the Nevada Act but instead shall be
         converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving
         Corporation with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
         the Nevada Act. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or
         shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's dissenter's
         rights, then each of such holder's Shares shall be treated as a Share
         that had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
         receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
         1.5(b).

                  (d) CANCELLATION OF SHARES. As of the Effective Time, all
         Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
         Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall no longer be
         outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
         exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any Shares
         outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time being converted
         into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant
         to Section 1.5(b) (each a "Certificate" and collectively, the
         "Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
         except the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Per Share Merger
         Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares formerly represented
         by the Certificate, to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender
         of such Certificate in accordance with Section 1.9(b).

         1.6 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION.
From the Effective Time until thereafter amended as provided by law, the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation.

         1.7 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

                  (a) The directors of Alpha Acquisition immediately prior to
         the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
         each to hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation
         and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (b) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the
         Company shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
         earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
         successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be, in
         accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
         Surviving Corporation.

         1.8 ASSETS, LIABILITIES, RESERVES AND ACCOUNTS. At the Effective Time,
the assets, liabilities, reserves and accounts of Alpha Acquisition and the
Company shall be taken up on the

                                       3

<PAGE>

books of the Surviving Corporation in such manner as may be appropriate to give
effect to the Merger in accordance with GAAP.

         1.9 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

                  (a) PAYING AGENT; PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION. Prior to
         the Effective Time, the Buyer shall appoint a bank or trust company
         reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
         "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration for the
         benefit of the Stockholders and the Option Holders. On or before the
         Closing, the Buyer shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) the Merger
         Consideration (such cash consideration being hereinafter referred to as
         the "Merger Fund") with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
         Stockholders and the Option Holders. The Merger Fund shall not include
         Per Share Merger Consideration for any Dissenting Shares, and the
         holders of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to receive payment
         of the Per Share Merger Consideration related to such Dissenting Shares
         from the Merger Fund. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
         instructions of the Buyer given on the Closing Date, transfer to the
         Surviving Corporation such amount as is necessary to pay the Option
         Holders all amounts due to them under Section 1.10 and to make other
         payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Merger Fund. The Merger
         Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

                  (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective Time
         (but not later than five (5) Business Days after the date on which the
         Effective Time occurs), the Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
         or deliver to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
         record of Shares and whose Shares are being converted into the right to
         receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(b) a
         letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and specify
         that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
         Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
         Paying Agent and shall otherwise be in a form and have such other
         provisions as the Buyer may reasonably specify) containing instructions
         for use by holders of Certificates to effect the exchange of their
         Certificates for the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided herein.
         As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of an
         outstanding Certificate or Certificates shall, upon surrender to the
         Paying Agent of such Certificate or Certificates and such letter of
         transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the
         instructions thereto (together with such other documents as the Paying
         Agent may reasonably request) and acceptance thereof by the Paying
         Agent (or, if such shares are held in book-entry or other
         uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent
         of the surrender of such Shares on a book-entry account statement (it
         being understood that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be
         deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating
         to the ownership of Shares), be entitled to an amount of cash (payable
         by check) equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the
         number of Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or
         Certificates. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
         compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying
         Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
         with normal exchange practices. If cash is to be remitted to a Person
         other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered for
         exchange is registered, it shall be a condition of such

                                       4

<PAGE>

         exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
         endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for
         transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
         Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
         payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to a Person other than
         the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered, or shall
         establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax either
         has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
         by this Section 1.9(b), at any time after the Effective Time, each
         Certificate shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive the
         Per Share Merger Consideration upon such surrender as contemplated by
         Section 1.5. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash
         payable as Per Share Merger Consideration.

                  (c) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN SHARES EXCHANGED FOR CASH.
         All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates formerly
         representing Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article 1
         shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
         pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates, and
         there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
         transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares which were
         issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
         after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
         Corporation for transfer, then they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
         provided in this Article 1.

                  (d) TERMINATION OF MERGER FUND. Any portion of the Merger Fund
         which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for twelve
         (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer,
         and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with
         this Article 1 shall thereafter look only to the Buyer for payment of
         the Merger Consideration, subject to escheat and abandoned property and
         similar laws.

                  (e) NO LIABILITY. None of the Parties or the Paying Agent
         shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Merger
         Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
         abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

                  (f) INVESTMENT OF MERGER FUND. The Paying Agent shall invest
         any cash in the Merger Fund, as directed by the Buyer; provided,
         however, that such investments shall be in obligations of, or
         guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper
         obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service,
         Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates
         of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
         commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion. Any interest and
         other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
         Buyer.

                  (g) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. The Buyer or the Paying Agent shall be
         entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
         payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts
         as the Buyer or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
         with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
         provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that
         amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Buyer or the Paying Agent,
         such withheld amounts shall

                                       5

<PAGE>

         be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
         the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and
         withholding was made by the Buyer or the Paying Agent.

                  (h) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been
         lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
         by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
         and, if required by the Buyer, the posting by such Person of a bond in
         such reasonable amount as the Buyer may require as indemnity against
         any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
         the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
         destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration payable
         pursuant to this Agreement.

         1.10 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON STOCK OPTIONS.

                  (a) VESTING OF STOCK OPTIONS. Subject to the applicable
         provisions of the Stock Plan, at, or immediately prior to, the
         Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company or any committee
         administering the Stock Plan shall take all actions necessary, and
         obtain all consents necessary, if any, so that all outstanding Stock
         Options heretofore granted under the Stock Plan shall become fully
         vested and exercisable at the Effective Time and shall be cancelled in
         exchange for the right to receive a cash payment from the Acquiring
         Companies of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Per
         Share Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of the
         Shares subject to such Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of
         Shares for which such Stock Option shall not theretofore have been
         exercised. Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than five
         (5) business days after the date on which the Effective Time occurs),
         the Acquiring Companies shall pay the Option Holders the cash payments
         specified in this Section 1.10(a).

                  (b) TERMINATION OF THE STOCK PLAN. The Stock Plan shall
         terminate as of the Effective Time, and the provisions in any other
         agreement, arrangement or benefit plan providing for the issuance,
         transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest
         in respect of any capital stock of the Company in connection with such
         Stock Plan shall be of no further force and effect as of the Effective
         Time, and the Company shall take such actions to ensure that following
         the Effective Time no Option Holder or any participant in or a party to
         the Stock Plan or other agreement, arrangement or benefit plan shall
         have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock or any interest
         in respect of any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (c) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. The Acquiring Companies will be
         entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable
         pursuant to this Section 1.10 to any Option Holder such amounts as the
         Acquiring Companies are required to deduct and withhold with respect to
         the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state,
         local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
         and withheld by the Acquiring Companies, such withheld amounts shall be
         treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
         Option Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
         made by the Acquiring Companies.

respect to any material Policy of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have duly and timely made all claims that they have
been entitled to make under each Policy, other than such claims, the failure of
which to make has not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect. There is no claim pending by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any Policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied
or disputed by the underwriters of such Policies, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no basis for denial of any claim under any Policy as a result
of the applications and information provided by the Company to obtain such
Policies. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice from or on behalf of any insurance carrier issuing any Policy
that insurance rates therefore will hereafter be substantially increased (except
to the extent that insurance rates may be increased for all similarly situated
risks) or that there will hereafter be a cancellation or an increase in a
deductible (or an increase in premiums in order to maintain an existing
deductible) or nonrenewal of any such Policy.

of the Company, threatened by any Governmental Entities to revoke, withdraw,
modify, restrict or suspend any Company Permit or fine the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no event has occurred which, with or without the giving of
notice, the passage of time, or both, has resulted in, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, a revocation, withdrawal, modification, restriction or
suspension of any Company Permit or imposition of a fine against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, except for any such events that have not, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries make no representations or
warranties under this Section 3.13 as to permits or licenses relating to

         created thereby, the operation of the Benefit Plans and the actions of
         any fiduciaries with respect to the Benefit Plans are (and since
         January 1, 2002 have been) in material compliance with, and conform
         (and since January 1, 2002 have conformed) in all material respects to,
         the requirements of applicable provisions of the Code, ERISA and other
         applicable statutes and governmental rules and regulations, and each
         Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms.

                  (e) Neither the Company nor any Benefits Affiliate has any
         material plan termination or withdrawal liability with respect to any
         Benefit Plan that is (i) a defined benefit pension plan subject to
         Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a plan subject to the requirements of Code
         Section 412 or 4971, or (iii) a multiemployer pension plan, as that
         term is defined in sections 4001(a)(3) and 3(37) of ERISA; and if any

         any Benefit Plan.

                  (h) Each Benefit Plan which is intended to be a qualified plan
         under Code Section 401(a) has received a determination letter that
         takes into account the so-called "GUST" amendments.

                  (i) Other than as may be required under Sections 601 through
         609 of ERISA or under any applicable state continuation law, neither
         the Company, any Benefits Affiliate or any Benefit Plan provides, or
         has any obligation to provide, or contribute toward the cost of,
         post-retirement welfare benefits with respect to any employees,
         including post-retirement medical, dental, prescription drug, life
         insurance, severance or any other similar benefit, whether provided on
         an insured or self-insured basis.

                  (j) Except as provided in Section 1.10, the consummation of

         prohibited transaction described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section

                  (k) Neither the Company nor any Benefits Affiliate are parties
         to any contract, agreement or arrangement which provides for the
         payment of compensation for which such entities would not be entitled
         to claim a deduction for federal income tax purposes through the
         operation of Sections 162(m) or 280G or any other provision of the
         Code.

                  (l) Neither the Company nor any Benefits Affiliate have been
         involved in any transaction that could cause the Company or any current

         3.21 BROKERS OR FINDERS. The Company represents, as to itself, its

<PAGE>

         lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions
         or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any nonpublic information
         to, any Person or group of Persons (other than the Acquiring Companies)
         in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise cooperate with
         or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries,
         proposals, discussions or negotiations or (iii) accept an Acquisition
         Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle
         providing for or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
         agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon,
         terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
         breach its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything in this
         Section 4.7 to the contrary, the Company may furnish or disclose
         nonpublic information to its lessors and lenders, in their capacity as
         such.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
         Section 4.7(a), if at any time prior to obtaining Stockholder Approval,
         (i) the Company and its Representatives have otherwise complied with
         the obligations under this Section 4.7(b) and the Company has received
         an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the
         board of directors of the Company or the Special Committee believes in
         good faith to be bona fide, (ii) the board of directors of the Company
         or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation
         with its outside legal counsel and after taking into account the advice
         of its independent financial advisors that (A) the Person or group of
         Persons submitting such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably capable of
         consummating such Acquisition Proposal taking into account the legal,
         financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal
         and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably
         be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (iii) after
         consultation with its outside legal counsel, the board of directors of
         the Company or the Special Committee determines in good faith that
         taking such action is necessary for the board of directors of the
         Company or the Special Committee to comply with its fiduciary duties
         under applicable law, then the Company may (x) furnish information with
         respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of
         Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and (y) participate in
         discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making
         such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal;
         provided, however, that prior to furnishing any such information or
         participating in any such discussions or negotiations, (1) the Company
         provides written notice to the Buyer of the identity of the Person or
         group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and the material
         terms and conditions thereof and the Company receives from such Person
         or group of Persons an executed confidentiality agreement containing
         terms no less restrictive than the terms of the Confidentiality
         Agreement, dated as of July 7, 2004, as amended, between the Buyer and
         the Company, and (2) the Company furnishes such information to the
         Buyer (to the extent such information has not been previously delivered
         or made available by the Company to the Buyer).

                  (c) Nothing contained in this Section 4.7 shall prohibit the
         Company or the board of directors of the Company from taking and
         disclosing to the Stockholders a position with respect to a tender or
         exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
         promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure
         if, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the
         Company, after consultation

                                       25

<PAGE>

         with its outside legal counsel, failure to do so would result in a
         violation of applicable law.

                  (d) Neither the board of directors of the Company nor any
         committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, withdraw (or modify in
         a manner adverse to the Buyer and Alpha Acquisition), or propose to
         withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to the Buyer and Alpha
         Acquisition), the approval, recommendation or declaration of
         advisability by such board of directors or any such committee thereof
         of this Agreement, or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
         by this Agreement (any such action being referred to as an "Adverse
         Recommendation Change"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
         prior to obtaining Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of the
         Company or any committee thereof may make an Adverse Recommendation
         Change if the members of such board of directors or any committee
         thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
         counsel, that taking such action is necessary to comply with its
         fiduciary duties under applicable law.

                  (e) Neither the board of directors of the Company nor any
         committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, approve, adopt or
         recommend, or propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter
         of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
         agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
         agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement
         constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably
         be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, the Company shall not be prohibited from entering into a
         definitive agreement with respect to an unsolicited, bona fide and
         written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted after the date of this
         Agreement and prior to obtaining Stockholder Approval by a third party
         if (i) the Company and its Representatives have otherwise complied with
         the obligations under this Section 4.7, (ii) the Company provides Buyer
         with written notice at least five Business Days prior to any meeting of
         the board of directors of the Company at which such board of directors
         will consider whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
         Proposal, during which five-Business Day period the Company shall cause
         its financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good faith with Buyer
         in an effort to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
         this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the
         transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms, (iii)
         notwithstanding such negotiations and adjustments pursuant to clause
         (ii) above, the board of directors of the Company makes the
         determination necessary for such Acquisition Proposal to constitute a
         Superior Proposal, (iv) the board of directors of the Company
         determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of
         its outside legal counsel, that taking such action is necessary for the
         board of directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary duties
         under applicable law, (v) the Company does not approve or recommend or
         enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition
         Proposal at any time before the day that is the fifth Business Day
         after Buyer receives written notice from the Company stating that the
         board of directors of the Company has determined such Acquisition
         Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (vi) on the date of the
         approval or recommendation of, or execution of a definitive agreement
         with respect to, any such Superior Proposal, the Company makes the
         payments

                                       26

         required to be made pursuant to Section 4.8(b) (any such definitive
         agreement being referred to herein as a "Permitted Alternative
         Agreement").

                  (f) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
         this Section 4.7, from and after the date hereof, the Company will (i)
         keep the Buyer generally informed on a reasonably prompt basis of the
         status of and material developments respecting any solicitations,
         inquiries, proposals and/or negotiations (including the identity of the
         Person making any such inquiry, solicitation or proposal and as to the
         material terms and price in respect of any Acquisition Proposal), (ii)
         provide to the Buyer as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
         thereof with copies of all written acquisition proposals sent or
         provided to the Company or its Representatives from any Person and
         (iii) provide the required notice to the Buyer of any intent to take
         any of the actions described in Section 4.7(e) or to terminate this
         Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or to enter into a Permitted
         Alternative Agreement (it being understood that the Company shall not
         be entitled to take any of the actions described in Section 4.7(e), or
         to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(c), unless
         and until it fully complies with Section 4.7(e)).

                  (g) The Company and its Representatives shall immediately
         cease any discussions or negotiations, if any, with any other parties
         that may be ongoing as of the date hereof with respect to any
         Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, within five (5) Business Days
         after the date of this Agreement, request each Person who has
         heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
         consideration of acquiring the Company or any portion thereof to return
         or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
         Person by or on behalf of the Company. The Company represents and
         warrants to the Acquiring Companies that neither the Company nor any of
         its Representatives has any agreement, arrangement or understanding in
         connection with any party's proposed acquisition of the Company that,
         directly or indirectly, would be violated or require any payments in
         the nature of a topping or break-up fee, expense reimbursement or the
         like by reason of the execution of this Agreement and/or consummation
         of the Merger.

         4.8 FEES AND EXPENSES.

                  (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.8, all
         costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
         transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by the party incurring
         such costs and expenses.

                  (b) If (i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
         Section 7.1(c), (ii) the Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to
         Section 7.1(d), (iii) the Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to
         Section 7.1(f) or (iv) the Company or the Buyer terminate this
         Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.1(b) or 7.1(i) and in the case of such
         a termination pursuant to Sections 7.1(b) or 7.1(i) (A) at any time
         after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination an
         Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
         publicly communicated to the Stockholders generally and (B) prior to
         the twelve month anniversary of such termination, the Company shall
         enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
         Proposal or an

                                       27

<PAGE>

         Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall, in the
         case of clause (i), as provided in Section 4.7(e)(vi), in the case of
         clauses (ii) or (iii), not later than one Business Day following such
         termination, or in the case of clause (iv) not later than one Business
         Day following the entering into of a definitive agreement with respect
         to, or the consummation of, an Acquisition Proposal prior to the twelve
         month anniversary of such termination, as applicable, (I) reimburse the
         Buyer in immediately available funds for the documented out-of-pocket
         fees and expenses (but in no event greater than $2,000,000) incurred by
         the Buyer in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
         contemplated hereby and any related financing and (II) in the case of
         clauses (i), (ii) or (iv), pay to the Buyer in immediately available
         funds an amount equal to $6,000,000. The Company acknowledges that the
         agreements contained in this Section 4.8(b) are an integral part of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
         agreements, the Buyer and Alpha Acquisition would not enter into this
         Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the amount due
         pursuant to this Section 4.8(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
         the Buyer commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
         Company for the fee set forth in this Section 4.8(b), the Company shall
         pay to the Buyer its costs and expenses (including reasonable
         attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together
         with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate as set forth
         in the Midwest Edition of The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
         such payment was required to be made.

                  (c) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
         Section 7.1(e), then the Buyer shall, not later than one Business Day
         following such termination, reimburse the Company in immediately
         available funds for the documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (but
         in no event greater than $2,000,000) incurred by the Company in
         connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
         hereby. The Acquiring Companies acknowledge that the agreements
         contained in this Section 4.8(c) are an integral part of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
         agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement;
         accordingly, if the Buyer fails to pay the amount due pursuant to this
         Section 4.8(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company
         commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Buyer for the
         fee set forth in this Section 4.8(c), the Buyer shall pay to the
         Company its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
         and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on
         the amount of the fee at the prime rate as set forth in the Midwest
         Edition of The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment
         was required to be made.

                             POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

         The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the
Closing:

         5.1 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND PRACTICES.

                  (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
         Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall honor in accordance with their
         terms all of the existing employment, severance, consulting and salary
         continuation agreements between the Company or any

                                       28

<PAGE>

         of its Subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director,
         employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
         group of such officers, directors, employees or consultants that are
         set forth on Schedule 5.1(a).

                  (b) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the
         Surviving Corporation shall not materially and adversely alter the
         benefits (including health benefits, severance policies and general
         employment policies and procedures) that are available to employees of
         the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof (other than
         modifications to any employee benefit plans in the ordinary course of
         business consistent with past practice and other than with respect to
         any equity-based compensation). Nothing in this Section 5.1(b) shall be
         deemed to prevent the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
         from making any change required by applicable law.

                  (c) To the extent permitted under applicable law, each
         employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be given credit for
         all service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or service credited
         by the Company or its Subsidiaries) under all employee benefit plans,
         programs, policies and arrangements maintained by the Surviving
         Corporation and its Subsidiaries in which they participate or in which
         they become participants for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
         benefit accrual (but not benefit accrual in any defined benefit pension
         plan) including, for purposes of determining (i) short-term and
         long-term disability benefits, (ii) severance benefits, (iii) vacation
         benefits and (iv) benefits under any retirement plan.

                  (d) This Section 5.1 shall survive the consummation of the
         Merger at the Effective Time and shall continue without limit except as
         expressly set forth herein.

         5.2 INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE.

                  (a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from
         liability for acts and omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
         Time and rights to advancements of expenses relating thereto now
         existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers,
         employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
         "Indemnitees") as provided in their respective charters and/or bylaws
         (or similar organizational documents) or in any indemnification
         agreement as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger
         and, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, such provisions
         shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that
         would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such Indemnitees,
         unless an alteration or modification of such documents is required by
         applicable law or each Indemnitee affected thereby otherwise consents
         in writing thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
         from and after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall
         indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee against all claims, losses,
         liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
         expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
         connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
         whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
         of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnitee is or was an
         officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
         Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and
         actions contemplated hereby),

                                       29

<PAGE>

         whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
         to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Each Indemnity
         shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
         any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving
         Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Surviving
         Corporation from the Indemnitee of a request thereof; provided,
         however, that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
         undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
         such a Person is not entitled to indemnification. If any claim or
         claims are asserted or made as to matters subject to the foregoing
         indemnity provisions within such six-year period, all rights to
         indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue
         until the disposition thereof. The Buyer shall take all commercially
         reasonable steps necessary to assure compliance with the foregoing
         covenants.

                  (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the
         Surviving Corporation shall, and the Buyer shall (in the event of a
         failure by the Surviving Corporation to do so), maintain, at no expense
         to the beneficiaries thereof, the current policies of officers' and
         directors' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in
         respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
         Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), so
         long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of
         $1,050,000 (such $1,050,000 the "Maximum Premium"). If the Company's
         existing insurance expires, is terminated or cancelled during such
         six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving
         Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be, shall obtain as much
         directors' and officers' liability insurance as can be obtained for the
         remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the
         Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
         Indemnitees than the Company's existing directors' and officers'
         liability insurance, covering Indemnitees who are currently covered by
         the Company's existing officers' and directors' or fiduciary liability
         insurance policies.

                  (c) In the event that the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
         or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
         merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
         corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
         all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
         proper provisions shall be made so that such Person assumes the
         obligations set forth in this Section 5.2, and Buyer shall cause such
         Person to assume such obligations.

                  (d) This Section 5.2, which shall survive the consummation of
         the Merger at the Effective Time and shall continue for the periods
         specified herein, is intended to benefit the Indemnitees, each of whom
         are intended third-party beneficiaries and may enforce the provisions
         of this Section 5.2.

         5.3 NO STOCKHOLDERS LIABILITY. No actions taken by the Acquiring
Companies, whether in connection with the financing of the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise, will result in any liability or obligation on
the part of the Stockholders, whether arising in connection with fraudulent
conveyance laws or otherwise. This Section 5.3, which shall survive the
consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the
Stockholders, each of whom are intended third-party beneficiaries and may
enforce the provisions of this Section 5.3.

         and (B), of Governmental Entities (other than lenders under financing
         agreements) required in order to consummate the transaction
         contemplated by this Agreement or necessary for the lawful conduct of

         qualified shall be true and correct in all material respects, in each
         case, as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
         Date (provided that, to the extent that any such representation or

         correct as of such specified date);

                  (b) the Acquiring Companies shall have performed and complied
         with all of their covenants hereunder in all material respects through

         Companies, a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
         or agreement contained in this Agreement which is not curable or, if

         Effective Time, there shall have occurred, on the part of the Company,

         agreement contained in this Agreement which is not curable or, if

         such breach is given by the Buyer to the Company, except, in any case,
         such failures which are not reasonably like to adversely affect the
         Company's ability to consummate the Merger;

                  (g) the Company may terminate this Agreement if there has been
         a failure of satisfaction of a condition to the obligations of the

         before February 28, 2005, either the Buyer or the Company may terminate
         this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to the other Party
         prior to Closing (unless the failure to close results primarily from
         the Party that elects to terminate because it has breached any covenant
         contained in this Agreement); provided, however, that the Buyer or the
         Company may elect to extend such date by no more than thirty (30) days
         if the condition set forth in Section 6.1(i) or Section 6.2(g),
         respectively, has not been satisfied by such date.

stockholders; provided, however, that (i) Section 4.8, this Section 7.2, Article
8 and the confidentiality and other provisions contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement shall each survive termination and (ii) no such termination shall
release any Party from liability (which liability shall not be limited by
Section 4.8) for a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement.
