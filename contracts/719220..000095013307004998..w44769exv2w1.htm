ARTICLE III 

   

CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES  

  

 Section 3.01 _Merger Consideration_. (a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any action on the part of any Person, each share of Seller Common Stock (excluding Company-Owned Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the election of the holder thereof (in accordance with the election and allocation procedures set forth in Section 3.01(b), (e), (h), (i) and (j)) into either (i) the right to receive $31.00 in cash without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") or (ii) an amount of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the quotient, carried to four decimal places (the " _Stock Exchange Ratio_ ") of (A) $31.00 divided by (B) the Purchaser Share Price (as defined below) of a share of Purchaser Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event may the Stock Exchange Ratio be less than 0.93 or greater than 0.97. If the Stock Exchange Ratio otherwise would be less than 0.93 or greater than 0.97, then 0.93 or 0.97, respectively, shall be used. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Purchaser Share Price_ " of the Purchaser Common Stock shall be the average of the high and low sale prices of Purchaser Common Stock (as reported on Nasdaq or, if not reported thereon, in another authoritative source) for each of the twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding the date of the Seller Meeting (as defined in Section 6.02). The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the " _Merger Consideration._ " 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Election as to Outstanding Seller Common Stock_. The Seller shareholders (excluding Seller and Purchaser) will have the following options in connection with the exchange of their Seller Common Stock in connection with the Merger: 

  

 (i) AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER, all of such holders Seller Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be converted into and become the Stock Consideration (such election, the " _All Stock Election_ "), provided that fractional shares will not be issued and cash (payable by check) will be paid in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03; or 

   

 (ii) AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER, all of such holders Seller Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be converted into and become the Cash Consideration (such election, the " _All Cash Election_ "): or 

   

 (iii) AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER, such holders aggregate number of shares of Seller Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be converted into and become any combination of the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration (such election, the " _Mixed Election_ "); or 

   

 (iv) IF NO ELECTION (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3.01(d)) IS MADE BY THE HOLDER BY THE ELECTION DEADLINE (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3.01(e)), all of such holders shares of Seller Common Stock shall be deemed to be "Non-Election Shares" and shall be convertible at the discretion of Purchaser into either the Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration, or a combination thereof, subject to the allocation and proration provisions in Section 3.01(g)(h) and (i). 

   

 (c) _Company-Owned Stock_. Each share of Seller Common Stock held as Company-Owned Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor. 

  

 (d) _Outstanding Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and unaffected by the Merger. 

  

 (e) _Procedures for Election_. An election form and other appropriate transmittal materials in such form as Seller and Purchaser shall mutually agree (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed to shareholders of Seller concurrent with or immediately after the mailing of the Proxy/Prospectus. The " _Election Deadline_ " shall be the business day prior to the date of the Seller Meeting, after which an Election may not be made. 

  

 (f) _Perfection of the Election_. An Election shall be considered to have been validly made by a Seller shareholder only if the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 3.04) shall have received an Election Form properly completed and executed by such shareholder prior to the Election Deadline. Holders of record of shares of Seller Common Stock who hold such 

   ##### 

  

 

shares as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities (a "
_Representative_ ") may submit multiple Election Forms, provided that such
Representative certifies that each such Election Form covers all the shares of
Seller Common Stock held by that Representative for a particular beneficial
owner. 

   

 (g) _Revocation of Election_. Any Seller shareholder may at any time prior to the Election Deadline revoke such shareholders election and submit a new Election Form in accordance with the procedures in Section 3.01(e) by providing written notice that is received by the Exchange Agent by 5:00 p.m., local time for the Exchange Agent, on the business day prior to the Election Deadline. Elections may be similarly revoked if the Effective Date does not occur by September 30, 2008. 

  

 (h) _Limitations on Stock Consideration_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement (other than Section 3.01(j)), 55% of the total number of shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time (excluding shares of Seller Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in Section 3.01(b)) (the " _Stock Conversion Number_ ") shall be converted into the Stock Consideration and the remaining outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock (excluding shares of Seller Common Stock to be canceled as provided in Section 3.01(b)) shall be converted into the Cash Consideration. 

  

 (i) _Allocation and Proration_. To the extent necessary to satisfy the limitations in Section 3.01(g), within three business days after the Election Deadline, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among holders of Seller Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows: 

  

 (i) If the number of shares of Seller Common Stock with respect to which holders have elected to receive the Stock Consideration (whether in All-Stock Elections or in Mixed Elections) (the " _Stock Election Number_ ") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all shares with respect to which holders have made the Cash Election (" _Cash Election Shares_ ") and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive (A) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (2) the Stock Exchange Ratio by (3) a fraction the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number (the " _Stock Proration Factor_ ") and (B) cash in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (2) the Cash Consideration by (3) one minus the Stock Proration Factor; 

   

 (ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the "S _hortfall Number_ "), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner: 

    ##### 

  

     

 (A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and each holder of Non-Election Shares shall receive (1) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) the Stock Exchange Ratio by (z) a fraction the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (the " _Non-Election Proration Factor_ ") and (B) cash in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) the Cash Consideration by (z) one minus the Non-Election Proration Factor; or 

  

 (B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and each holder of Cash Election Shares shall receive (1) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) the Stock Exchange Ratio by (z) a fraction the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares and the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares (the " _Cash Proration Factor_ ") and (B) cash in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) the Cash Consideration by (z) one minus the Cash Proration Factor. 

  

 (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of one hundred (100) or fewer shares of Seller Common Stock of record on the date of this Agreement who have elected the All Cash Election shall not be required to have any of their shares of Seller Common Stock converted into Purchaser Common Stock. 

   

 (j) _Tax Treatment of the Parent Merger_. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Parent Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if necessary to assure that the Parent Merger will not fail to satisfy continuity of interest requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, as reasonably determined by counsel to Purchaser, Purchaser shall increase the number of outstanding Seller Common Stock that will be converted into Purchaser Common Stock in the Parent Merger and reduce the number of outstanding Seller Common Stock that will be converted into the right to receive cash in the Parent Merger. 

   

 Section 3.02 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers._ At the Effective Time, holders of Seller Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of Seller, other than to receive any dividend or other distribution with respect to such Seller Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time and the consideration provided under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Seller or the Surviving Corporation of any shares of Seller Stock. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 3.03 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger; instead, Purchaser shall pay to each holder of Seller Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Purchaser Common Stock (after taking into account all Old Certificates (as defined below) delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fractional share of Purchaser Common Stock to which the holder would be entitled by the Purchaser Share Price. 

  

 Section 3.04 _Exchange Procedures._  

  

 (a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit in an escrow account of American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") at Purchaser Bank, for the benefit of the holders of certificates formerly representing shares of Seller Common Stock (" _Old Certificates_ ") an amount of cash necessary to make payments of cash to be paid as part of the Merger Consideration (together with any dividends or distributions with a record date occurring on or after the Effective Date with respect thereto without any interest on any such cash, dividends or distributions) and shall provide the Exchange Agent with the irrevocable authorization to issue sufficient shares of Purchaser Common Stock (" _New Certificates_ ") for those shares of Seller Common Stock being exchanged for Purchaser Common Stock in accordance with this Article III. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, but in any event within five business days after the Effective Date, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of an Old Certificate that has not previously submitted an Election Form, transmittal materials (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") for use in exchanging their Old Certificates for New Certificates and/or cash. The Letter of Transmittal will contain instructions with respect to the surrender of the Old Certificates and the receipt of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor. Upon the shareholders delivery to the Exchange Agent of Old Certificates owned by such shareholder representing shares of Seller Common Stock (or an indemnity affidavit reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and the Exchange Agent, if any, if such certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed), and the duly completed Letter of Transmittal, the Exchange Agent shall cause New Certificates into which such shares of Seller Common Stock are converted on the Effective Date to be delivered to such shareholder and/or any check in respect of cash to be paid as part of the Merger Consideration (and in respect of any fractional share interests, dividends or distributions that such shareholder shall be entitled to receive). No interest will be paid on any such cash to be paid in lieu of fractional share interests or in respect of dividends or distributions that any such shareholder shall be entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of Seller Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Purchaser Common Stock with a record date occurring on or after the Effective Date shall be paid to the record holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate representing shares of Seller Common Stock converted in the Merger into the right to receive shares of such Purchaser Common Stock until the holder thereof receives New Certificates in exchange therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.04. After becoming so entitled in accordance with this Section 3.04, the record holder thereof also shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock, and which such holder had the right to receive upon surrender of the Old Certificates. 

   

 Section 3.05 _Anti-Dilution Provisions._ In the event Purchaser changes the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding between the date hereof and the Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, split up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or similar transaction and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Date, the Stock Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted. In addition, in the event Purchaser enters into an agreement pursuant to which shares of Purchaser Common Stock would be converted into shares or other securities or obligations of another corporation, proper provision shall be made in such agreement so that each Seller shareholder entitled to receive shares of Purchaser Common Stock in the Merger shall be entitled to receive such number of shares or other securities or amount or obligations of such other corporation as such shareholder would be entitled to receive if the Effective Date had occurred immediately prior to the happening of such event. Furthermore, in any such event, the Cash Consideration shall also be proportionately adjusted. 

  

 Section 3.06 _Options._ On the Effective Date, whether or not then exercisable, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Seller Common Stock under the Seller Stock Plan (each, a "Seller Stock Option") shall be cancelled and each holder of a Seller Stock Option shall receive from Seller, in consideration of the cancellation all Seller Stock Options held by such option holder, an amount equal to the difference between $31.00 and the aggregate exercise price of such Seller Stock Options. Seller agrees to take the actions contemplated by Section 11(c)(ii) of the Seller Stock Plan to permit the cancellation of Seller Stock Options contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence.

more of its respective covenants contained in Article IV and Article VI;

 (ii) Since December 31, 2006, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen that, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances and events (described in any paragraph of Section 5.03 or otherwise), is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Purchaser, except as disclosed in the Purchaser SEC Documents.

furnish promptly to Purchaser (i) a copy of each material report, schedule
and other document filed by Seller pursuant to federal or state securities or
banking laws, and (ii) all other information concerning the business,

event, however, is Seller obligated to (i) provide access or disclose any
information to Purchaser where such access or disclosure would violate any
agreement not to disclose confidential information; or (ii) provide access to
board minutes that discuss of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any Acquisition Proposal or any other subject matter Seller
reasonably determines should be treated as confidential. 

  

 (b) Each of Purchaser and Seller agrees that it will not, and will cause its representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.05 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of law, each party will keep confidential, and will cause its representatives to keep confidential, all information and documents obtained pursuant to this Section 6.05 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the entering into of this Agreement) unless such information (i) was already known to such party, (ii) becomes available to such party from other sources not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the party to which such information pertains or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable from published information or trade sources.

 (a) Seller agrees that after the date hereof neither it nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of its respective officers and directors or the officers and directors of any of its subsidiaries shall, and it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its employees and agents, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or by any of its subsidiaries (collectively, its " _Representatives_ ") not to, initiate, solicit or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or implementation of any Acquisition Proposal, or, except to the extent that the Seller Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that such action is required in order for the Seller Board to comply with its fiduciary duties, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition 

   ##### 

  

    

Proposal or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to implement or make
an Acquisition Proposal (and in any event, Seller shall not provide any

orally and in writing, of (x) the receipt by it (or any of the other persons
referred to above) of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records Seller or any
of it Subsidiaries by any Person or entity that informs the Seller Board or
the board of directors of any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal and (y) the material terms and
conditions of such proposal or inquiry (whether written or oral) or
modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) keep Purchaser
fully informed of the status and details of any such proposal or inquiry and
any developments with respect thereto. Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements in
accordance with the terms thereof, and shall immediately take all steps
necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under
any such provisions authorizing any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal. "
_Significant Subsidiary_ " has the meaning ascribed to that term in Rule 1-02
of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
" _Exchange Act_ "). 

  

 (b) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Purchaser) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than Purchaser who have been furnished confidential information regarding Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information.

   ##### 

  

    

ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement from, or, if necessary, challenge the validity or applicability of,
any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. Neither party
will take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated
hereby not to comply with any Takeover Provisions and each of them will take
all necessary steps within its control to make those transactions comply with
(or continue to comply with) the Takeover Provisions. 

  

 Section 6.08 _Reports._ Each of Seller and Purchaser shall file (and shall cause Sellers Subsidiaries and Purchasers Subsidiaries, respectively, to file), between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, all reports required to be filed by it with the SEC and any other Regulatory Authorities having jurisdiction over such party, and Seller shall deliver to Purchaser copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed. Any financial statements contained in any reports to a Regulatory Authority shall be prepared in accordance with requirements applicable to such reports. 

  

 Section 6.09 _Nasdaq Listing._ Purchaser will use all reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event before the Effective Time.

Each party hereto agrees that it will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each of Purchaser and Seller shall, to the extent practicable, consult with the other on all material written information submitted to any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of such parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. 

  

 (b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or

application made by or on behalf of such other party or any of its
Subsidiaries to any third party or Governmental Authority. 

  

 Section 6.11 _Seller Employees; Director and Management; Indemnification._  

  

 (a) All employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be employed by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "). Such employment of the Continuing Employees shall be subject to Purchasers usual terms, conditions and policies of employment. Continuing Employees shall be entitled to participate in all benefit plans and programs on the same basis as other similarly- situated employees of Purchaser, including, but not limited to, vacation, health, life insurance, disability insurance, defined benefit pension plans and salary deferral plans. For the calendar year including the Effective Date, the Continuing Employees shall not be required to satisfy any deductible, co-payment, out-of-pocket maximum or similar requirements under the benefit plans maintained by Purchaser (or its Subsidiaries) that provide medical, dental and other welfare benefits (the " _Purchaser Welfare Plans_ ") to the extent of amounts previously credited for such purposes under the Seller Plans that provide medical, dental and other welfare benefits (the " _Seller Welfare Plans_ "). Any waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and requirements to show evidence of good health contained in such Purchaser Welfare Plans shall be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees (except to the extent any such waiting period, pre-existing condition exclusion, or requirement to show evidence of good health applied under the applicable Seller Welfare Plan in which the participant then participates or is otherwise eligible to participate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time). Continuing Employees will be given credit for their service with Seller for purposes of eligibility and vesting under all of Purchasers Welfare Plans and other employee benefit plans. This Section 6.11(a) shall not be construed to limit the ability of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any employee at any time for any reason or to review employee benefits programs from time to time and to make such changes as they deem appropriate. 

  

 (b) Purchaser agrees to honor, or to cause the appropriate Purchaser Subsidiary to honor, in accordance with their terms, all change in control agreements listed on Section 6.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary from amending or terminating any such agreement in accordance with its terms and applicable law. 

  

 (c) Effective immediately following the Effective Date, the Continuing Employees will be eligible for severance benefits and defined benefit pension plan coverage as set forth in Section 6.11(c) of the Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (d) No provision of this Section 6.11 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee, or any other employee or former employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent of any Continuing Employee, other 

   ##### 

  

    

employee or former employee) in respect of continued employment (or resumed
employment) or any other matter. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Date, Seller shall take all actions that may be requested by Purchaser in writing with respect to (i) causing one or more Plans to terminate as of the Effective Date, or as of the date immediately preceding the Effective Date, (ii) causing benefit accrual and entitlements under any Plan to cease as of the Effective Date, (iii) causing the continuation on and after the Effective Date of any contract, arrangement or insurance policy relating to any Plan for such period as may be requested by Purchaser, or (iv) facilitating the merger of any Plan into any employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser. 

  

 (f) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Date, a director or officer of Seller (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of Seller, or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Date, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. On and after the Effective Date, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Date), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with Purchaser;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) Purchaser shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption Purchaser shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Purchaser elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Purchaser and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after notification, and Purchaser shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) Purchaser shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties, (3) Purchaser shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and (4) Purchaser shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall

Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim Indemnification under this Section
6.11(f), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof, provided that the
failure of any Indemnified Party to so notify Purchaser shall not relieve it
of its obligations hereunder except (and only) to the extent that such
failure materially prejudices Purchaser. Purchasers obligations under this
Section 6.11(f) continue in full force and effect for a period of six years
from the Effective Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim (a " _Claim_ ") asserted or made
within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim. 

  

 (g) Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of the directors, officers and employees of Seller and any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Covered Parties_ ") as provided in their respective articles of incorporation, bylaws or similar governing documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Date shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, and shall be honored by such entities or their respective successors as if they were the indemnifying party thereunder, without any amendment thereto, for a period of six years from the Effective Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 6.11(g) shall be deemed to preclude the liquidation, consolidation or merger of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, in which case all of such rights to indemnification and limitations on liability shall be deemed to so survive and continue as an obligation of Purchaser or the successor to Seller or its Subsidiary notwithstanding any such liquidation, consolidation or merger. 

  

 (h) Purchaser, from and after the Effective Date will use its reasonable best efforts directly or indirectly to cause the persons who served as directors or officers of Seller on or before the Effective Date to be covered by Sellers existing directors and officers liability insurance policy (provided that Purchaser may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than such policy) but in no event shall any insured person be entitled under this Section 6.11(h) to insurance coverage more favorable than that provided to him or her in such capacities as of the date hereof with respect to acts or omissions resulting from their service as such on or prior to the Effective Date. Such insurance coverage, if reasonably available at a reasonable cost relative to the coverage obtained, shall commence on the Effective Date and will be provided for a period of no less than three years after the Effective Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be required to expend more than 150% of the current amount expended by Seller (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the Insurance Amount shall be deemed reasonable for purposes of this Section 6.11(h). Seller agrees to renew any such existing insurance or to purchase any "discovery period" insurance provided for thereunder at Purchasers request. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (i) In the event Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser assume the obligations set forth in this section. 

  

 (j) The provisions of Section 6.11(f), (g), (h) and (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and representatives. 

  

 (k) The parties agree to take the further actions Previously Disclosed by Purchaser. [See terms to be disclosed in Disclosure Schedule.] 

  

 Section 6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters._ Each of Seller and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein. 

  

 Section 6.13 _Dividend Coordination._ It is agreed by the parties hereto that they will cooperate to assure that as a result of the Merger, during any applicable period, there shall not be a payment of both a Purchaser and a Seller dividend. The parties further agree that if the Effective Date is at the end of a fiscal quarter, then they will cooperate to assure that the Seller shareholders receive the dividend declared by Purchaser, if any, rather than the dividend for that period, if any, declared by Seller. In no event, however, shall Seller shareholders fail to receive a dividend from either of Seller or Purchaser for any quarterly period (or portion thereof) between the date hereof and the Effective Date. 

  

 Section 6.14 _Board of Directors; Advisory Board._

 Section 6.16 _No Breaches of Representations and Warranties._ Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, without the written consent of the other party, each of Purchaser and Seller will not do any act or suffer any omission of any nature whatsoever that would cause any of the representations or warranties made in Article V of this Agreement to become untrue or incorrect in any material respect.

Seller and Purchaser agree that the Information will be used only for the purpose of completing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser agree to hold the Information in strictest confidence and shall not use, and shall not disclose directly or indirectly any of such Information except when, after and to the extent such Information (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than through the failure of Seller or Purchaser to fulfill its obligations hereunder, (ii) was already 

   #####

of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) _Delay._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Purchaser or Seller, if its Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, in the event that the Merger is not consummated by September 30, 2008, except to the extent that the failure of the Merger then to be consummated arises out of or results from the knowing action or inaction of the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01(c). 

  

 (d) _No Approval._ By Seller or Purchaser in the event (i) the approval of any Governmental Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied by final nonappealable action of such Governmental Authority or an application therefore shall have been permanently withdrawn at the invitation, request or suggestion of a Governmental Authority; (ii) the Seller shareholders fail to adopt this Agreement at the Seller Meeting and approve the Merger; or (iii) any of the closing conditions have not been met as required by Article VII hereof.
