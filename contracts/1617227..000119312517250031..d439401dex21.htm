accordance with the Restated Purchaser LLC Agreement, Parent shall cancel an equal number of shares of Parent Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, with such cancellations allocated among the applicable Seller in equal number to the number of Purchaser Units
transferred to Parent from such Seller. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><A NAME="ex2_1rom439401_115"></A>Section&nbsp;10.6&nbsp;<U>Treatment of Indemnification
