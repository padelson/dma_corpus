 Section 1.10 _Conversion of Company Membership Interest_.

(a) _Cancellation of Company Membership Interest_. As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Purchaser
Entities or the Sellers, all Company Membership Interest issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
cease to exist, and shall be automatically converted into and thereafter
represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and any
certificates for such Company Membership Interest shall be canceled and no
units or other equity interest of the Surviving Company shall be exchanged

(b) _Aggregate Merger Consideration_. Prior to adjustment pursuant to

Units issuable pursuant to the terms set forth herein by delivering to the
Sellers the Restated Purchaser LLC Agreement with an updated _Schedule I_
reflecting each Sellers ownership of such Purchaser Units.

(d) _Issuance of Parent Class_ __ _ B Common Stock_. In connection with the
payment of the Merger Consideration, and pursuant to the terms of the
Restated Purchaser LLC Agreement, at the Closing, as reflected in the Funds
Flow Statement, Parent shall issue to each Seller one share of Parent Class B
Common Stock for each Purchaser Unit issued to such Seller.

(e) _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Pre-Closing Parent Common Stock, units of membership
interest of Purchaser or Company Membership Interest shall have been changed
into a different number of shares, units or a different class of equity by
reason of any reclassification, share or unit split (including a reverse stock
or unit split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or units, readjustment or other similar transaction, or an equity dividend or
equity distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within that
period, other than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, then the
applicable Merger Consideration and/or the applicable Purchaser Unit Price
shall be equitably adjusted to provide the Sellers the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to that event (but no change will
be made because of the vesting of any Old LLC Units or New LLC Units of
Purchaser or exchange of such units for Parent Common Stock). For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.10(e)_ shall be deemed
to modify the Purchaser Entities obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.2_.

 

Section 1.11 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Closing Date Net Working Capital Calculation_.

 

(i) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall

Statement_ ") setting forth (A) a combined balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), and
(B) a calculation of the Net Working Capital Amount as of 11:59 p.m. on the
day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Net Working
Capital Amount_ "). The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the calculation of the
Reference Net Working Capital Amount as set forth on _Annex A_. The Sellers
and their accountants shall be entitled to review the Closing Statement, and
any working papers, trial balances and similar materials relating to the
Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Amount prepared by Purchaser or its accountants. Purchaser shall also provide
the Sellers and their accountants with reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to Purchasers relevant employees and outside accountants,
properties, books and records to the extent involved with or related to the
preparation of the Closing Statement.

(ii) If, within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Closing Statement,
the Sellers have not given Purchaser written notice of their objection to the
Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount (which notice shall state in
reasonable detail the basis of the Sellers objection), then Purchasers
calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount shall be binding
and conclusive on the parties for all purposes hereunder.

(iii) If the Sellers give Purchaser such notice of objection within the
thirty (30)-day period, and if the Sellers and Purchaser fail to resolve the
issues outstanding with respect to Purchasers calculation of the Closing Date
Net Working Capital Amount within thirty (30) days of Purchasers receipt of
an objection notice, the Sellers and Purchaser shall submit the issues
remaining in dispute to a nationally recognized certified public accounting
firm mutually selected by the Sellers and Purchaser (the " _Independent
Accountant_ "), for resolution in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
The review of the Independent Accountant shall be limited solely to the issues
remaining in dispute and not resolved by the Sellers and Purchaser pursuant
to the preceding

 



5  sentence. If issues remaining in dispute are submitted to the Independent
Accountant for resolution, (A) the Sellers and Purchaser shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to the Independent Accountant such work papers and
other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the
Independent Accountant may request and are available to that party or its
agents and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent
Accountant any material relating to the disputed issues and to discuss issues
with the Independent Accountant; (B) the determination by the Independent
Accountant, as set forth in a notice to be delivered to both Purchaser and
the Sellers within 30 days of the submission to the Independent Accountant of
the issues remaining in dispute, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties and shall be used in calculation of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Amount; and (C) the Sellers, on a several basis, and Purchaser will
each bear fifty percent (50%) of the fees and costs of the Independent
Accountant for such determination.

 

(iv) If the Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ exceeds the Reference Net Working
Capital Amount, Purchaser shall, issue to the Sellers (x) an amount of
additional Purchaser Units equal to the amount of such excess, divided by the
Purchaser Unit Price, with such additional Purchaser Units to be allocated
among the Sellers pro rata in accordance with the Funds Flow Statement and (y)
an equivalent number of shares of Parent Class B Common Stock as Purchaser
Units received by each Seller. If the Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount
as finally determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ is less than the
Reference Net Working Capital Amount, each Seller shall instruct Purchaser to
transfer to Parent such number of Purchaser Units received by such Seller
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.10_ above that is equal to such Sellers pro
rata portion of the total amount of such shortfall amount, divided by the
Purchaser Unit Price, and Purchaser shall thereafter reflect such transfer on
its books and records in accordance with the Restated Purchaser LLC Agreement.
All Purchaser Units owed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.11(iv)_ by
Purchaser to the Sellers, on the one hand, or by the Sellers to Purchaser, on
the other hand, are referred to as the " _Final Adjustment Amount_." Any
fractional Purchaser Unit that would otherwise be owed as payment of the Final
Adjustment Amount shall be paid in cash by the party obligated to make the
payment and shall be paid by delivery of immediately available funds to the
Purchaser, or to the Sellers, as applicable, within five (5) Business Days
after the date of final determination. If any Purchaser Units are transferred
to Parent pursuant to this paragraph, in accordance with the Restated
Purchaser LLC Agreement, Parent shall cancel an equal number of shares of
Parent Class B Common Stock, with any such cancellation reducing equally each
Sellers ownership of Parent Class B Common Stock.

(b) _Treatment for Tax Purposes_. Any payments made under this  _Section_ __
_ 1.11_ shall be treated by the Purchaser Entities and the Sellers as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for tax purposes, unless a final
determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor
form) with respect to such payment causes any such payment not to be treated
as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for tax purposes.

 

Section 1.12 _Dissenters  Rights_. Dissenters rights under Chapter 23 of
the TBCA are not available to the Parent Shareholders for the Transactions.

applicable Law, including the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including its rules and regulations, " _SOX_ "),
as the case may be, applicable to such Parent SEC Document, and none of the
Parent SEC Documents as of such respective dates or, if amended, as of the
date of such amendment, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under

schedules thereto) of Parent (the " _Parent SEC Financial Statements_ ")
included in the Parent SEC Documents (if amended, as of the date of the last 

 



26  such amendment) comply in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. The Parent SEC Financial Statements fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results

periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal recurring year-end audit adjustments, none of which, individually or in
the aggregate, has been or will be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, and to the absence of information or notes not required by
GAAP to be included in interim financial statements) in conformity with GAAP

applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes and schedules thereto).

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract, including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, on the
other hand, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or
effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
Parents or any of its Subsidiaries published financial statements or any
Parent SEC Documents.

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of Parent and the principal
financial officer of Parent (or each former principal executive officer of
Parent and each former principal financial officer of Parent, as applicable)
has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX, in each case, with respect to
the Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications
were complete, correct and accurate in all material respects on the date such
certifications were made. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in SOX.

(e) Parent has established and maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated
by the SEC under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
(i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that
transactions are executed only in accordance with the authorization of
management or Parents board of directors and (iii) regarding prevention or
timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Parents assets.

 

(f) Parent has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated by the SEC under the
Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed
to ensure that information (both financial and non-financial) relating to
Parent and the Subsidiaries of Parent required to be disclosed in Parents
periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is made known
to Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared. The
management of Parent has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of
Parents internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2017,
and no significant deficiency or material weakness was identified. To
Parents Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer from giving the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of SOX, without qualification,
when next due.

(g) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with (i) all applicable
rules and all current listing and corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ,
and (ii) all applicable rules, regulations and requirements of SOX and the
SEC.

obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any nature, whether

and warranties of the Purchaser Entities regarding Purchaser Benefits Plans

giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal or (2) such changes would not change the determination of
Parents board of directors of the need for a Recommendation Withdrawal in
response to such Intervening Event, as applicable. In the event of any
material revisions to such Superior Proposal or material changes related to
such Intervening Event, Parent shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to the Company and to comply with the requirements of this

or (B) any review or approval process.

(e) Subject to applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, each of
the Sellers and the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchaser Entities, on

cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with

recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (the Sellers, the Company or the
Purchaser Entities, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, materials provided to
the other party or its outside counsel may be redacted (1) to remove
references concerning valuation, (2) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, (3) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other
privilege or confidentiality concerns and (4) to remove references concerning
pricing and other competitively sensitive terms from an antitrust perspective
in the Contracts of the Sellers, the Company, Parent and their respective
Subsidiaries.

Section 6.6 _Company Employee Matters_.

(a) FNH and the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the employment
of the Business Employees to be transferred to the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries effective immediately prior to the Closing,

_Offered Employee_ ") under applicable Law or as a result of any Business
Employee having an existing employment agreement with FNH or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence for the transfer of employment of such
Business Employee to be effective upon the Closing, not less than five (5)
days prior to the Closing, the Company shall make an offer of employment to
each such Business Employee or cause the Company or its Subsidiaries
to assume the employment agreements set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_ for such transfer of employment to be
effective immediately prior to the Closing (each (i) Offered Employee (A)
who accepts the Companys offer of employment and commences employment with
the Company or another Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Closing or (B) whose employment agreement is set forth on  _Section_ __ _
6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ and is assumed by the Company or
another Subsidiary of the Company effective immediately prior to the Closing
and (ii) other Business Employee whose employment is transferred to the
Company immediately prior to the Closing, a " _Transferred Employee_ ").

(b) Subject and in addition to the requirements of any applicable Law
relating to employees acquired rights, the Companys offer of employment to
each Offered Employee shall be for, and the Company shall cause its
Subsidiaries to provide to each of the Transferred Employees immediately
prior to the Closing, the same (i) position, title, duties and other terms and
conditions of employment in effect for such Transferred Employee immediately
prior to their transfer to the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) base
salary or base wage rate in effect for such Transferred Employee immediately
prior to their transfer to the Company or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, all Transferred Employees shall be employees "at-will"
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and none of the Company,
nor any of its Subsidiaries, shall enter into any employment related
agreement between the date hereof and the Closing that will be binding on the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, following the
Closing, without Purchasers express written consent.

 

(c) FNH shall, at its own expense, give all notices and other information
required to be given by FNH to the Transferred Employees and any applicable
Governmental Entity and comply with any obligation to consult with or provide
benefits to any Business Employees under the WARN Act, the National Labor
Relations Act, the Code, COBRA and other applicable Laws in connection with
the execution of this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or the
consummation of the employment transfers and their impact on any Business
Employee.

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, express or implied, shall: (i)
confer upon any Business Employee, any right to continue in the employ or
service of Purchaser, FNH, the Company or any Affiliate thereof, or any right
to any particular term or condition of employment or service, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Purchaser, the Company,
FNH or any Affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any
Business Employee, at any time for any or no reason whatsoever, with or
without cause; (ii) be deemed to (1) establish, amend, modify or terminate
any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser,
the Company, FNH or any Affiliate thereof or any other benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement, policy, contract or arrangement, or (2) alter or
limit the ability of Purchaser, FNH, the Company or any Affiliate thereof, or
following the Closing, the Purchaser, Company or any of their Affiliates, to
amend, modify, or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan or employee
benefit plan maintained by Purchaser, the Company or any Affiliate thereof or
any other benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, policy, contract
or arrangement after the Closing; or (iii) be intended to or confer upon any
person, including any current or former employee, officer, director,
consultant or service provider of the Purchaser, the Company, FNH or any
Affiliate thereof (or any of their beneficiaries) any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever, including any third-party beneficiary rights, under
or by reason of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

 

Section 6.7 _Purchaser Entities Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) months following the Effective Time, the Purchaser
Entities shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to maintain for all
Transferred Employees, subject to their continued employment

 



52  during such period, base salaries and wage rates, as applicable, that are
substantially the same as received by such Transferred Employee as of the date
hereof. Following the Effective Time, the Purchaser Entities shall take
reasonable efforts to cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to establish and
make available to the Transferred Employees, subject to their continued
employment, health and welfare benefits that are commercially reasonable and
competitive for the employee marketplace in which the Restaurants compete.

(b) The Purchaser Entities shall use commercially reasonable efforts, subject
to the consent of the applicable insurer, to cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries to (i) credit each Transferred Employee with his or her years of
service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities
solely for purposes of eligibility and vesting (and not for the purpose of any
benefit accrual) to the same extent as such Transferred Employee was entitled
to credit immediately prior to the Effective Time for such service under any
substantially similar Company Benefit Plan, (ii) waive any applicable pre-
existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or successor
welfare benefit plan of the Purchaser Entities or any of its Subsidiaries that
a Transferred Employee is eligible to participate in following the Effective
Time to the extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to,
or had been satisfied by, such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such
Transferred Employee participated, and (iii) provide each Transferred
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the
portion of the applicable plan year prior to the Effective Time (to the same
extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior
to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out of
pocket requirements.

(c) Nothing in  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, express or
implied, shall: (i) confer upon any Business Employee, any right to continue
in the employ or service of Purchaser, FNH, the Company or any
Affiliate thereof, or any right to any particular term or condition of
employment or service, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Purchaser, the Company, FNH or any Affiliate thereof to discharge or
terminate the services of any Business Employee, at any time for any or no
reason whatsoever, with or without cause; (ii) be deemed to (1) establish,
amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan
maintained by Purchaser, the Company, FNH or any Affiliate thereof or any
other benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, policy, contract or
arrangement, or (2) alter or limit the ability of Purchaser, FNH, the Company
or any Affiliate thereof, or following the Closing, the Purchaser, Company or
any of their Affiliates, to amend, modify, or terminate any particular Company
Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser, the Company or
any Affiliate thereof or any other benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, policy, contract or arrangement after the Closing; or (iii) be
intended to or confer upon any person, including any current or former
employee, officer, director, consultant, service provider of the Purchaser,
the Company, FNH or any Affiliate thereof (or any of their beneficiaries) any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any third-party
beneficiary rights, under or by reason of _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ and  _Section_
__ _ 6.7_.

TAX MATTERS

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between Purchaser and the Sellers for certain tax matters following the
Closing Date:

 

Section 7.1 _Tax Returns_. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods which are required to be filed
after the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance
with past practice. Purchaser shall submit such Tax Returns to the Sellers
for their review and approval no later than twenty (20) days prior to the due
date for filing thereof (except where such 20-day period is not practical, in
which case as soon as practical). Purchaser shall make such revisions to such
Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Sellers. The Sellers shall
reimburse Purchaser for the amount of any Pre-Closing Taxes shown as due on
any Tax Return filed pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ within fifteen (15) days
after payment by Purchaser or the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent
such Taxes (A) are not reflected in the reserve for Tax Liability (rather
than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and (B) have not been taken into account in the Final Adjustment
Amount.

 

Section 7.2 _Straddle Periods_. In the case of any Straddle Period, the
amount of Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to
be: (i) in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic (such as
certain franchise Taxes, or ad valorem, real or personal property Taxes), the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Tax period ending on
and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of calendar days in the entire Tax period and (ii) in the case of any Tax not
described in (i) above (such as Taxes based upon or related to income or
receipts) the amount of such Taxes that would be payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period
shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 7.3 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation or
other Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records
and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation
or other Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. The Company and the Sellers agree (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Business, the Company
or its

 



55  Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or
the Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority, and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other party so requests, Company or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall
allow the other party to take possession of such books and records.

 

(b) Purchaser and the Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental
authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the Transactions).

 

Section 7.4 _Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any Tax refunds that are received by
Purchaser or the Company, and any amounts credited against Tax to which
Purchaser or the Company become entitled, that relate to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods shall be for the account of the Sellers, and Purchaser shall pay over
to the Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such credit within
fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto, net of any reasonable
costs or Expenses incurred by Purchaser or the Company in securing such refund
or credit in each case to the extent the amount of such refund or credit was
not taken into account in determining the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Amount. In addition, to the extent that a claim for refund or a Proceeding
results in a payment or credit against Tax by a Taxing Authority to Purchaser
or Surviving Company of any amount, Purchaser shall pay such amount to the
Sellers within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

principally caused by such partys breach of any material provisions of this
Agreement, such partys failure to act in good faith or such partys failure
to perform fully its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.5_.

respective Subsidiaries or their respective former, current or future

INDEMNIFICATION

 Section 10.1 _Survival_. (i) Any obligation of a party to indemnify any
other party (A) under _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _
10.2(b)(i)_, respectively, in respect of any breach of any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in _Article II_ , any representation or
warranty of the Sellers set forth in _Article III_ or any representation or
warranty of the Purchaser Entities set forth in _Article IV_ or (B) under
_Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.2(b)(ii)_, respectively, in
respect of any breach of any covenant or agreement required by its terms to be
performed or complied with prior to the Closing, shall survive the Closing
until the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date; and (ii)
any obligation of the Sellers to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(iii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(iv)_ shall
survive the Closing until the date that is thirty (30) days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. All of the covenants
contained in this Agreement that by their nature are required to be performed
after the Closing shall survive the Closing until fully performed or
fulfilled, unless and to the extent only that non-compliance with such
covenants or agreements is waived in writing by the party entitled to such
performance. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, any breach or
inaccuracy of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty in respect
of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement, and the obligation of a
party to indemnify any other party in respect thereof, shall survive the time
at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding two
sentences, if written notice in accordance with the requirements set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_ of the breach or inaccuracy thereof giving rise to such
right of indemnity shall have been given to the party against whom such
indemnity may be sought prior to such time. The parties acknowledge and agree
that with respect to any claim that any party may have against any other party
that is permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the survival
periods set forth and agreed to in this _Section_ __ _  10.1_ shall govern
when any such claim may be brought.

Section 10.2 _Indemnification_. 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article X_ , from and after the
Closing, the Sellers shall, on a several basis (and not on a joint and
several basis) to the extent of each such Sellers Pro Rata Share, indemnify
Parent,

 



61  Purchaser and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
successors, permitted assigns, agents and representatives (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") against and agree to hold each of them harmless
from any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee
arising out of or relating to:

 

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the
Company set forth in _Article II_ or of the Sellers set forth in  _Article
III_ ;

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by the
Sellers, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement;

(iii) any and all Taxes (or the nonpayment thereof) of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or otherwise related to the Business, for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (including, as allocated, with respect to a Straddle Period, in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.2_) (" _Pre-Closing Taxes_"); and

(iv) any amount for which Parent is responsible under the Tax
Matters Agreement or the Separation and Distribution Agreement arising as a
result of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

 

provided that (A) the Sellers shall not be liable for any claim for
indemnification (x) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(i)_ or  _(ii)_
unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by Purchaser
Indemnitees which may be recovered from the Sellers under such subsections in
the aggregate exceeds the Deductible, after which only the amount of such
Losses incurred which are in excess of the Deductible shall be recoverable
hereunder and (y) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ for any and all Taxes (or
the nonpayment thereof) of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise
related to the Business, for any taxable period, or portion thereof,
beginning after the Closing Date, and (B) in no event shall the Sellers
aggregate Liability arising out of or relating to any claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Sections 10.2(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ exceed
$19,900,000 (the " _Seller Cap_ ").

(b) Subject to the provisions of this  _Article X_ , from and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify the Sellers and their Affiliates (other
than Parent, or its Subsidiaries, including the Company), directors, officers,
employees, successors, permitted assigns, agents and Representatives
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") against and agrees to hold each
of them harmless from any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller
Indemnitee arising out of or relating to:

 

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser Entities set forth in _Article IV_ ; and

 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by
Parent, Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement;

provided that (A) Purchaser shall not be liable for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(b)_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of Losses incurred by Seller Indemnitees which may be
recovered from Purchaser exceeds the Deductible, after which only the amount
of such Losses incurred which are in excess of the Deductible shall
be recoverable hereunder, and (B) in no event shall Purchasers aggregate
Liability arising out of or relating to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(b)_ exceed
$19,900,000 (the " _Purchaser Cap_ ").

 

(c) For purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred and for
computing the dollar amount of any claim for indemnification resulting from a
breach of any representation or warranty herein, all materiality, material
adverse effect and similar qualifications shall be disregarded.

 

Section 10.3 _Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) Any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming indemnification
under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any claim
asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party (" _Third_

 



62   _Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification hereunder shall promptly notify in writing (such notice, a "
_Claim Notice_ ") the Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ " or " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") of the Third Party Claim
within thirty (30) days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written
notice of the Third Party Claim, which Claim Notice shall describe in
reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, including the basis of
the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement and
the amount of the Losses arising or in good faith estimated to arise
therefrom (if available); _provided_ , that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.1_,
failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the
Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay or omission.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim at any time and, subject to the limitations
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_, assume and control the defense
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume and control the defense of the Third Party
Claim at any time and the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing that such
Third Party Claim is an indemnifiable Loss under this _Article X_ , then the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party in all appropriate Proceedings, to
a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_. The Indemnifying Party shall
have full control of such defense and Proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; provided, however, that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume or control such defense and Proceedings if such
Third Party Claim seeks equitable or other non-monetary relief (including any
sanction or restriction upon the conduct or operation of any business of the
Indemnified Party) or if the Third Party Claim alleges conduct that would
constitute criminal activity, the Third Party Claim relates to Taxes, or if
the resolution of such Third Party Claim in a manner adverse to the
Indemnified Party could result in Losses to the Indemnified Party in excess of
the amount claimed or expected to be received from the Indemnifying Party, and
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement agreement
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement
contains a complete and unconditional general release by the third party
asserting the claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim and (ii)
the settlement agreement does not contain any admission by, or sanction
or restriction upon the conduct or operation of any business by, the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, including any injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_, and the Indemnified Party shall
bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation unless (i)
the employment of separate legal counsel has been specifically authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) there exists a material conflict of
interest, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party fails to pursue the defense of such
Third Party Claim actively and diligently, in the case of _clause (ii)_ or
_(iii)_ , whereupon the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain the
defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party has elected to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_ within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of any
Claim Notice or is not otherwise entitled to defend such Third Party Claim,
then subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_ the Indemnified Party shall defend,
and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard
to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, in
all appropriate Proceedings, which Proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently
by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of
such defense and Proceedings; _provided_ , however, that the Indemnified
Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party
Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying
Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall
bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.

 



63 (d) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party
Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including providing
access to documents, records and information. In addition, the Indemnified
Party will make its personnel available at no cost to the Indemnifying Party
for conferences, discovery, Proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may be
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party also agrees
to reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the
making of any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third
Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person and executing powers of
attorney to the extent necessary unless doing so would materially impair the
conduct of the business conducted by the Indemnified Party.

 

(e) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim shall be asserted by notice to the Indemnifying Party, which notice
shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, the basis of the
Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement and the
amount of the Losses arising or in good faith estimated to arise therefrom (to
the extent reasonably estimable). Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, failure
to timely provide such notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified
Partys indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such delay or omission.

Section 10.4 _Calculation of Losses_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein:

(a) no Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to
indemnification to the extent a Liability or reserve relating to the matter
giving rise to such Losses has been included in the final determination of the
Final Adjustment Amount;

 

(b) each Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, take reasonably prudent steps consistent with customary business
practices to mitigate any Losses arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby after becoming actually aware of the
incurrence of such Losses;

 

(c) the amount of any Loss for which an Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement: (i) shall be reduced by any insurance
proceeds actually received from third party insurers with respect to such
Loss; (ii) shall be reduced by any reduction in Taxes actually paid (or any
increase in any Tax refund actually received) by the Indemnified Party as a
result of the incurrence or payment of such Loss in the taxable year of the
incurrence or payment of such Loss, or in any prior taxable year; and (iii)
shall be reduced by indemnification or reimbursement payments actually
received from third parties with respect to such Loss, net, in the case of
each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, of any reasonable costs associated with
the recovery of such amounts. In the event any Indemnified Party actually
recovers any insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or any third-party
recoveries in respect of any Losses, in each case at any time subsequent to
any indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article X_ , such Indemnified
Party shall thereafter promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
indemnity payment made up to the amount actually received by the Indemnified
Party (net of any costs, fees or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount); and

 

(d) except with respect to those actually awarded and paid on account of a
Third Party Claim, and identified as such in connection with such award, no
party shall be liable for punitive, exemplary, speculative or remote damages,
or any damages based on any multiple of earnings or revenue or loss of
profits, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Law or
otherwise and whether or not arising from any other partys sole, joint or
concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault.

 Section 10.5 _Payment of Losses_. In the event any Purchaser Indemnitee or
Seller Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the applicable
Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties shall pay or cause to be paid to
the Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, an amount in
Purchaser Units and corresponding shares of Parent Class B Common Stock equal
to the indemnifiable Losses, subject to the limitations set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 10.2_; _provided_ , _that_ , in the case of the Sellers, each
Seller shall pay only its Pro

 



64  Rata Share. The date of final determination of Losses shall be the date on
which such Losses are agreed by the applicable Indemnifying Party, or the date
of a final, nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction or other
arbitrator or arbitral body. The number of Purchaser Units and shares of
Parent Class B Common Stock to be paid in connection with the indemnification
hereunder shall be equal to the amount of the applicable Losses divided by
the Parent Class A Per Share Price (rounded down to the nearest whole share).
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Parent Class_ __ _ A Per Share
Price_" shall mean the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading
prices of Parent Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (as
reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually selected by the parties) on each of the ten
(10) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading day that
is two (2) trading days prior to the date of the final determination of the
Losses. If any Seller does not comply with its obligations pursuant to the
foregoing within such five (5) Business Day period, Purchaser shall be
entitled to, without further action of any party, irrevocably cause the
transfer of an amount of Purchaser Units held of record by such Seller to
Parent that is equal to such Sellers Pro Rata Share of the amount of such
Losses incurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_, divided by the Parent
Class A Per Share Price (rounded down to the nearest whole share), and
Purchaser shall thereafter reflect such transfer on its books and records in
accordance with the Restated Purchaser LLC Agreement. Upon delivery of a Claim
Notice or other notice of indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ by
a Purchaser Indemnitee, Purchaser shall be entitled to place a stop transfer
order with respect to, and until final determination of such indemnification
claim shall not permit the transfer of, an amount of Purchaser Units
(calculated in accordance with the preceding sentence) held of record by the
applicable Seller or Sellers that would be sufficient to satisfy the
indemnification obligation of such Seller or Sellers as set forth in such
Claim Notice or other notice of indemnification, assuming a final
determination of indemnification in favor of the Purchaser Indemnitee in the
amount of Losses set forth in such Claim Notice or other notice of
indemnification. If any Purchaser Units are transferred to Parent pursuant to
this paragraph, in accordance with the Restated Purchaser LLC Agreement,
Parent shall cancel an equal number of shares of Parent Class B Common Stock,
with such cancellations allocated among the applicable Seller in equal number
to the number of Purchaser Units transferred to Parent from such Seller.

Section 10.6 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any payment made
pursuant to the indemnification obligations arising under this _Article X_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration to the extent
allowable under applicable Law, including for Tax purposes. 

Section 10.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, except (i) with respect to the matters covered by _Section_
__ _ 1.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, (ii) in the case where a party seeks to
obtain specific performance pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.10(c)_ or (iii)
for claims of fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation, the
parties hereby agree that following the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy
of a party for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement shall be the applicable
indemnification rights set forth in this _Article X_.
