-iv- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION, dated as of January 21,
2014 (this " _Agreement_ "), is entered into by and between TriCo Bancshares,
a California corporation (" _TriCo_ "), and North Valley Bancorp, a California
corporation (" _North Valley_ ").

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of TriCo and North Valley have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies
and shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided
for herein in which North Valley will, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, merge with and into TriCo, with TriCo being the surviving
corporation in such merger (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to the terms of the
agreement of merger (the " _Agreement of Merger_ ") substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A.

 

WHEREAS, immediately upon consummation of the Merger, TriCo intends to cause
Tri Counties Bank, a California-chartered bank and wholly owned subsidiary of
TriCo (" _Tri Counties Bank_ "), and North Valley Bank, a California-chartered
bank and wholly owned subsidiary of North Valley (" _North Valley Bank_ "), to
consummate a merger (the " _Bank Merger_ ") pursuant to the terms of a merger
agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the " _Bank
Merger Agreement_ "), whereby North Valley Bank will merge with and into Tri
Counties Bank with Tri Counties Bank being the surviving corporation in the
Bank Merger (the " _Surviving Bank_ ").

WHEREAS, the Merger and the Bank Merger are each intended to be treated as a
" _reorganization_ " within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of TriCo to enter into this Agreement, each of
the North Valley directors is executing and delivering to TriCo a shareholder
agreement (each, a " _Shareholder Agreement_ "), in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit C-1 and a non-solicitation agreement in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit D (the " _Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality Agreement_ "), to be
effective as of the Effective Time.

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of North Valley to enter into this Agreement,
each of the TriCo directors is executing and delivering to North Valley a
Shareholder Agreement in the form attached hereto as of Exhibit C-2.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows.

 



1 ARTICLE I.

 

 _THE MERGER_

1.1.  _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, North Valley shall merge with and into TriCo, with TriCo
being the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger,
the corporate existence of North Valley shall cease and the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to exist as a California corporation.

 

1.2. _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective on the Closing Date
(as defined in Section 9.1 hereof), as set forth in the Agreement of Merger
in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto, which shall be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of California on the Closing Date. The "
_Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time the Agreement of Merger is so
filed.

1.3. _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 1107 of the California
Corporations Code (the " _CGCL_ ").

1.4. _Conversion of North Valley Common Stock_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any shares of North Valley common stock (the "
_North Valley Common Stock_ "), each share of North Valley Common Stock that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
the associated preferred stock purchase rights (the " _North Valley Rights_
") issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Shareholder Protection Rights
Agreement dated as of March 26, 2009, as amended, between North Valley and
Mellon Investor Services LLC (the " _North Valley Rights Agreement_ "), will
be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of TriCo common
stock (" _TriCo Common Stock_ ") equal to the Stock Exchange Ratio (as defined
below) (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Stock Exchange Ratio_ " means 0.9433 shares of TriCo Common Stock for each
one (1) share of North Valley Common Stock.

 

(b) All of the shares of North Valley Common Stock converted pursuant to this
Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any
such shares of North Valley Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall
thereafter represent the right to receive (i) the number of whole shares of
TriCo Common Stock and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the
shares of North Valley Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement. Certificates previously
representing shares of North Valley Common Stock shall be exchanged for
certificates representing whole shares of TriCo Common Stock and cash in lieu
of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of
such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof, without any interest
thereon. If after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, TriCo
should split or combine its common stock, or declare a stock dividend with a
distribution or record date, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time, or
effect a reclassification, recapitalization or similar transaction, then the
Stock Exchange Ratio, and the number of shares of TriCo Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to Section 1.4(a) of this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such split, combination, stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

 



2 (c) At the Effective Time, all shares of North Valley Common Stock that are
owned by North Valley as treasury stock, if any, and all shares of North
Valley Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by North Valley or
any Subsidiary of North Valley except those (i) held in a fiduciary capacity
or (ii) held as a result of debts previously contracted in good faith, shall
be canceled and shall cease to exist and no TriCo Common Stock or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Subsidiary_ " shall have the meaning given that term in Item
210.1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ").

 

(d) Certificates for fractions of shares of TriCo Common Stock will not be
issued. In lieu of a fraction of a share of TriCo Common Stock, each holder
of North Valley Common Stock entitled to a fraction of a share of TriCo Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled to receive an amount of
cash equal to such fraction of a share of TriCo Common Stock multiplied by the
weighted average of the closing prices for shares of TriCo Common Stock as
quoted on NASDAQ for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. Following consummation of
the Merger, no holder of North Valley Common Stock shall be entitled to
dividends or any other rights in respect of any such fraction.

1.5. _TriCo Common Stock_. Each share of TriCo Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unchanged and
shall remain issued and outstanding as common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

1.6. _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
North Valley Common Stock (a " _North Valley Option_ ") granted by North
Valley pursuant to the North Valley Bancorp 1998 Employee Stock Incentive
Plan, the North Valley Bancorp 1999 Director Stock Option Plan, and the North
Valley Bancorp 2008 Incentive Plan, each such Plan governed by the laws of
the state of California (collectively, the " _North Valley Option Plans_ "),
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be treated in accordance with Section 6.16.

 

1.7. _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of TriCo, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

1.8. _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of TriCo, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.9. _Directors and Officers_. Subject to Section 6.15, at the Effective
Time, the directors and officers of TriCo immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall continue to be directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.10. _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger, either alone or in
conjunction with the Bank Merger, and the Bank Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of the
Code.

 



3 1.11. _Accounting Treatment_. It is intended that the Merger shall be
accounted for as a "purchase" under accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (" _GAAP_ ").

ARTICLE II.

_EXCHANGE OF SHARES_

 

2.1. _TriCo to Make Cash and Shares Available_. Prior to the Effective Time,
TriCo shall appoint TriCos transfer agent, Computershare, or such other
similarly-qualified bank, trust company or transfer agent as TriCo may select
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and provide the Exchange Agent with appropriate
instructions regarding the matters described in this Article II, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to TriCo and North Valley, all in accordance
with the provisions of an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ")
executed between TriCo and the Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective
Time, TriCo shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the shares of TriCo
Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares (such certificates and
cash for shares of TriCo Common Stock, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ") to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant
to Section 2.2(a) hereof in exchange for outstanding shares of North Valley
Common Stock. All fees, expenses and cost reimbursements payable to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to the Exchange Agent Agreement shall be for the
account of TriCo.

 

2.2. _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable but not later than five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time, TriCo shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form letter of transmittal, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to TriCo and North Valley, (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) plus instructions for use of the letter of transmittal in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing the shares of TriCo Common Stock and the cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which the shares of North Valley Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
promptly in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number
of whole shares of TriCo Common Stock to which such holder of North Valley
Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions hereof and
(y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share, if
any, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, which certificate
for shares of TriCo Common Stock and check representing cash in lieu of
fractional shares shall be mailed to each such holder not later than ten (10)
days following receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate or
Certificates and a duly executed letter of transmittal, and the Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares, unpaid dividends,
and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.

 



4 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to TriCo Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder
thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
After the surrender of a Certificate or Certificates in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of TriCo Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.

(c) If any certificate representing shares of TriCo Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes or applicable fees
required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of
TriCo Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers entered on the stock
transfer books of North Valley or otherwise of the shares of North Valley
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of TriCo Common
Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in this Article II.

 

(e) Each of TriCo and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable from the Exchange Fund pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of North Valley Common Stock, such amounts as the
Exchange Agent or TriCo, as the case may be, is required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law,
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so
withheld by TriCo or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of shares of North Valley Common Stock in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made by TriCo or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

 

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by TriCo, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as TriCo may reasonably direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate at such persons expense and such persons payment of any
related fees of the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of TriCo Common
Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



5 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of North Valley for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to TriCo. Any shareholders of North Valley who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to TriCo
or TriCos designated representative for payment of their shares of TriCo
Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and
distributions on TriCo Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of
North Valley Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of TriCo, North Valley, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of North Valley Common
Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

the laws of the State of California. North Valley and its Subsidiaries have
the corporate and other power and authority to own or lease all of their
properties and assets and to carry on their business as it is now being
conducted and are duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of any material business conducted by them
or the character or location of any material properties or assets owned or
leased by them makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined below) on North Valley. North Valley is duly registered as
a bank holding company with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ "). North Valley Bank, North Valley
Trading Company, which is inactive, North Valley Capital Trust II, North

validly existing under the laws of California. The deposit accounts of North
Valley Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "
_FDIC_ ") to the fullest extent permitted by Law (as defined in Section 3.3),

been paid by North Valley Bank. As of the date hereof, North Valley Bank is
"well-capitalized" (as that term is defined at 12 C.F.R. Section 325.103).
North Valley Bank has the corporate and other power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of any material business conducted by it or
the character or location of any material properties or assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on North Valley. Neither North Valley Bank, North Valley nor any
Subsidiary of North Valley engages in the trust business or serves as a
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment advisor for any fiduciary accounts. Section 3.1(b) of the North

other material actions taken by the shareholders, their respective Boards of
Directors and all standing committees of their respective Boards of Directors.

 

(d) The term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " with respect to TriCo or North
Valley, as the case may be, means a condition, event, change or occurrence
that has had or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect upon
the financial condition, results of operations or business of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or materially impairs the ability of such
party to perform its obligations under, or to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that in determining
whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred there shall be excluded any
effect on the referenced party the cause of which is (i) any change in
banking or similar laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or
interpretations thereof by courts or governmental authorities, (ii) any change
in GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements applicable to banks or their
holding companies generally, (iii) any action or omission of TriCo, North
Valley or any Subsidiary of either of them taken with the prior written
consent of TriCo or North Valley, as applicable, or as otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) any changes in general economic, market
or political conditions affecting banks or their holding companies generally,
(v) the impact of the announcement of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (vi) changes in national or international political or
social conditions including the engagement by the United States in hostilities
whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency or war, or
the occurrence of any military or terrorist attack upon or within the United
States, or any of its territories, possessions or diplomatic or consular
offices or upon any military installation, equipment or personnel of
the United States, unless it uniquely affects either or both of the parties,
provided that the effect of such changes described in clauses (iv), and (vi)
hereof shall not be excluded to the extent of any materially disproportionate
impact (if any) they have on such party.

 



7 3.2. _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of North Valley consists of 60,000,000 shares
of North Valley Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with no
par value (the " _North Valley Preferred Stock_ "). As of the date hereof,
there are: (i) 6,836,463 shares of North Valley Common Stock issued and
outstanding, including 47,740 shares held by the North Valley Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (the " _North Valley ESOP_ "); (ii) no shares of North Valley

Valley Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock
options or otherwise, except for 378,365 shares of North Valley Common Stock

collectively, options to purchase 354,710 shares are outstanding at the date
hereof). No shares of North Valley Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding
or reserved for issuance, except for 125,000 shares of North Valley Preferred
Stock designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock reserved
for issuance pursuant to the North Valley Rights Agreement, none of which is
issued and outstanding as of the date hereof. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of North Valley Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.

(b) All of the outstanding stock options granted by North Valley have been
granted in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the
applicable North Valley Option Plan and all applicable Laws. Except for the
outstanding options, plans and other obligations set forth above, North Valley
does not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
purchase or issuance of any shares of North Valley Common Stock, North Valley
Preferred Stock or any other equity security of North Valley or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of North Valley Common Stock, North Valley Preferred Stock or any other equity
security of North Valley. With respect to each option outstanding as of
the date hereof, the name of each optionee, the date of each option to
purchase North Valley Common Stock granted, the number of shares subject to
each such option and the price at which each such option may be exercised are
set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the North Valley Disclosure Letter and no such
option expires more than ten (10) years from the date of the grant thereof.
The exercise price of each North Valley Option is no less than the fair market
value of a share of common stock of North Valley Bancorp determined on the
date of grant of such stock option (and as of any later modification thereof
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code). Each North Valley Option
intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the
Code has been structured to so qualify. Each grant of a North Valley Option
was duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such North
Valley Option was by its terms to be effective by all necessary corporate
action, including, as applicable, approval by the board of directors of North
Valley (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof), or a duly
authorized delegate thereof, and any required shareholder approval by the
necessary number of votes or written consents, and the award agreement
governing such grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by each party
thereto no later than the date of grant. North Valley has not granted,
and there is no and has been no North Valley policy or practice to grant, any
North Valley Options prior to, or otherwise coordinated the grant of North
Valley Options with, the release or other public announcement of material
information regarding North Valley or its financial results or prospects. The
treatment of the North Valley Options provided for under this Agreement,
including but not limited to Section 6.16 hereof, is consistent in all
material respects with and not in violation of any document or agreement
pertaining to a North Valley Option or a North Valley Option Plan or any
applicable Laws.

 



8 (c) Neither North Valley nor any of its Subsidiaries have any authorized,
issued, or outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness for
which the holders thereof have the right to vote on any matters on which the
shareholders have the right to vote. Other than the North Valley Rights
Agreement, there are no registration rights, and there is no voting trust,
proxy, rights agreement, "poison pill" anti-takeover plan or other agreement
or understanding to which North Valley is a party or by which it is bound with
respect to any equity security of any class of North Valley or with respect
to any equity security, partnership interest or similar ownership interest of
any class of any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) North Valley owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of its Subsidiaries, free and clear
of all liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever, and
all of such shares are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No North Valley Subsidiary has or
is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of its capital stock or any other equity security or
any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security.

or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and neither North Valley
nor any of its Subsidiaries has contributed to, or had any obligation to
contribute to, any such employee pension benefit plan in the previous seven

16 (e) Each North Valley Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
that considers the law changes incorporated in the plan sponsors most
recently expired remedial amendment cycle determined under the provisions of
Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2007-44, and to the Knowledge of
North Valley, nothing has occurred since the date of such letter that is
reasonably likely to adversely affect the tax qualification of such plan or to
require action under the compliance resolution programs of the Internal
Revenue Service to preserve such qualification.

(f) To the Knowledge of North Valley, each North Valley Plan, both with
respect to its form and administration, has been maintained, funded and
administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms, the
provisions of ERISA, the Code and applicable Law, whether as a matter of

is there any reasonable basis for any such lawsuit, investigation or claim.

 

(j) Neither North Valley nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability under
any North Valley Plan arising out of the treatment of any service provider as
an independent contractor or other self-employed individual rather than as an
employee, or vice-versa. Except as set forth in Section 3.11(j) of the North
Valley Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, either alone or in combination with any other
event, (i) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount
of or otherwise enhance any benefit due any employee, officer, director,
independent contractor or consultant of North Valley or any of its
Subsidiaries under any North Valley Plan; or (ii) accelerate or require the
funding (whether on a formal or informal basis) of the benefits under any
North Valley Plan.

 

(k) Each North Valley Plan which constitutes in any part a nonqualified
deferred compensation arrangement within the meaning of and subject
to Section 409A of the Code has at all times complied, both in form and
operation, with the requirements of Section 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the
Code and applicable regulations and other guidance thereunder.

 



17 (l) None of the North Valley Plans provides any benefits that would result in
excess parachute payments (within the meaning of Section 280G) of the Code,
either (i) solely as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; or (ii) as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and any actions taken by TriCo after the

(n) Each of the North Valley Plans is maintained in the United States and is
subject only to the Laws of the United States or a political subdivision
thereof.

(o) No action taken pursuant to Section 6.16 hereof will violate the terms of
the North Valley Option Plans or of any award agreement entered into pursuant
to such plans, nor will any such action constitute a material violation of any
applicable Laws.

 

(p) Neither North Valley nor any of its Subsidiaries has undertaken to
maintain any North Valley Plan for any period of time, and each North Valley
Plan is terminable at the sole discretion of the sponsor thereof, subject only
to such constraints as may be imposed by applicable Laws, including Section
409A of the Code, or as may be imposed by the written terms of the plan
document of the North Valley Plan.

3.12. _Certain Contracts_.

Section 3.12 is referred to herein as a " _North Valley Contract_."

(c) (i) Each North Valley Contract is a valid and binding commitment of North

and effect; (ii) each of North Valley and its Subsidiaries has in all material
respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date
under each North Valley Contract; (iii) no event or condition exists which
constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute, a

North Valley Contract by any other party thereto. True, correct and complete

desist or other order issued by, or is a party to any written agreement,
consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any
commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or
directive by, or has been a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter
from, or has adopted any board resolutions (each of the foregoing, a "
_Regulatory Agreement_ "), at the request of any Governmental Entity that
restricts the conduct of its business or that in any manner relates to its
capital adequacy, its credit policies, its management or its business, nor has
North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries been advised by any Governmental
Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any Regulatory Agreement.

3.14. _State Takeover Laws; Rights Agreement_.

(a) North Valley and its Board of Directors have taken, or by the Effective
Time will have taken, all necessary action so that any applicable provisions
of the takeover laws of California and any other state (and any comparable
provisions of North Valleys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws) do not and
will not apply to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

(b) North Valley has (i) duly authorized and executed an
appropriate amendment to the North Valley Rights Agreement, which amendment
has been provided to TriCo and (ii) taken all other action necessary or
appropriate so that the entering into of this Agreement or the Shareholder
Agreements, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (including the Merger) do not and will not result in TriCo being or
becoming an "Acquiring Person" thereunder or the ability of any person to
exercise a "Right" (as defined in the North Valley Rights Agreement) or
enabling or requiring Rights to separate from the shares of North Valley
Common Stock to which they are attached or to be triggered or become
exercisable. The North Valley Rights Agreement will expire immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and the North Valley Rights Agreement, as so amended,
has not been further amended or modified except in accordance herewith. No
"Distribution Date," "Shares Acquisition Date" or "Trigger Event" (as such
terms are defined in the North Valley Rights Agreement) has occurred prior to
the date of this Agreement, nor will occur as a result of the entry by North
Valley into this Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



19 3.15. _Environmental Matters_. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or
other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental
investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any
nature seeking to impose, or that reasonably could be expected to result in
the imposition, on North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability
or obligation arising under common law standards relating to environmental
protection, human health or safety, or under any local, state or federal
environmental statute, regulation or ordinance, including, without
limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended (collectively, the " _Environmental Laws_
"), pending or, to the Knowledge of North Valley, threatened against North
Valley or any of its Subsidiaries, which liability or obligation would have or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on North
Valley. There is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or
governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that
would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on North Valley. To the Knowledge of North Valley, during or prior to the
period of (i) its or any of its Subsidiaries ownership or operation of any
of their respective current properties, (ii) its or any of its Subsidiaries
participation in the management of any property, or (iii) its or any of its
Subsidiaries holding of a security interest in any property, there were no
releases or threatened releases of hazardous, toxic, radioactive or dangerous
materials or other materials regulated under Environmental Laws in, on, under
or affecting any such property which would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on North Valley. Neither North Valley nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or
memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or
third party imposing any material liability or obligation pursuant to or under
any Environmental Law that would have or would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on North Valley.

 

3.16. _Allowances for Losses_. All allowances for loan and lease losses of
North Valley and its Subsidiaries, including any reserves for unfunded
commitments, are, and as of the Effective Time will be, made in compliance
with all applicable Laws, North Valleys methodology for determining the
adequacy of its allowance for losses and the standards established by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board. Neither North Valley nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been notified by any Governmental Entity or by North Valleys
independent auditor, in writing or otherwise, that: (i) such allowances are
inadequate; (ii) the practices and policies of North Valley or any of its
Subsidiaries in establishing such allowances and in accounting for non-
performing and classified assets generally fail to comply with applicable
accounting or regulatory requirements; or (iii) such allowances are
inadequate or inconsistent with the historical loss experience of North Valley
or any of its Subsidiaries. Section 3.16 of the North Valley Disclosure Letter
sets forth a complete list of all extensions of nonaccrual, credit and other
real estate owned (" _OREO_ ") that as of December 31, 2013 were classified as
special mention, substandard, doubtful, loss or words of similar import. All
OREO, if any, held by North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries is being
carried at fair value in accordance with GAAP.

 



20 3.17. _Properties and Assets_. Section 3.17 of the North Valley
Disclosure Letter lists as of the date of this Agreement: (i) all real
property owned by North Valley and its Subsidiaries; (ii) each real property
lease, sublease or installment purchase arrangement to which North Valley or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party; (iii) a description of each contract for
the purchase, sale, or development of real estate to which North Valley or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party; and (iv) each item of North Valleys or any of
its Subsidiaries tangible personal property and equipment with a net book
value of $40,000 or more or having any annual lease payment of $25,000 or
more. Except for (a) items reflected in North Valleys consolidated financial
statements as of September 30, 2013 referred to in Section 3.6 hereof, (b)
exceptions to title that do not interfere materially with North Valleys or
any of its Subsidiaries use and enjoyment of owned real property (other than
OREO), (c) liens for current real estate taxes not yet delinquent, or being
contested in good faith, properly reserved against, (d) properties and assets
sold or transferred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices since December 31, 2012, and (e) items listed in Section 3.17 of
the North Valley Disclosure Letter, North Valley and its Subsidiaries have
good and, as to owned real property, marketable and insurable title to all
their owned real and tangible personal property, free and clear of all
material liens, claims, charges and other encumbrances. North Valley and its
Subsidiaries, as lessees, have the right under valid and existing leases to
occupy, use and possess all property leased by them. All real property and
fixed assets used by North Valley and its Subsidiaries are in good operating
condition and repair (subject to ordinary wear and tear) suitable for the
purposes for which they are currently utilized, and, to the Knowledge of
North Valley, comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws
relating thereto now in effect. North Valley and its Subsidiaries enjoy
peaceful and undisturbed possession under all leases for the use of all
property under which they are the lessees, and all leases to which North
Valley or any of its Subsidiaries is a party are valid and binding obligations
of North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms
thereof. Neither North Valley nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material
default with respect to any such lease, and there has occurred no default by
North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries or event which with the lapse of time
or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a material default by
North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries under any such lease. To the Knowledge
of North Valley, there are no applicable Laws, conditions of record, or other
impediments that materially interfere with the intended use by North Valley
or any of its Subsidiaries of any of the property owned, leased, or occupied
by them.

3.18. _Insurance_.

 

(a) North Valley and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers
against such risks and in such amounts as the management of North Valley
reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practice.
North Valley and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with their
insurance policies and are not in default under any of the material terms
thereof. Each such policy is outstanding and in full force and effect and,
except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of officers,
directors and employees of North Valley and its Subsidiaries and policies on
which a third party is named as an additional insured, North Valley or the
relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole beneficiary of such policies. All
premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been paid, and all
claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion.

(b) The existing insurance carried by North Valley and its Subsidiaries is
sufficient for compliance by North Valley and its Subsidiaries with all
requirements of applicable Laws and agreements to which North Valley or its
Subsidiaries are subject. Section 3.18 of the North Valley Disclosure Letter
contains a true, correct and complete list as of the date hereof of all
material insurance policies and bonds maintained by North Valley and its
Subsidiaries, including the name of the insurer, the policy number, the type
of policy and any applicable deductibles. True, correct and complete copies of
all such policies and bonds set forth in Section 3.18 of the North Valley
Disclosure Letter, as in effect on the date hereof, have been delivered or
made available to TriCo.

 



21 3.19. _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Except as set forth in Section
3.19 of the North Valley Disclosure Letter, each of North Valley and its
Subsidiaries has complied (after giving effect to any non-compliance and cure)
and is in compliance in all material respects with all Laws applicable to it
or to the operation of its business including, without limitation, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act,
the Truth in Lending Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA Patriot Act and
all other applicable bank secrecy laws, fair lending laws and other laws
relating to discriminatory business practices, except for those instances of
noncompliance that are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on North Valley, or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of North Valley to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, North Valley has not been advised of any
regulatory concerns regarding its compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act or
related state or federal anti-money-laundering laws, regulations and
guidelines, including those provisions of federal regulations requiring (i)
the filing of reports, such as Currency Transaction Reports and Suspicious
Activity Reports, (ii) the maintenance of records and (iii) the exercise of
diligence in identifying customers. North Valley has adopted such procedures
and policies as are necessary or appropriate to comply with Title III of the
USA Patriot Act and, to North Valleys Knowledge, North Valley is in
compliance with such law in all material respects. Neither North Valley nor
its Subsidiaries have received any notice in writing of any material alleged
or threatened claim, violation of or liability under any such Laws that has
not heretofore been cured and for which there is any remaining liability.

 

3.20. _Loans_.

 

(a) All loans, loan commitments, letters of credit and other extensions of
credit (including any amendments, renewals, extensions or modifications
thereto) (" _Loans_ ") in which North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries has an
interest, comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws, including,
but not limited to, applicable usury statutes, underwriting and recordkeeping
requirements and the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and other applicable consumer
protection statutes and the regulations thereunder. There are no oral loans,
loan commitments or other extensions of credit owned by North Valley or any
of its Subsidiaries, or in which North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries has
an interest.

 



22 (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.20 of the North Valley Disclosure Letter,
all Loans have been made or acquired by North Valley in all material respects
in accordance with Board of Director-approved loan policies. To the Knowledge
of North Valley, each outstanding Loan of North Valley or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of
indebtedness that are true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the
extent secured, has been secured by valid liens which have been perfected and
(iii) is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or a
court in equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance, and similar Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies
generally. Each of North Valley and its Subsidiaries holds the Loans contained
in its loan portfolio for its own benefit to the extent of its interest shown
therein; such Loans include liens having the priority indicated by their
terms, subject, as of the date of recordation or filing of applicable security
instruments, only to such exceptions as are discussed in attorneys opinions
regarding title or in title insurance policies in the mortgage files relating
to the Loans secured by real property or are not material as to the
collectability of such Loans; all Loans owned by North Valley and its
Subsidiaries or in which North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries has an
interest are with full recourse to the borrowers (except as set forth in
Section 3.20 of the North Valley Disclosure Letter), and neither North Valley
nor its Subsidiaries have taken any action that would result in a waiver or
negation of any rights or remedies available against the borrower or
guarantor, if any, on any Loan, other than in the ordinary course of business.
To the Knowledge of North Valley, all applicable remedies against all
borrowers and guarantors are enforceable except as such enforcement may be
limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or a
court in equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance, and similar Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies
generally. All Loans sold by North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries have been
sold without recourse (except as set forth in Section 3.20 of the North Valley
Disclosure Letter) to North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
with respect to customary representations and warranties) and without any
liability under any yield maintenance or similar obligation.

 

(c) True, correct and complete copies of the currently effective lending
policies of North Valley and its Subsidiaries have been furnished or made
available to TriCo.

(d) Each outstanding Loan participation sold by North Valley or any of its
Subsidiaries was sold with the risk of non-payment of all or any portion of
that underlying Loan to be shared by each participant (including North Valley
or any of its Subsidiaries) proportionately to the share of such Loan
represented by such participation without any recourse of such other lender
or participant to North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries for payment or
repurchase of the amount of such Loan represented by the participation or
liability under any yield maintenance or similar obligation. Each of North
Valley and its Subsidiaries has properly fulfilled in all material respects
its contractual responsibilities and duties in any Loan in which it acts as
the lead lender or servicer and has complied in all material respects with its
duties as required under applicable regulatory requirements.

(e) Each of North Valley and its Subsidiaries has properly perfected or caused
to be properly perfected all security interests, liens, or other interests in
any collateral securing any Loans made by it.

 

3.21. _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither North Valley nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether

licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of any material business conducted by them or the character or location of
any material properties or assets owned or leased by them makes such licensing
or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on TriCo. TriCo is duly
registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve Board. Tri
Counties Bank, TriCo Capital Trust I, and TriCo Capital Trust II are the only
direct or indirect Subsidiaries of TriCo. Section 4.1(a) of the TriCo

Counties Bank, TriCo nor any Subsidiary of TriCo engages in the trust
business or serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative,

Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any Regulatory Agreement.

 

4.12. _State Takeover Laws; Rights Agreement_.

 

(a) TriCo and its Board of Directors have taken, or by the Effective Time will
have taken, all necessary action so that any applicable provisions of the
takeover laws of California and any other state (and any comparable provisions
of TriCos Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws) do not and will not apply to
this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

(b) TriCo has taken all other action necessary or appropriate, if any, so that
the entering into of this Agreement or the Shareholder Agreements, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including
the Merger), do not and will not result in North Valley being or becoming an
"Acquiring Person" thereunder or the ability of any Person to exercise a
"Right" (as defined in the TriCo Rights Agreement) or enabling or requiring
Rights to separate from the shares of TriCo Common Stock to which they are
attached or to be triggered or become exercisable. No "Distribution Date,"
"Shares Acquisition Date" or "Trigger Event" (as such terms are defined in the
TriCo Rights Agreement) has occurred prior to the date of this Agreement, nor
will occur as a result of the entry by TriCo into this Agreement or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



33 4.13. _Environmental Matters_. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private
environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that reasonably could be
expected to result in the imposition, on TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries of
any liability or obligation arising under Environmental Laws, pending or, to
the Knowledge of TriCo, threatened against TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries,
which liability or obligation would have or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on TriCo. To the Knowledge of TriCo, there is
no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that would have
or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on TriCo.
There is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or
governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that
would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on TriCo. To the Knowledge of TriCo, during or prior to the period of (i) its
or any of its Subsidiaries ownership or operation of any of their respective
current properties, (ii) its or any of its Subsidiaries participation in the
management of any property, or (iii) its or any of its Subsidiaries holding
of a security interest in any property, there were no releases or threatened
releases of hazardous, toxic, radioactive or dangerous materials or other
materials regulated under Environmental Laws in, on, under or affecting any
such property which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on TriCo. Neither TriCo nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any court,
governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any material
liability or obligation pursuant to or under any Environmental Laws that
would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on TriCo.

 

4.14. _Allowances for Losses_. All allowances for loan and lease losses of
TriCo and its Subsidiaries, including any reserves for unfunded commitments,
are, and as of the Effective Time will be, made in compliance with all
applicable Laws, TriCos methodology for determining the adequacy of its
allowance for losses and the standards established by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board. Neither TriCo nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been notified by any Governmental Entity or by TriCos
independent auditor, in writing or otherwise, that: (i) such allowances are
inadequate; (ii) the practices and policies of TriCo or any of its
Subsidiaries in establishing such allowances and in accounting for non-
performing and classified assets generally fail to comply with applicable
accounting or regulatory requirements; or (iii) such allowances are
inadequate or inconsistent with the historical loss experience of TriCo or any
of its Subsidiaries. All OREO, if any, held by TriCo or any of its
Subsidiaries is being carried at fair value in accordance with GAAP.

 

4.15. _Insurance_.

(a) TriCo and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers against
such risks and in such amounts as the management of TriCo reasonably has
determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practice. TriCo and its
Subsidiaries are in material compliance with their insurance policies and are
not in default under any of the material terms thereof. Each such policy is
outstanding and in full force and effect and, except for policies insuring
against potential liabilities of officers, directors and employees of TriCo
and its Subsidiaries and policies on which a third party is named as an
additional insured, TriCo or the relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole
beneficiary of such policies. All premiums and other payments due under any
such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in due
and timely fashion.

(b) The existing insurance carried by TriCo and its Subsidiaries is
sufficient for compliance by TriCo and its Subsidiaries with all requirements
of applicable Laws and agreements to which TriCo or its Subsidiaries are
subject.

 



34 4.16. _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Except as set forth in Section 4.16
of the TriCo Disclosure Letter, each of TriCo and its Subsidiaries has
complied (after giving effect to any non-compliance and cure) and is in
compliance in all material respects with all Laws applicable to it or to the
operation of its business including, without limitation, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the
Truth in Lending Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA Patriot Act and
all other applicable bank secrecy laws, fair lending laws and other laws
relating to discriminatory business practices, except for those instances of
noncompliance that are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on TriCo or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of TriCo to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, TriCo has not been advised of any regulatory concerns regarding
its compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act or related state or federal anti-
money-laundering laws, regulations and guidelines, including those provisions
of federal regulations requiring (i) the filing of reports, such as Currency
Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity Reports, (ii) the maintenance of
records and (iii) the exercise of diligence in identifying customers. TriCo
has adopted such procedures and policies as are necessary or appropriate to
comply with Title III of the USA Patriot Act and, to TriCos Knowledge, TriCo
is in compliance with such law in all material respects. Neither TriCo nor its
Subsidiaries have received any notice in writing of any material alleged or
threatened claim, violation of or liability under any such Laws that has not
heretofore been cured and for which there is any remaining liability.

 

4.17. _Loans_.

(a) All Loans in which TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries has an interest,
comply in all material respects with all Laws, including, but not limited to,
applicable usury statutes, underwriting and recordkeeping requirements and the
Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act, and other applicable consumer protection statutes
and the regulations thereunder. There are no oral loans, loan commitments or
other extensions of credit owned by TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries, or in
which TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries has an interest.

(b) All Loans have been made or acquired by TriCo in all material respects in
accordance with Board of Director-approved loan policies. Each of TriCo and
its Subsidiaries holds the Loans contained in its loan portfolio for its own
benefit to the extent of its interest shown therein; such Loans include liens
having the priority indicated by their terms, subject, as of the date of
recordation or filing of applicable security instruments, only to such
exceptions as are discussed in attorneys opinions regarding title or in
title insurance policies in the mortgage files relating to the Loans secured
by real property or are not material as to the collectability of such Loans;
all Loans owned by TriCo and its Subsidiaries or in which TriCo or any of its
Subsidiaries has an interest are with full recourse to the borrowers, and
neither TriCo nor its Subsidiaries have taken any action that would result in
a waiver or negation of any rights or remedies available against the borrower
or guarantor, if any, on any Loan, other than in the ordinary course of
business. To the Knowledge of TriCo, all applicable remedies against all
borrowers and guarantors are enforceable except as such enforcement may be
limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or
a court in equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance, and similar Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies
generally. All Loans sold by TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries have been sold
without recourse to TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries (other than with respect
to customary representations and warranties) and without any liability under
any yield maintenance or similar obligation.

 



35 (c) True, correct and complete copies of the currently effective lending
policies of TriCo and its Subsidiaries have been furnished or made available
to North Valley.

(d) Each outstanding Loan participation sold by TriCo or any of its
Subsidiaries was sold with the risk of non-payment of all or any portion of
that underlying Loan to be shared by each participant (including TriCo or any
of its Subsidiaries) proportionately to the share of such Loan represented by
such participation without any recourse of such other lender or participant
to TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries for payment or repurchase of the amount of
such Loan represented by the participation or liability under any yield
maintenance or similar obligation. Each of TriCo and its Subsidiaries has
properly fulfilled in all material respects its contractual responsibilities
and duties in any Loan in which it acts as the lead lender or servicer and has
complied in all material respects with its duties as required under
applicable regulatory requirements.

(e) Each of TriCo and its Subsidiaries has properly perfected or caused to
be properly perfected all security interests, liens, or other interests in
any collateral securing any Loans made by it.

4.18. _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither TriCo nor any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued
or contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either
alone or when combined with all similar liabilities, has had, or would be
reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on TriCo.

4.19. _Tax Treatment of Merger_. As of the date of this Agreement, TriCo is
not aware of any fact or state of affairs relating to TriCo that could cause
the Merger or the Bank Merger not to be treated as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code.

4.20. _TriCo Information_. The information relating to TriCo and its
Subsidiaries to be contained in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the
Registration Statement, any filings or approvals under applicable state
securities laws, any filing pursuant to Rule 165 or Rule 425 under the
Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act, or in any other
document filed with any other Governmental Entity in connection herewith,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading and will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
the rules and regulations thereunder, and any other governing laws or
regulations, as applicable. No representation or warranty by TriCo, and no
statement by TriCo in any certificate, agreement, schedule or other document
furnished or to be furnished in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, was or will be inaccurate, incomplete or incorrect in any
material respect as of the date furnished or contains or will contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit to state any
material fact necessary to make such representation, warranty or statement
not misleading to North Valley.

 



36 4.21. _Employee Plans_.

 

(a) No TriCo Plan is a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA or a "multiple employer plan," within the meaning of Section 210 of
ERISA or Section 413 of the Code and neither TriCo nor any of its Subsidiaries
has contributed to, or had any obligation to contribute to, any such plan or
arrangement in the previous seven years.

 

(b) No TriCo Plan is an "employee pension benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(2) of ERISA that is or was at any time subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and neither Trico nor any of
its Subsidiaries has contributed to, or had any obligation to contribute to,
any such employee pension benefit plan in the previous seven years.

(c) Other than routine claims for benefits, including those relating to
qualified domestic relations orders, there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of TriCo, threatened lawsuits, governmental investigations or other
claims against or involving any TriCo Plan, or, to the Knowledge of TriCo, any
fiduciary (within the meaning of Section 3(21)(A) of ERISA) or
service provider of any Plan, nor, to the Knowledge of TriCo, is there any
reasonable basis for any such lawsuit, investigation or claim.

(d) For purposes of this Section 4.21, "TriCo Plan" shall mean each pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, savings, deferred compensation, stock option,
restricted stock or other equity-based compensation, severance, retention,
change in control, termination, bonus, incentive compensation, fringe
benefit, vacation, life insurance, disability, accident, supplemental benefit,
welfare, medical, dental, vision, education reimbursement, compensation or
other employee benefit plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement,
including, but not limited to, each "employee benefit plan" (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of _ERISA_ , whether or not subject to ERISA), that is
maintained, sponsored, contributed to or required to be contributed to as of
the date of this Agreement or with respect to which TriCo or any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation, contingent or otherwise,
including by reason of being or having been treated as a "single employer"
with any other trade or business within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA
or Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

 

4.22 _Certain Contracts_. Neither TriCo nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or bound by any written or oral contract, plan, commitment or any other
arrangement with respect to the employment of any directors, officers,
employees or consultants (each a " _TriCo Contract_ "): (i) which, upon the
execution of this Agreement, the TriCo Requisite Vote or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional acts or events) result in or accelerate any
payment or benefit (whether severance, retirement, change of control
or otherwise) becoming due from TriCo, North Valley, any of their
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation to any party, (ii) which contains a
non-compete or client or customer non-solicitation requirement or any other
provision that materially restricts the conduct of any line of business by
TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries or, following the Closing, TriCo or any of
its Subsidiaries; or (iii) with or to a labor union or guild (including any
collective bargaining agreement). Each TriCo Contract is a valid and binding
commitment of TriCo or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and is in
full force and effect; (ii) each of TriCo and its Subsidiaries has in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to
date under each TriCo Contract; (iii) no event or condition exists which
constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute, a
material default on the part of TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries under any
such TriCo Contract; and (iv) neither TriCo nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received notice of any violation or imminent violation of any TriCo Contract
by any other party thereto. True, correct and complete copies of each TriCo
Contract have been provided or made available to North Valley prior to the
date hereof.

Executive Vice President of TriCo or Tri Counties Bank, or any designee
designated in writing by such persons. With respect to any written request by
North Valley for TriCos consent to any non-permitted action of North Valley
or any North Valley Subsidiary described in this Section 5.1, TriCo shall not
unreasonably withhold or delay its consent.

 



43 5.2. _Covenants of TriCo_.

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, except
as expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or disclosed in the
TriCo Disclosure Letter or with North Valleys prior written consent, TriCo
shall not, and shall not permit Tri Counties Bank to:

 

(i) take any action that is intended or may reasonably be expected to result
in any of TriCos representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
being or becoming untrue or any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article VII not being satisfied or in a violation of any provision of this
Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement, except, in every case, as may be
required by applicable Laws;

(ii) amend its Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or other similar
governing documents unless required to do so in order to comply with
applicable Laws or regulations or by regulatory directive;

 

(iii) take or omit to take any action that would have or be reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on TriCo or that would have or be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on, or materially delay,
the ability of TriCo and North Valley to obtain the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals (as defined in Section 7.1) or otherwise have or be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on TriCos and Tri
Counties Banks ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or

 

(iv) agree or commit to do any of the actions set forth in clauses (i)(iii)
of this Section 5.2(a).

 

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, TriCo
shall promptly notify North Valley of any change, occurrence or event not in
the ordinary course of its or any Subsidiarys business, and of any change,
occurrence or event which, individually or in the aggregate with any
other changes, occurrences and events, would reasonably be expected to cause
any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied
prior to the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, TriCo
undertakes and agrees with North Valley that it shall not solicit or accept
any offer from any third party in the nature of an Acquisition Proposal
involving TriCo in a business combination with such third party or other
entity, unless such offer is expressly conditioned upon the performance by
TriCo (or the successor in interest of TriCo) of all of its obligations under
this Agreement in a manner such that the value of the consideration to be paid
to the North Valley shareholders under this Agreement is not thereby reduced.

 



44 (d) Without limiting the generality or effect of the provisions of Sections
5.2(a), (b) and (c), during the period from the date hereof and continuing
until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
TriCo shall not, and shall cause each Subsidiary not to, do, cause or permit
any of the following, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in
this Agreement or as consented to in writing by North Valley:

(i) declare or pay any distributions on or in respect of any of its capital
stock other than ordinary quarterly cash dividends in conformity with past
practice, or with respect to Tri Counties Bank, declare or pay dividends to
TriCo other than in conformity with past practice and applicable law and for
the purpose of enabling TriCo to pay interest on its Junior Subordinated Debt
Securities and to pay its ordinary operating expenses, in each case in
accordance with past practice and as they become due;

 

(ii) (a) split, combine or reclassify any shares of its capital stock or
issue, authorize or propose the issuance of any other securities in respect
of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of its capital stock, except the
grant of awards pursuant to the TriCo Equity Plans, and upon the exercise or
fulfillment of TriCo Options issued and outstanding as of the date hereof or
(b) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire shares of its capital stock
(except in partial or complete satisfaction of debts previously contracted, or
upon the forfeiture of any outstanding shares of restricted stock) other
than (x) not more than 333,400 shares of TriCo Common Stock currently
remaining available for repurchase under the TriCo stock repurchase plan
adopted and announced on August 21, 2007), (y) shares of the capital stock of
TriCo or any TriCo Subsidiaries, or any securities convertible into or
exercisable for any shares of the capital stock of TriCo or any TriCo
Subsidiaries and shares of TriCo Common Stock on behalf of the TriCo Employee
Stock Ownership Plan; and (z) shares delivered by holders of TriCo Stock
Options in connection with the exercise of such options;

(iii) issue, allocate, deliver or sell, or authorize or propose the issuance,
delivery or sale of, any shares of its capital stock or any securities
convertible into or exercisable for, or any rights, warrants or options to
acquire, any such shares, or enter into any agreement with respect to any of
the foregoing, other than the issuance of TriCo Options and other awards
pursuant to the TriCo Equity Plans and TriCo Common Stock pursuant to TriCo
Options or other awards granted pursuant to the TriCo Equity Plans; or

(iv) take any action that could, or fail to take any action, the failure of
which could, reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

The consent of North Valley to any action by TriCo or Tri Counties Bank that
is not permitted by any of the preceding paragraphs shall be evidenced only by
a writing signed by the President or any Executive Vice President of North
Valley. With respect to any written request by TriCo for North Valleys
consent to any non-permitted action of TriCo described in this Section 5.2,
North Valley shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent.

 



45 5.3. _Merger Covenants_. Notwithstanding that North Valley believes that it
has established all allowances and taken all provisions for losses required
by GAAP and applicable Laws, North Valley recognizes that TriCo may have
adopted different loan, accrual and allowance policies (including loan
classifications and levels of allowances for losses). In that regard and in
general from and after the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, North
Valley and TriCo shall consult and cooperate with each other in order to
formulate the plan of integration for the Merger, including, among other
things, with respect to conforming immediately prior to the Effective Time,
based upon such consultation, North Valleys loan, accrual and allowance
policies to those policies of TriCo to the extent consistent with GAAP,
_provided, however_ , that no such additional accruals and loss allowances
will be: (i) required to be made more than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date and only after all conditions under Article VII have been
satisfied or waived or (ii) deemed to have a Material Adverse Effect upon
North Valley if made upon TriCos written request.

ARTICLE VI.

 

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 

6.1. _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, TriCo and North Valley
shall promptly cause the Registration Statement to be prepared and TriCo
shall cause the Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC. TriCo and
North Valley shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable
after the filing thereof. The parties shall cooperate in responding to and
considering any questions or comments from the SEC staff regarding the
information contained in the Registration Statement. If at any time after the
Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, and prior to the Closing Date,
any event relating to North Valley or TriCo is discovered by North Valley or
TriCo, as applicable, which should be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Registration Statement, the discovering party shall
promptly inform the other party with all relevant information relating to such
event, whereupon TriCo shall promptly cause an appropriate amendment to the
Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC. Upon the effectiveness of
such amendment, each of North Valley and TriCo (if prior to the meetings of
the shareholders pursuant to Section 6.3 hereof) will take all necessary
action as promptly as practicable to permit an appropriate amendment
or supplement to be transmitted to the shareholders entitled to vote at such
meetings. TriCo shall also use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and North Valley shall
furnish all information concerning North Valley and the holders of North
Valley Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action. If the SEC requires a tax opinion in connection with the filing of
the Registration Statement or before it will declare the registration
statement effective, (i) TriCo shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause its tax advisor to provide such opinion addressed to TriCo
and (ii) North Valley shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
cause its tax advisor to provide such opinion addressed to North Valley;
_provided,_ that the issuance of such opinions shall be conditioned upon the
receipt by such tax advisors of customary representation letters from each of
TriCo and North Valley in a form reasonably agreed to by the parties, and the
parties shall otherwise reasonably cooperate with each other in the issuance
of such tax opinions.

 



46 (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, waivers, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and any Governmental Entity that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including without limitation, the Merger and the Bank Merger).
North Valley and TriCo shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to North Valley or TriCo, as the case may be, which appears in any
regulatory application made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, counsel to North Valley shall be
provided with a draft of all regulatory applications for its review and
approval not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the filing or
submission of such applications with any Governmental Entity. The parties
hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein. Each of TriCo and North Valley shall use
their reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections or any Burdensome
Condition (as defined below) that may be asserted or imposed by any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this
Agreement, under no circumstances shall either party or its Subsidiaries be
required, and neither North Valley nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
permitted (without TriCos written consent in its sole discretion), to take
any action or commit to take any action or agree to any condition,
restriction or requirement involving any of them, pursuant to this Section
6.1 or otherwise in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
waivers, approvals and authorizations, that the TriCo Board determines in good
faith would, or would be reasonably likely to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation
(assuming for this purpose that the Surviving Corporation consists of TriCo
and North Valley and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided,_ that the sale, consolidation,
divestiture or other disposition of one or more branch offices of TriCo or
North Valley in a geographic banking market shall not constitute, or be taken
into account in determining the existence of a Burdensome Condition.

(c) North Valley and TriCo shall each furnish the other with all information
concerning each other and its directors, officers and shareholders and such
other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with
the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of TriCo or
North Valley to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) TriCo and North Valley shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent, waiver or approval
is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval (as defined in Section
7.1(c) hereof) will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval
will be materially delayed or will contain any Burdensome Condition.

 



47 6.2. _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, North Valley and TriCo shall each accord to the
Representatives (defined below) of TriCo and North Valley, as applicable,
access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, shall make
available to TriCo and North Valley, respectively, (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, and other document filed or received by it (including by its
Subsidiaries) during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or federal or state banking laws and (ii) all other
information concerning its (including its Subsidiaries) business, properties
and personnel as TriCo or North Valley may reasonably request. TriCo shall
receive notice of all meetings of North Valley and its Subsidiaries Board of
Directors (in all cases, at least as timely as all North Valley and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, representatives to such meetings are
required to be provided notice), and a representative of TriCo shall have the
right to attend the portions of such meetings that do not pertain to: (i)
confidential matters as reasonably determined by such Board of Directors; (ii)
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby; or (iii)
matters relating to a Superior Proposal. North Valley and TriCo shall each
provide to the other true, correct and complete copies of all financial and
other information relating to their respective business or operations
including their Subsidiaries (except for information that is attorney-client
privileged) that is provided to directors of North Valley or its Subsidiaries
and TriCo and its Subsidiaries in connection with meetings of their
respective Boards of Directors or committees thereof. Set forth in Section 6.2
of the North Valley Disclosure Letter is an estimate of the expenses North
Valley expects to incur in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, and North Valley
shall keep TriCo reasonably informed of material changes in such estimate.

 

(b) TriCo and North Valley entered into a Confidentiality Agreement dated
January 7, 2013 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in effect and apply to the information furnished by
TriCo and North Valley pursuant to this Section 6.2.

 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
Representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the
other set forth herein.

6.3. _Shareholder Meetings_.

 

(a) Each of TriCo and North Valley shall take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Law and their respective Articles
of Incorporation, Bylaws or similar organizational documents to duly call,
give notice of, convene and, as soon as practicable but not later than sixty
(60) days after the Registration Statement is declared effective, hold a
meeting of its shareholders and, except as otherwise provided herein, use its
reasonable best efforts to take such other actions necessary to obtain the
relevant shareholder approvals, in each case as promptly as practicable for
the purpose of obtaining the Requisite TriCo Vote, in the case of TriCo, and
the Requisite North Valley Vote. North Valley and TriCo shall cooperate to
schedule and convene the North Valley Meeting and the TriCo Meeting on the
same date.

 



48 (b) Except in the case of a Change in Recommendation expressly permitted by
Section 6.7, North Valley shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain, the Requisite North Valley Vote at the North Valley Meeting.
Subject to Section 6.7(d), North Valley shall (i) through the North Valley
Board, recommend to its shareholders adoption of this Agreement (the " _North
Valley Board Recommendation_ "), (ii) include such recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
North Valley Requisite Vote from its shareholders. North Valley hereby
acknowledges its obligation to submit this Agreement to its shareholders at
the North Valley Meeting as provided in this Section 6.3. In addition to the
foregoing, North Valley agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of its
shareholders at or prior to the North Valley Meeting any proposal (including
but not limited to an Acquisition Proposal) other than the Merger and any
proposal required by SEC Rule 14a-21(c) as a result of the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that North
Valley may withdraw, modify, qualify or otherwise effect a Change in
Recommendation from the North Valley Board Recommendation if an
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal as determined by the North Valley
Board in accordance with Section 6.7 and North Valley may include disclosures
in the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto as may be
submitted to North Valley shareholders describing the reasons therefor along
with the terms of any such Superior Proposal, all as the North Valley Board
deems appropriate and necessary in the exercise of its fiduciary duties to
North Valley shareholders.

 

(c) TriCo shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the
Requisite TriCo Vote at the TriCo Meeting. TriCo shall (i) through its Board
of Directors, recommend to its shareholders adoption of this Agreement, (ii)
include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and (iii) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite TriCo Vote from its
shareholders.

(d) Each party shall cooperate and keep the other party informed on a current
basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the
dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the shareholders of
each party. If at any time following the dissemination of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (i) North Valley reasonably determines in good faith
that the Requisite TriCo Vote is unlikely to be obtained at the TriCo Meeting,
or (ii) TriCo reasonably determines in good faith that the Requisite North
Valley Vote is unlikely to be obtained at the North Valley Meeting, then prior
to the vote contemplated having been taken such party may request that the
other party adjourn or postpone its meeting for up to forty-five (45) days
from then-scheduled date and the other party shall comply with such request;
provided that a party shall be required to adjourn or postpone its meeting on
only one occasion. During such period of adjournment or postponement, the
parties shall continue in all respects to comply with their obligations under
this Section 6.3 and shall in good faith use reasonable best efforts to
obtain shareholder approval or negotiate a restructuring of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement including the Merger and the Bank Merger (it
being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or
change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration in a manner adverse to
such party or its shareholders) and, subject to this Section 6.3, seek to
obtain the Requisite TriCo Vote and/or the Requisite North Valley Vote, as
the case may be. Except as set forth in this Section 6.3, no party shall have
the obligation to postpone or adjourn its shareholder meeting.

 



49 6.4. _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of TriCo and North Valley shall use their reasonable best
efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may
be imposed on such party with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and,
subject to the conditions of Article VII hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order
or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other
third party which is required to be obtained by North Valley or TriCo in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5. _Nasdaq Listing_. TriCo shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of TriCo Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved
for quotation on NASDAQ prior to or at the Effective Time.

6.6. _Employees_. 

(a) To the extent permissible under the applicable provisions of the Code and
ERISA, for purposes of crediting periods of service for eligibility to
participate and vesting, but not for benefit accrual purposes, under TriCo
Plans that are employee pension benefit plans (within the meaning of ERISA
Section 3(2)), individuals who are employees (including, but not limited
to, those who are on unpaid leave, paid leave and active employees) of North
Valley or any North Valley Subsidiary at the Effective Time will be credited
with periods of service with North Valley or the applicable North Valley
Subsidiary before the Effective Time as if such service had been with TriCo
or a TriCo Subsidiary, as applicable; provided that the foregoing shall not
apply (i) for benefit accrual purposes, (ii) as would result in the
duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (iii) for purposes of
any "frozen" TriCo Plan for which new TriCo employees are generally not
eligible or (iv) for any newly established TriCo Plan for which similarly
situated employees of TriCo do not receive service credit for the period in
question. Notwithstanding the preceding, the parties recognize that North
Valley intends to maintain the North Valley 401(k) Plan through the Effective
Time and to make matching contributions to the North Valley 401(k) Plan on
behalf of eligible employees. With regard to participation by the employees
who are eligible to participate in the North Valley 401(k) Plan prior to the
Effective Time: (i) such employees shall be eligible to participate
in TriCos 401(k) Savings Plan (the " _TriCo 401(k) Plan_ ") immediately upon
their becoming TriCo or TriCo Subsidiary employees incident to this
transaction; (ii) such employees shall be eligible for the employer
contributions in the TriCo 401(k) Plan, if any (whether match, profit-sharing
or both), with regard to eligible compensation earned by them from TriCo or
the TriCo Subsidiary following the Effective Time until the last day of the
TriCo 401(k) Plan year that includes the Effective Time.

 



50 (b) To the extent permissible under the applicable provisions of the Code,
ERISA and the applicable TriCo Plans (except as to reasonable amendments that
TriCo shall make to accommodate a provision that is permitted under the Code
and ERISA), TriCo will or will cause its applicable Subsidiary to (i) give
credit to employees of North Valley and its Subsidiaries, with respect to the
satisfaction of the waiting periods for participation and coverage which are
applicable under the TriCo Plans that are welfare benefit plans, equal to the
credit that any such employee had received as of the Effective Time towards
the satisfaction of any such limitations and waiting periods under the
comparable North Valley Plans that are welfare benefit plans; (ii) make
reasonable commercial efforts to cause each TriCo Plan that is a group health
plan (including medical, dental and prescription drug) and that is made
available to employees of North Valley and its Subsidiaries in the plan year
which includes the Effective Time to provide each employee of North Valley and
its Subsidiaries with credit for any co-payment and deductibles in such plan
year paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
employee of North Valley and its Subsidiaries who has satisfied the
applicable waiting periods for eligibility or participation in any TriCo Plan
that is made available, in TriCos sole discretion, to such employee as of the
effective time after credit for pre-Effective Time service has been given
shall begin participating in such TriCo Plan immediately after the Effective
Time without the need to wait for any open enrollment periods or plan entry
dates; and (ii) each employee of North Valley and its Subsidiaries who has
satisfied the applicable waiting periods for eligibility or participation in
any North Valley Plan that is a medical plan, dental plan, disability plan or
life insurance plan (excepting plans maintained only for a select group, such
as executives), shall begin participating in the comparable TriCo Plan
immediately after the Effective Time; and (iii) each TriCo Plan that provides
severance or vacation/paid time off benefits and that is made available to
any employee of North Valley or its Subsidiaries who continues employment
with the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries following the
Effective Time shall recognize service with North Valley and its Subsidiaries
that was recognized by North Valley under the equivalent North Valley Plan.
For illustration, if an employee of TriCo with 10 years of service is eligible
to accrue four weeks of vacation in a calendar year under a Trico Plan, then a
North Valley employee with 10 years of North Valley service who becomes a
TriCo employee as of the Effective Time due to this transaction will accrue
four weeks of vacation with TriCo in the calendar year under such Trico Plan.

 

(c) TriCo or one of its Subsidiaries shall provide severance benefits to those
employees of North Valley and its Subsidiaries who continue in employment
with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries through the
Effective Time and whose employment is involuntarily terminated by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries without cause at or within 180 days
after the Effective Time (other than employees who are entitled to receive
severance payments under any employment, severance or similar plans or
agreements as set forth in Section 3.11 of the North Valley Disclosure Letter)
in accordance with TriCos current written severance policy as previously
delivered to North Valley.

(d) There shall be no North Valley ESOP loans nor any unallocated accounts in
respect of any North Valley ESOP loans as of the Effective Time. North Valley
shall continue to make employer contributions to the North Valley ESOP for
each plan year quarter ending on or before the Effective Time, provided such
contributions are comparable in amount, on a prorated basis, to past employer
contributions to the North Valley ESOP.

(e) North Valley shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to
cause the fiduciaries of the North Valley ESOP to take all of the following
actions:

 

(i) Implement a written confidential pass-through voting procedure pursuant to
which the participants under the North Valley ESOP and their beneficiaries
shall direct the trustee under the North Valley ESOP to vote the shares of
North Valley Common Stock allocated to their North Valley ESOP accounts with
respect to the Merger.

 



51 (ii) Provide the North Valley ESOP participants and their beneficiaries with a
written notice regarding the existence of and provisions for such
confidential pass-through voting procedures, as well as the same written
materials to be provided to the shareholders of North Valley in connection
with the Merger.

 

(iii) Take any and all additional actions necessary to satisfy the
requirements of ERISA applicable to the North Valley ESOP fiduciaries
in connection with the Merger.

(f) If and to the extent requested by TriCo in a writing delivered to North
Valley following the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, North Valley
shall take all necessary action (including without limitation the adoption of
resolutions and plan amendments and the delivery of any required notices) to
terminate, effective as of no later than immediately prior to the Closing
Date, the North Valley ESOP. North Valley shall provide TriCo with a copy of
the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents prepared to
effectuate the termination of the North Valley ESOP in advance and give TriCo
a reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents (which comments shall be
considered in good faith), and prior to the Closing Date North Valley shall
provide TriCo with the final board resolutions evidencing that the ESOP
has been terminated. The termination of the North Valley ESOP will be adopted
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and upon receiving a favorable
determination letter from the IRS with regard to (i) the continued
qualification of the North Valley ESOP after any required amendments
necessary to implement the actions thereof set forth above and (ii) the
termination of the North Valley ESOP. North Valley and TriCo will cooperate in
submitting appropriate requests for any such determination and termination
letters to the IRS and will use their best efforts to seek the issuance of
such letters as soon as practicable following the date hereof; _provided,
however_ , that North Valley does not represent or warrant that it shall
begin the determination letter process as to the termination of the North
Valley ESOP prior to Closing. North Valley will adopt such additional
amendments to the North Valley ESOP as may be reasonably required by the IRS
as a condition to granting such favorable determination and termination
letters provided that such amendments do not substantially change the terms
outlined herein or would result in a material adverse change in the business,
operations, assets, financial condition or prospects of North Valley or TriCo
or result in an additional material liability to TriCo or North Valley.

(g) If and to the extent requested by TriCo in a writing delivered to North
Valley following the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, (i) North
Valley shall take all necessary action (including without limitation the
adoption of resolutions and plan amendments and the delivery of any required
notices), effective no later than the last day of the regularly scheduled
payroll period immediately preceding the Closing Date, to freeze all
contributions to the North Valley ESOP; and (ii) as soon as administratively
feasible after the Effective Time, at the election of TriCo, the North Valley
ESOP shall be merged with and into the TriCo ESOP.

 

(h) Effective no later than the last day of the regularly scheduled payroll
period immediately preceding the Closing Date, North Valley shall freeze
contributions to the North Valley 401(k) Plan. Effective no later than the day
before the Closing Date, North Valley shall terminate the North Valley 401(k)
Plan by proper action of the North Valley Board and the board of directors of
North Valley Bank. Before the Closing Date, North Valley shall provide to
TriCo (i) copies of duly adopted board resolutions terminating the North
Valley 401(k) Plan, and (ii) an executed amendment to the North Valley 401(k)
Plan sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the
Code and regulations thereunder. The resolution and amendment shall be subject
to the prior review and approval of TriCo.

 



52 (i) North Valley shall terminate, in accordance with its terms and applicable
Laws, effective prior to the Closing Date, each North Valley Plan providing
for group health, dental, vision, prescription drugs or other welfare benefit
coverage to any former employees, officers, directors or consultants and/or
their spouses and other dependents. At the request of TriCo, North Valley
shall terminate or discontinue accruals under any and all other North Valley
Plans, including any group health, dental, severance, separation or salary
continuation plans, programs or arrangements, effective either immediately
before the Closing Date or thereafter as specified by TriCo; provided,
however, that North Valley shall not be required to terminate any North Valley
Plan identified in Schedule 6.6(i).

 

(j) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be
interpreted or construed to confer upon any employee of North Valley or any
of its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time with any right with
respect to continuance of employment by or other service with the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, nor shall this Agreement interfere in
any way with the right of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
terminate the employment or other association of any Person at any time.
Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment of, or interfere in
any way with the right of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
amend, terminate or otherwise discontinue, any or all TriCo Plans and any
other plans, practices or policies of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries in effect from time to time.

(k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section
6.6 shall create any third party beneficiary right in any Person, and no
provision in this Agreement shall create any right to employment or continued
employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.7. _No Solicitation; Change of Recommendation_.

 

(a) North Valley agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, advisors and agents
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than TriCo and its
affiliates and Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any
proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below). Except as expressly permitted in this
Section 6.7, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1, North Valley shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, or otherwise participate in any
discussions (except for the limited purpose of notifying such person of the
existence of the provisions of this Section 6.7) or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Acquisition
Proposal or Alternative Transaction (as defined below), (iv) furnish to any
person any information concerning North Valley, or any access to the
properties, books and records of North Valley and its Subsidiaries, in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) propose, agree or publicly
announce an intention to take any of the foregoing actions or any other action
which would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. North
Valley shall use commercially reasonable efforts to request all Persons other
than TriCo, TriCos Representatives and North Valleys Representatives who
have been furnished confidential information regarding North Valley in
connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition
Proposal within the eighteen (18) months prior to the date hereof promptly to
return or destroy such information. Except as permitted by this Section 6.7,
North Valley agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any
third party from, and agrees to enforce, the confidentiality and standstill
provisions of any agreement to which North Valley or its Subsidiaries is a
party that remains in effect as of the date hereof, and shall immediately
take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been
heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any Person to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

 



53 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.7, if
at any time after the date hereof and prior to obtaining North Valley
Shareholder Approval, North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its
or their respective Representatives, having each theretofore complied with the
terms of Section 6.7(a), receives a bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal, North Valley, the North Valley Board and their
respective Representatives may engage in negotiations and discussions with,
and furnish any information and other access (so long as all such information
and access has previously been made available to TriCo or is made available to
TriCo prior to or concurrently with the time such information or access is
made available to such Person) to, any Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives if, and only if, the North Valley Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with North Valleys outside legal
and financial advisors, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal is or is reasonably
capable of becoming a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure of the North
Valley Board to furnish such information or access or enter into such
discussions or negotiations would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of North Valley under applicable
Law; _provided_ that prior to furnishing any material nonpublic information,
North Valley shall have received from the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least as
restrictive in all material respects on such Person as the Confidentiality
Agreement is on TriCo, which confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit
North Valley from complying with the terms of this Section 6.7. North Valley
will promptly, and in any event within one (1) Business Day, (x) notify TriCo
in writing of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information relating to North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the properties, books or records of North Valley or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Person that has made, or to North Valleys Knowledge may
be considering making, an Acquisition Proposal and (y) communicate the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal to TriCo, including as they may
change upon any modification or amendment to the terms thereof. North Valley
will keep TriCo reasonably apprised of the status of and other matters
relating to any such Acquisition Proposal on a timely basis.

 



54 (c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.7, neither North Valley
nor the North Valley Board shall (i)(A) withdraw, modify or qualify, or
publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to TriCo,
the North Valley Board Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, to the shareholders of North Valley any
Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction or (ii) authorize, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose to adopt, approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or allow North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or similar agreement with respect to,
or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 6.2(b) pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations set forth
therein) (any action described in this Section 6.7(c) being referred to as a
" _Change of Recommendation")._

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, the North Valley Board may make
a Change of Recommendation, if (A) North Valley has complied with the terms of
this Section 6.7, (B) the North Valley Board receives an unsolicited bona
fide, written Acquisition Proposal from any Person that is not withdrawn and
(C) the North Valley Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that:

(i) the North Valley Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the North Valley Board to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be a violation of its
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of North Valley under applicable Law; and

 

(ii) (1) North Valley provides TriCo prior written notice at least five (5)
Business Days (or such longer period as it may be extended upon the
modification or amendment of the Acquisition Proposal as contemplated below)
prior to taking such action, which notice shall state that the North Valley
Board has received a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the North Valley Board has resolved to
effect a Change of Recommendation, which notice shall specify the basis for
such Change of Recommendation or termination, including the material terms of
the Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it being
understood that such Notice of Superior Proposal shall not in and of itself be
deemed a Change of Recommendation);

 

(2) during such five (5) Business Day period (as it may be extended upon the
modification or amendment of the Acquisition Proposal as contemplated below),
North Valley negotiates in good faith with TriCo (to the extent that TriCo
wishes to negotiate) to enable TriCo to make an offer that is at least as
favorable to the shareholders of North Valley so that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

(3) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period (as it may be extended
upon the modification or amendment of the Acquisition Proposal as contemplated
below, or such earlier time that TriCo advises North Valley in writing that it
no longer wishes to negotiate to amend this Agreement), the North Valley
Board, after taking into account any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement and the Merger agreed to by TriCo after receipt of such notice,
continues to believe that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal.

 



55 It is understood that and agreed that any amendment or modification to the
financial or other material terms of the Acquisition Proposal giving rise to
the Notice of Superior Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal
giving rise to a new five (5) Business Day response period for TriCo,
consequently extending the periods referenced in Sections 6.7(d)(ii)(1)-(3)
above.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit North Valley from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to its shareholders any
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, provided that any disclosure under Rule 14e-2(a)(1) shall be
deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the North Valley Board
expressly and concurrently reaffirms the North Valley Board Recommendation.

 

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any
proposal or offer (whether in writing or otherwise) from any Person (other
than TriCo and any affiliates thereof) relating to, or that is reasonably
expected to lead to, (A) any direct or indirect purchase or acquisition, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, of any assets
or businesses of North Valley and its Subsidiaries (including securities of
Subsidiaries) that constitute 5% or more of North Valleys consolidated
assets, (B) any direct or indirect purchase or acquisition, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, of beneficial ownership (as
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 5% or more of the total
outstanding voting securities of North Valley pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock,
tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction, or (C) a merger, share
exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving North Valley
or North Valley Bank, other than the Merger or the Bank Merger (any such
transaction described in clauses (A) and (B) an " _Alternative Transaction_
").

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal on terms which the North Valley Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with North Valleys outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisors, and taking into account all the
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal,
including as to certainty and timing of consummation, would, if consummated,
result in a transaction that is more favorable to the holders of North Valley
Common Stock from a financial point of view than the terms of this Agreement
(in each case, taking into account any revisions to this Agreement made or
proposed by TriCo); _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal," the references to "5% or more" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "100%."

 



56 6.8. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
or employee of North Valley or any North Valley Subsidiary (the "
_Indemnified Parties")_ is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of North Valley
or any North Valley Subsidiary or any of their respective predecessors or
(ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in
any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties
hereto agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend
against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that, after the
Effective Time, TriCo shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Laws, each such Indemnified Party against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Laws (upon receipt of any undertaking required
by applicable Laws from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses
if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before
or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to TriCo;  _provided, however_ , that (1) TriCo shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption TriCo
shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except that if TriCo elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises
the Indemnified Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between TriCo and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties
may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to TriCo, and TriCo shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2)
TriCo shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm
of counsel reasonably required in each applicable jurisdiction for such
Indemnified Parties, and (3) TriCo shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 6.8, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify TriCo
thereof; _provided, however,_ that the failure to so notify shall not affect
the obligations of TriCo under this Section 6.8 except to the extent such
failure to notify prejudices TriCo. TriCos obligations under this Section
6.8 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such claim.

(b) TriCo and North Valley shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the persons serving as officers and directors of North Valley and the North
Valley Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered by a
directors and officers liability insurance tail policy obtained from
North Valleys current insurance carrier (the " _Tail Insurance Policy_ ") of
substantially the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
which are generally not less advantageous than North Valleys current
policy with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such for a period of six (6) years _provided, however_ , that in no event
shall the cost of the Tail Insurance Policy be more than two hundred seventy-
five percent (275%) of the current amount expended on an annual basis by North
Valley for its current policy; _provided, further,_ that if the Tail Insurance
Policy cannot be obtained as called for by this Section 6.7(b), TriCo shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance
as is available; _provided, further_ , that officers and directors of North
Valley may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to an insurance carrier for the purpose of
obtaining the Tail Insurance Policy.

 



57 (c) This Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and is intended to
benefit each indemnified person (each of whom shall be entitled to enforce
this Section against TriCo) and shall be binding on all successors and assigns
of TriCo.

 

(d) In the event TriCo or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to one or more
other Persons, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of TriCo assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.8.

6.9. _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, or to vest the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank with
full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, or the constituent parties to
the Bank Merger, as the case may be, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement and TriCos Subsidiaries and North
Valleys Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by TriCo.

6.10. _Advice of Changes_. TriCo and North Valley shall promptly advise the
other party of any change or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has
had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or
to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein. From time to time prior to the
Effective Time, each party will promptly supplement or amend its disclosure
letter delivered in connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect
any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
disclosure letter or which is necessary to correct any information in such
disclosure letter which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement
or amendment to such disclosure letter shall have any effect for the purpose
of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof,
as the case may be, or the compliance by North Valley or TriCo, as the case
may be, with the respective covenants set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2
hereof.

6.11. _Current Information_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, each party will cause one or more of its
designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis (not less
than monthly) with representatives of the other party and to report the
general status of its ongoing operations. Each party will promptly notify the
other party of any material change in the normal course of business or in the
operation of the properties of itself or any of its Subsidiaries and of any
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of litigation involving itself or any of its Subsidiaries, and will
keep the other party fully informed of such events.

 



58 6.12. _Bank Merger Agreement_. Prior to the Effective Time, (a) TriCo and
North Valley shall each approve the Bank Merger Agreement as the sole
shareholder of Tri Counties Bank and North Valley Bank, respectively, and (b)
North Valley Bank, on the one hand or Tri Counties Bank, on the other, shall
execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement.

6.13. _Change in Structure_. TriCo may elect to modify the structure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as noted herein so long as (i)
there are no adverse tax consequences to the North Valley shareholders as a
result of such modification, (ii) the consideration and other benefits to be
paid to or received by the North Valley shareholders and optionees, and the
North Valley directors, officers and employees under this Agreement are not
thereby changed or reduced in amount, or (iii) such modification will not
delay or jeopardize receipt of any Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In
the event that the structure of the Merger is modified pursuant to this
Section 6.13, the parties agree to modify this Agreement and the various
exhibits hereto to reflect such revised structure. In such event, TriCo shall
prepare appropriate amendments to this Agreement and the exhibits hereto for
execution by the parties hereto. North Valley agrees to cooperate fully with
TriCo to effect such amendments.

 

6.14. _Exemption From Section 16 Liability_. Prior to the Effective Time,
TriCo and North Valley shall take all such actions including, without
limitation, action by the North Valley Board and the TriCo Board, as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of North Valley
Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of
such shares of North Valley Common Stock in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.15. _Board of Directors_. At or promptly following the Effective Time, TriCo
shall take all action necessary to appoint three (3) members of the North
Valley Board, each of whom shall be selected by TriCo, to each of the TriCo
Board and the board of directors of Tri Counties Bank. TriCo agrees that the
TriCo Board and its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall in
good faith consider the nomination of each such member of the North Valley
Board at each annual or special meeting of TriCo shareholders from and after
the Effective Time through the year ended 2015 at which a proposal to elect
directors is voted upon.

6.16. _North Valley Options_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, North Valley shall take such actions as may
be necessary such that immediately prior to the Effective Time each North
Valley Option, whether or not then vested and whether or not then exercisable,
shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof, as soon as
reasonably practicable after surrender thereof, to receive an amount, if any,
in cash, without interest, from North Valley equal to the product of (x) the
total number of Shares subject to the North Valley Option times (y) the
excess, if any, of the product of the Stock Exchange Ratio multiplied by the
weighted average of the closing prices for shares of TriCo Common Stock as
quoted on NASDAQ for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date over the exercise price per
share under such North Valley Option less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment. At the Effective Time, each option to
purchase a share of North Valley Common Stock whether or not then vested and
whether or not then exercisable, shall terminate and be of no further effect
and any rights thereunder to purchase shares of North Valley Common Stock
shall also terminate and be of no further force or effect. Without limiting
the foregoing, no such amount shall be payable to the holder of a
North Valley Option cancelled pursuant to this Section 6.16 if the North
Valley Option is out-of-the-money; _provided, however,_ that in consideration
of the cancellation of such out-of-the-money North Valley Option, the holder
shall be entitled to payment of such consideration as may be determined by
the North Valley Board and approved by TriCo. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, the North Valley Board shall have the absolute
right to amend any or all option plans and agreements governing any or all
outstanding North Valley Options to make such North Valley Options fully
vested and exercisable prior to the Closing Date so as to permit the holder of
such North Valley Options to exercise such North Valley Options (and thereby,
at the holders discretion, to convert to a share of stock to which such North
Valley Option is subject) prior to the date on which such North Valley Options
otherwise would terminate and/or liquidate under this Section 6.16.

 



59 (b) In addition, if so requested by TriCo, at least twenty (20) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time and prior to any such payment, North Valley shall
use its reasonable efforts to obtain a written acknowledgement and waiver (in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to TriCo) from each holder of a
North Valley Option (i) confirming the number of North Valley Options held,
(ii) confirming that the treatment of such North Valley Options pursuant to
this Agreement and the amounts to be paid pursuant hereto have been correctly
calculated and (iii) containing waivers and/or such other matters as
reasonably determined by TriCo and shall provide a copy of each such
acknowledgement and waiver it has been able to obtain to TriCo at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, North Valley, the North Valley Board of
Directors and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of Section 6.16(a), (b) and (d).

 

(d) North Valley shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and
after the Effective Time neither TriCo nor the Surviving Corporation will be
required to deliver shares of TriCo Common Stock or North Valley Common Stock
or other capital stock to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of North
Valley Options after the Effective Time.

 

6.17. _Closing Financial Statements_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger, North Valley shall provide TriCo with North
Valleys consolidated financial statements presenting the financial condition
of North Valley and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the last
day of the last month ended prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and
North Valleys consolidated results of operations for the period from January
1, 2014 through the close of business on the last day of the last month ended
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (the " _Closing Financial
Statements_ "); _provided, however_ , that if the Effective Time of the Merger
occurs on or before the fifth Business Day of the month, North Valley shall
have provided consolidated financial statements as of and through the second
month preceding the Effective Time of the Merger. Such financial statements
shall be prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and
regulatory accounting principles and other applicable legal and accounting
requirements, and shall reflect all period-end accruals and other
adjustments, subject to the other requirements of this Agreement including the
final sentence of this Section 6.17. Such financial statements shall be
accompanied by a certificate of North Valleys Chief Financial Officer, dated
as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such financial statements
continue to reflect accurately, as of the date of the certificate, the
financial condition of North Valley in all material respects. Such Closing
Financial Statements shall also reflect accruals for all fees and expenses
incurred or expected to be incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement (whether or not doing so is in accordance with
GAAP) and shall be accompanied by a certificate of North Valleys Chief
Financial Officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such
financial statements meet the requirements of this Section 6.17.

 



60 6.18. _Customer Notices_. On and after the later of the date of receipt of all
Requisite Regulatory Approvals (disregarding any statutory waiting periods)
and the date of receipt of approval of the Merger by North Valley
shareholders, North Valley and North Valley Bank shall permit TriCo and Tri
Counties Bank to provide one or more written notices (which may be joint
notices from North Valley Bank and Tri Counties Bank) to customers of North
Valley and North Valley Bank describing the proposed Merger and the Bank
Merger, the effect on customers, planned transition procedures and similar
information. North Valley shall have the right to review and approve the
substance any such communications, provided that North Valley shall not
unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its approval.

 

6.19. _Professional Fees and Expenses_. North Valley shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause final bills (or estimated final bills through the
Effective Time) for all fees and expenses for services rendered by accounting,
investment banking, legal, tax and other advisors to North Valley to be
submitted to North Valley at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. North Valley shall pay all such final bills or estimated final
bills prior to the Effective Time; _provided,_ that any fees or expenses in
excess of such estimated final bills, or which result from services rendered
by any such advisors after the Effective Time, shall be submitted to TriCo in
a supplemental bill and promptly paid by TriCo upon receipt thereof.

6.20.  _Change in Control Payments_. North Valley shall pay, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, all amounts due and owing to North Valley
executive officers pursuant to a contract, arrangement, commitment, or
understanding between North Valley and each such executive officer including,
without limitation, severance and retirement payments under North Valley
salary continuation agreements (individually, a " _Change in Control Payment_
" and collectively, " _Change in Control Payments_ ").

Valley if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued
a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the

entered into by one or more shareholders of the party seeking to terminate;

(e) by North Valley (i) if TriCo shall have breached or failed to perform any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this

Outside Date and (ii) thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of written

however_ , that North Valley is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein;

 



66 (f) by TriCo, if:

 

(i) North Valley shall have breached or failed to perform any of its

being cured (or is not cured) by North Valley prior to the earlier of (i) the
Outside Date and (ii) thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of written

publicly proposes to do any of the foregoing, or (B) fails to comply with its
obligations under (x) Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) or (y) Section 6.7 or (z) fails
to include the North Valley Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement.

 

(g) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b),
(c), (d), (e) or (f) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with Section 9.4, specifying the
provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is affected.

 

8.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either TriCo or North
Valley as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect except Sections 6.2(b), 8.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8,
9.9, 9.10 and 9.12 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by TriCo pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(ii); or

 

(ii) (A) by (1) TriCo or North Valley pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or Section
8.1(d)(ii) (in the case of Section 8.1(c), only if at such time North Valley
has failed to hold the North Valley Shareholder Meeting and TriCo has obtained
the TriCo Requisite Vote and is not in breach of its obligations under Section
6.3) or (2) TriCo pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(i), and (B) a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed and not withdrawn
prior to the North Valley Shareholder Meeting (in the case of termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii)), prior to the termination date (in the case
of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)) or prior to the breach giving rise
to the right of termination (in the case of termination pursuant to Section
8.1(f)(i)), and (C) within fifteen (15) months after the termination of this
Agreement North Valley or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates the transactions contemplated by,
any Alternative Transaction, then North Valley shall pay TriCo a fee, in
immediately available funds, in the amount of $7,600,000 (the " _North Valley
Termination Fee_ ") (x) not later than two (2) Business Days following such
termination, in the case of a termination described in clause (b)(i) above,
or (y) at the time of the earlier of the entry into a definitive agreement
with respect to, or consummation of, the transaction contemplated by the
Alternative Transaction described in clause (b)(ii)(C) above, in the event of
a termination under the circumstances described in clause (b)(ii) above.

 



67 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by TriCo or North Valley
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(d)(i) (in the case of Section
8.1(c), only if at such time TriCo has failed to hold the TriCo Shareholder
Meeting and North Valley has obtained the North Valley Shareholder Approval
and is not in breach of its obligations under Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3),
then TriCo shall pay North Valley a fee, in immediately available funds, in
the amount of $3,800,000 (the " _TriCo Termination Fee_ ") not later than two
(2) Business Days following such termination. In no event shall TriCo be
required to pay the TriCo Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) North Valley and TriCo acknowledge that the agreements contained in
Sections 8.2(b) and 8.2(c) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
party would enter into this Agreement. The amounts payable by North Valley
pursuant to Section 8.2(b) hereof and the amounts payable by TriCo pursuant to
Section 8.2(c) hereof constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of North Valley and TriCo,
respectively, in the event of termination of this Agreement on the bases
specified in such sections (except for any liabilities or damages arising out
of fraud or willful and material breach of any provisions of this Agreement).
In the event that North Valley or TriCo fails to pay when due any amounts
payable under this Section 8.2, then (1) the party who fails to pay such
amounts shall reimburse the other party hereto for all costs and expenses
(including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in
connection with the collection of such overdue amount, and (2) the party who
fails to pay such amounts shall pay to the other party hereto interest on such
overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such
overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the
prime rate published in the New York edition of The Wall Street Journal on
the date such payment was required to be made.

8.3. _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized
by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval
of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of
TriCo and North Valley;  _provided, however_ , that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by North Valleys or TriCos
shareholders, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders,
any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form
of the consideration to be delivered to North Valley shareholders hereunder
other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

 



68 8.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be

the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting
the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.

9.11. _Publicity_. Except as otherwise required by Laws or the rules of NASDAQ
(or such other exchange on which the TriCo Common Stock or North Valleys
Common Stock may become listed), so long as this Agreement is in effect,

Subsidiaries or representatives or North Valleys Subsidiaries or
Representatives to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or

(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended
to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, and the covenants, undertakings and agreements set out herein shall
be solely for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable only by, the parties
