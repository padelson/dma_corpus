without limitation, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA
Patriot Act and all other applicable bank secrecy laws, fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices, except for those instances of noncompliance that are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on TriCo or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of TriCo to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, TriCo has not been
advised of any regulatory concerns regarding its compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act or related state or federal anti-money-laundering laws, regulations and guidelines, including those provisions of federal regulations requiring (i)&nbsp;the filing
of reports, such as Currency Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity Reports, (ii)&nbsp;the maintenance of records and (iii)&nbsp;the exercise of diligence in identifying customers. TriCo has adopted such procedures and policies as are necessary
or appropriate to comply with Title III of the USA Patriot Act and, to TriCo&#146;s Knowledge, TriCo is in compliance with such law in all material respects. Neither TriCo nor its Subsidiaries have received any notice in writing of any material
alleged or threatened claim, violation of or liability under any such Laws that has not heretofore been cured and for which there is any remaining liability. </P>

insurance policies in the mortgage files relating to the Loans secured by real property or are not material as to the collectability of such Loans; all Loans owned by TriCo and its Subsidiaries or in which TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries has an
interest are with full recourse to the borrowers, and neither TriCo nor its Subsidiaries have taken any action that would result in a waiver or negation of any rights or remedies available against the borrower or guarantor, if any, on any Loan,
other than in the ordinary course of business. To the Knowledge of TriCo, all applicable remedies against all borrowers and guarantors are enforceable except as such enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a
court of law or a court in equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, and similar Laws affecting creditors&#146; rights and remedies generally. All Loans sold by TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries have been sold without
recourse to TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries (other than with respect to customary representations and warranties) and without any liability under any yield maintenance or similar obligation. </P>
