Venture Interests; _provided, however_ , if Market Branson, LLC exercises its
right of first refusal, Branson Visitors TV, LLC will be an Excluded Asset;

 



 

(n) all intercompany debts, obligations and other contracts, leases,
agreements and arrangements among Schurz, Sellers or their Affiliates that are
not Purchased Contracts;

 



 

(o) all rights of Schurz and Sellers under this Agreement, including the
right to receive the Purchase Price (as defined below), under any agreement,
certificate, instrument or other document executed and delivered in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and under any side
agreement between Schurz or any Seller and Buyer entered into on or after the
date of this Agreement; and

 



 

(p) the assets listed on __Schedule __ _ _1.2(p)__ , if any.

 



 

1.3 _Assumption of Obligations._

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Closing,
each Seller shall assign to Buyer, and Buyer shall assume from each Seller
(and Buyer shall thereafter pay, perform, discharge or otherwise satisfy in
accordance with their respective terms) (i) subject to _Section 1.9_ , the
Multi-Station Contract Obligations and all liabilities and obligations of the
Business arising out of, or attributable to, any period of time after the
Effective Time, (ii) the obligations described in _Section 5.6_ , (iii) sales
commissions related to the sale of advertisements broadcast on the Stations in
accordance with the sales commission plans referenced in __Schedule 1.1(d)__
either arising out of or attributable to any period of time after the
Effective Time or constituting an Assumed Current Liability, (iv) all
obligations and liabilities under those Purchased Contracts that are assumed
pursuant to _Section 1.1(d)_ and the FCC Licenses, in each case, either
arising out of or attributable to any period of time after the Effective Time
or constituting an Assumed Current Liability, (v) any and all Taxes with
respect to Purchased Assets arising out of or attributable to any period of
time after the Effective Time, (vi) all other trade accounts payable of each
Seller to third parties in connection with the Business that constitute
Assumed Current Liabilities, (vii) all liabilities and obligations of each
Seller relating to compensation or other arrangements with respect to any
Employees that constitute Assumed Current Liabilities, and (viii) all other
obligations and liabilities arising out of or relating to Buyer's ownership
and operation of the Business and the Purchased Assets (collectively, the "
_Assumed Obligations_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Assumed Current
Liabilities_ " means only the current liabilities in the "Accounts Payable,"
"Accrued Expenses" and "Unexpired subscriptions and deposits" line items of a
balance sheet for the Stations, in each case as determined on a combined basis
for the Stations as of the Effective Time in accordance with GAAP and
consistent with the historical treatment of such line items the Financial
Statements for each Station and assuming that the Stations were operated in
the ordinary course of business between the date of the latest balance sheet
for each respective Station included in the Financial Statements and the
Effective Time; provided, that for purposes hereof "Group Insurance INBR"
shall be excluded from Accrued Expenses and Assumed Current Expenses. For the
avoidance of doubt, except for severance and other obligations and liabilities
assumed by Buyer under _Section 1.1(d)_ and _Section 5.6_ , stay bonuses,
severance and termination pay, and other compensation payable by any Seller in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not constitute Assumed Current Liabilities or Assumed
Obligations and shall be paid by each applicable Seller.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Except for the Assumed Obligations, Buyer does not assume, and will
not be deemed by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to have assumed, any
other liabilities or obligations of Schurz or any Seller or relating to the
Purchased Assets or the Business, of any kind or nature, whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise, or whether due or to become due, or
otherwise, whether known or unknown, arising out of events, transactions or
facts which shall have occurred, arisen or existed on or before the Effective
Time, which liabilities and obligations, if ever in existence, shall continue
to be liabilities and obligations of the applicable Seller, including any and
all liabilities and obligations of or on behalf of Seller for Taxes in respect
of taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Effective
Time and those relating to the Excluded Assets or for borrowed money,
including any liability of infringement, misappropriation or other conflict
with the Intellectual Property of any third party arising on or before the
Effective Time (the " _Retained Obligations_ "). Each applicable Seller shall
perform or otherwise discharge all Retained Obligations. For purposes of
clarity, and not in limitation of the foregoing, each applicable Seller or
Schurz shall be solely responsible for any forfeitures, fines and other
payments (collectively, " _Fines_ ") imposed by the FCC in connection with
such Seller's Business operations prior to the Closing Date, whether such
Fines are imposed by the FCC in connection with a Renewal Application (as
defined below) or otherwise and regardless of whether such Fines are imposed
before or after the Closing Date.

 



 

1.4 _Purchase Price_. In consideration for the sale of the Purchased
Assets, Buyer shall, at the Closing, in addition to assuming the Assumed
Obligations, pay to Schurz the sum of (i) Four Hundred Forty Two Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($442,500,000) (the " _Base Purchase Price_ "),
subject to adjustment as set forth on __Schedule 1.4(a)__ _,_ (ii) minus the
amount of the Employee Credit, and (iii) minus the amount, if any, of any QA
Payments actually received by any Seller (collectively, the " _Purchase Price_
"). The Purchase Price shall be paid at Closing as follows: (a) Buyer shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent; and
(b) the balance of the Purchase Price shall at Closing be paid by Buyer to
Schurz on behalf of Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with written instructions delivered by Schurz to Buyer prior to
Closing.

 



 

1.5 _Indemnity Escrow_. At the Closing, as provided in Section 1.4, Buyer
shall deliver the Escrow Amount to be retained in escrow with the Wells Fargo,
National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to the terms of that
certain escrow agreement in the form of Exhibit H attached hereto (the "
_Indemnity Escrow Agreement_ "). At Closing, Buyer and Schurz shall execute
and deliver the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Escrow Agent to execute and deliver the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Amount plus any interest or earnings thereon (the
"Indemnity Escrow") shall be a source of funds used to satisfy any amounts
owed by any Seller to Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 9.2 in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement. On the date after the expiration of the Survival Period, the
remaining Unclaimed Escrow Amount shall be released to Schurz. Any amount
remaining as Indemnity Escrow shall thereafter be released in accordance with
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 



 

1.6 _Allocation_. All amounts constituting consideration within the
meaning of and for the purposes of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the Treasury Regulations thereunder
shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets and any other rights acquired by
Buyer hereunder, as applicable, in the manner required by Section 1060 of the
Code. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare an
allocation of the Purchase Price and any Assumed Obligations for financial and
Tax reporting purposes in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of
state, local, or non-U.S. law as appropriate). Buyer and Schurz shall in good
faith use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to agree within one
hundred fifty (150) days after the Closing Date on such allocations for Tax
reporting purposes based upon a reasonable determination of the respective
fair market values of the Purchased Assets in accordance with the requirements
of the Code and the applicable Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder. To
the extent Buyer and Schurz so agree, then they shall complete and timely file
any necessary Tax forms, and their respective income Tax Returns, in
accordance with such allocation. If Buyer and Schurz are unable to agree on
such allocation within such one hundred fifty (150) day period, then Buyer and
Schurz shall have no further obligations pursuant to this Section 1.6, and
each of Buyer and Schurz shall make its own determination of such allocation
for financial and tax reporting purposes.

 



 

1.7 _Closing._

 



 

(a) Subject to any prior termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section _ _10.1_ , the consummation of the sale and purchase of the
Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement and the assumption of the Assumed
Obligations (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Cooley LLP,
1299 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Suite 700, Washington, D.C. 20004 on the fifth
(5th) Business Day after the latest of (i) the date upon which the FCC Consent
(as defined below) shall have been granted and shall be in full force and
effect and, solely if any petitions to deny or other informal objections have
been filed by any person with respect to the FCC Applications, shall have
become a Final Order (as defined below), and (ii) the date the HSR Clearance
(as defined below) occurs, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to Closing set forth herein, or on such other date or at such other
location as is mutually agreeable to Buyer and Schurz; _provided_ , _however_
, that, in the event of any petitions to deny or other informal objections
have been filed by any person with respect to the FCC Applications, Buyer in
its sole discretion and upon at least ten (10) days prior written notice to
Schurz may waive the requirement that the FCC Consent become a Final Order, in
which event, the date described in clause (i) above will be the date upon
which public notice of the grant of the FCC Consent is made by the FCC;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended on the
last date the Closing shall be required to occur pursuant to the foregoing,
the Closing shall not occur until the earlier to occur of (1) a date during
the Marketing Period specified by the Buyer on no fewer than three (3)
Business Days prior notice to Schurz and (2) the third (3rd) Business Day
immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period (subject in each
case to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
Article 6 and Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions at the Closing) as of the date determined pursuant to this
proviso). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Order_ " means an action by
the FCC (x) that has not been vacated, reversed, stayed, enjoined, set aside,
annulled or suspended; (y) with respect to which no request for stay, motion
or petition for rehearing, reconsideration or review, or application or
request for review or notice of appeal or sua sponte review by the FCC is
pending; and (z) as to which the time for filing any such request, motion,
petition, application, appeal or notice, and for the entry of orders staying,
reconsidering or reviewing on the FCC's own motion has expired.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_ " and, in respect of each Station, 12:01 a.m., local time, for
such Station on the Closing Date is referred to herein as the " _Effective
Time_ "; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to those certain Purchased
Contracts relating to advertising time on the Stations, the Effective Time
shall be deemed to be 5:00 a.m., local time, on the Closing Date.

 



 

1.8 _Governmental Consents._

 



 

(a) Within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer
and each applicable Seller shall file applications with the FCC (collectively,
the " _FCC Application_ ") requesting FCC consent to the assignment of the FCC
Licenses to Buyer. FCC consent to the FCC Application with respect to those
FCC Licenses set forth on __Schedule 1.8(a)__ , including (1) FCC consent to
the continuing satellite waivers or main studio waivers for KBSD-DT, KBSL-DT,
KBSH-DT, KHSD-TV, KDUH-TV and KSGW-TV or a determination that no such waivers
are required, (2) FCC consent to the waiver of the FCC's local television
ownership rule, 47 C.F.R. § 73.3555(b), and any other FCC rule, policy, or
guideline to permit the assignment to Buyer of the FCC Licenses and the joint
sales agreements currently in place in Wichita, Kansas and Springfield,
Missouri following the Closing until at least December 31, 2016, (3) FCC
consent to the waiver of the FCC's local television ownership rule, 47 C.F.R.
§ 73.3555(b), and any other FCC rule, policy, or guideline to permit the
assignment to Buyer of the FCC Licenses in the Augusta, Georgia market, and
(4) FCC consent to the waiver of the FCC's local television ownership rule, 47
C.F.R. § 73.3555(b) to permit the assignment to Buyer of the license for KSCW-
DT, Wichita, Kansas, in each case of (1), (2), (3) and (4), without any
material adverse conditions other than those of general applicability is
referred to herein as the " _FCC Consent_." Buyer and each applicable Seller
shall diligently prosecute the FCC Application and otherwise use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as soon as possible;
_provided_ , _however_ , except as provided in the following sentence, neither
Buyer, Schurz, nor shall any Seller be required to pay consideration to any
third party to obtain FCC Consent.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall pay one-half (1/2) and Schurz shall pay one-half (1/2) of
the FCC filing fees relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
irrespective of whether the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated. Buyer and each applicable Seller each shall oppose any petitions
to deny or other objections filed with respect to the FCC Application to the
extent such petition or objection relates to such party or Person. Neither
Buyer nor any Seller shall take any intentional action that would, or
intentionally fail to take such action the failure of which to take would,
reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially delaying the receipt
of the FCC Consent. If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason
within the original effective period of the FCC Consent, and neither party
shall have terminated this Agreement under _Section_ _10.1_ , Buyer and each
applicable Seller shall jointly request one or more extensions of the
effective period of the FCC Consent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
extension of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of either party to exercise
such party's rights under _Section_ _10.1_.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) The " _Primary FCC Licenses_ " shall mean those FCC Licenses set forth
in __Schedule 1.8(c)__. The Primary FCC Licenses of the Stations expire on the
dates set forth in __Schedule 1.1(c)__ _._ If, at any point prior to Closing,
an application for the renewal of any Primary FCC License (a " _Renewal
Application_ ") is either pending or must be filed pursuant to the
Communications Laws, the applicable Seller shall timely execute, file and
prosecute with the FCC such Renewal Application in accordance with _Section _
_4.1(b)_ hereof. If the FCC Application is granted by the FCC subject to a
renewal condition, then, notwithstanding any limitation in this _Section_
_1.8_ , the applicable Seller's satisfaction of such renewal condition shall
be deemed a precondition to obtaining the FCC Consent and Governmental
Consent. For each Renewal Application that is pending on the date hereof or
that must be filed during the pendency of the FCC Application, Buyer agrees to
request that the FCC apply its policy permitting the transfer of control of
Primary FCC Licenses in transactions involving multiple stations to proceed,
notwithstanding the pendency of one or more Renewal Applications (the " _FCC
Renewal Policy_ "). Buyer shall make such representations and agree to such
undertakings as are required to be made in order to invoke the FCC Renewal
Policy, including undertakings to assume, as between the parties and the FCC,
the position of the applicant before the FCC with respect to any pending
Renewal Application and to assume the corresponding regulatory risks relating
to any such Renewal Application; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing set
forth in this _Section_ _1.8(c)_ shall be deemed to amend or modify the
provisions of _Section_ _1.3_ relating to the Retained Obligations and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 hereof, the
applicable Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any forfeiture or other penalty
that Buyer may incur due to an FCC determination as to such Seller's operation
of that Station. In addition, should it be necessary to avoid disruption or
delay in the processing of the FCC Application despite the forgoing, the
applicable Seller shall, to the extent reasonably necessary to expedite grant
by the FCC of that Renewal Application and thereby to facilitate grant of the
FCC Application, promptly enter into a tolling, assignment and assumption or
similar agreement (a " _Tolling Agreement_ ") with the FCC to facilitate grant
of any Renewal Application, to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC
to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against that Station in connection
with (i) any pending complaints that the Station aired programming that
contained obscene, indecent or profane material or (ii) any other enforcement
matters against the Station with respect to which the FCC may permit such
Seller to enter into a tolling assignment and assumption or similar agreement,
and such Seller shall comply with such Tolling Agreement(s). To the extent
that it may be required by the FCC, Buyer agrees to become a party to and
execute such a Tolling Agreement subject to the condition that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Schurz
shall indemnify Buyer for any forfeiture or other penalty that Buyer may incur
due to an FCC determination as to the applicable Seller's operation of that
Station. Buyer and Schurz shall consult in good faith with each other prior to
any Seller entering into any such Tolling Agreement under this _Section_
_1.8(c)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to enter
into any Tolling Agreement or agree to fund any Tolling Agreement escrow.

 



 

(d) Within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer
and Schurz shall make any required filings with the Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")
pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby (including a request for early termination of the waiting period
thereunder), and Buyer and Schurz shall thereafter promptly use commercially
reasonable efforts to respond to all requests received from such agencies for
additional information or documentation. Expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is referred to herein as the "
_HSR Clearance_." Buyer shall pay one-half (1/2) and Seller shall pay one-half
(1/2) of the HSR filing fees relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
irrespective of whether the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and in
addition to the other covenants set forth in this Agreement, Buyer agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents under any antitrust
or competition Legal Requirement, rule or regulation (including the HSR Act)
or Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules, regulations and
written policies of the FCC promulgated pursuant thereto (the "
_Communications Laws_ ") that may be required by the FCC, the FTC, the DOJ,
any state Attorney General or any other U.S. federal, state or local
Governmental Entity, or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition
Governmental Entity, in each case having competent jurisdiction, so as to
enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable.

 



 

(f) In connection with their obligations pursuant to this _Section _
_1.8_ with respect to pursuing the FCC Consent and the HSR Clearance, Buyer
and Schurz shall, subject to applicable Legal Requirements and confidentiality
obligations (i) keep each other informed in all material respects and on a
reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any governmental agency and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any Action by a private
party, in each case with respect to this Agreement, the Stations, the Business
or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) notify each other of all
documents filed with or received from any governmental agency with respect to
this Agreement, the Stations, the Business or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) furnish each other with such information and assistance as the
other may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of any
governmental filing hereunder and (iv) cooperate in all reasonable respects
with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
governmental agency in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or
before any governmental agency relating to this Agreement, the Stations, the
Business or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any Action
initiated by a private party. The FCC Consent and HSR Clearance are referred
to herein collectively as the " _Governmental Consents_ ". Subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information and any existing
confidentiality obligations, each of Buyer and Schurz shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the
other on all information relating to the other party or parties, as the case
may be, and their respective Affiliates, that both appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
governmental agency and relates to the parties' obtaining the Governmental
Consents with respect to this Agreement, the Stations, the Business or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 



   



 

(g) In addition to, and not in limitation of, any other provision of this
Agreement, if at any time following the execution of this Agreement, Buyer is
not qualified under applicable Law to acquire attributable interests in any
FCC Licenses included in the Purchased Assets associated with the TV Stations
listed on __Schedule 1.8(g)__ (such FCC Licenses, the " _Overlap Licenses_ "),
then Buyer shall elect one or more of the following with respect to the
Overlap Licenses: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) promptly
enter into a purchase agreement (or other similar agreement) no later than the
forty-fifth (45th) Business Day following execution of this Agreement with one
or more third parties that is or are so qualified to acquire such Overlap
Licenses and such other Purchased Assets as Buyer elects to include in such
transaction and (B) cause such third party or parties to purchase such Overlap
Licenses concurrently with the Closing; and/or (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) promptly enter into a purchase agreement (or other
similar agreement) no later than the forty-fifth (45th) Business Day following
execution of this Agreement with one or more third parties to acquire such
assets currently owned by Buyer such that Buyer would become qualified under
applicable Legal Requirement to acquire attributable interests in any Overlap
Licenses in such market and (B) cause such third party or parties to purchase
such divested assets concurrently with the Closing. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, no assignment contemplated by this _Section_
_1.8_ shall relieve Buyer of its obligation to consummate the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or to pay the entire Purchase Price at the
Closing. With respect to the Overlap Licenses, Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take all actions required, and comply with all
conditions imposed on it, in order to obtain the FCC Consent and HSR Clearance
with respect to the Overlap Licenses, including, but not limited to, any
requirement that Buyer utilize an FCC divestiture trust in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions at the Closing to the extent related to such
Overlap Stations. Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all Taxes and
other costs and expenses, including filing fees, incurred in connection with
or as a result of the asset purchase agreement and any divesture trust or
other similar structure or transaction.

 



 

(h) Buyer and Schurz will reasonably cooperate with and assist each other
in connection with the foregoing, will comply with their obligations set forth
on __Schedule 1.8(h)__ , and will use commercially reasonable efforts to
undertake their obligations under this _Section_ _1.8_ _8_ in a manner that
shall not materially delay or otherwise impair the receipt of the applicable
FCC Consent, HSR Clearance or the consummation of the transactions hereunder.

 



 

1.9 _Multi-Station Contracts._ For purposes of this Agreement, _" Multi-
Station Contract_" means any contract, agreement or lease used in the Business
that one or more Other Schurz Business is party to, or has rights or
obligations with respect to, and " _Material Multi-Station Contract_ " means
any Multi-Station Contract for which (a) the obligations under such contract,
agreement or lease require payment by a Seller in excess of One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000) annually, or (b) the rights under such contract,
agreement or lease entitle a Seller to receive in excess of One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000) annually. _Schedule 1.9_ includes a list, as of
the date hereof, of the Material Multi-Station Contracts. The rights and
obligations under each Multi-Station Contract that is assigned to and assumed
by Buyer (and included in the Purchased Assets and Assumed Obligations, as the
case may be) shall include only those rights and obligations under such Multi-
Station Contract to the extent that they are applicable to the Stations. The
rights of each Other Schurz Business with respect to such Multi-Station
Contract and the obligations of each Other Schurz Business to such Multi-
Station Contract shall not be assigned to and assumed by Buyer (and shall be
Excluded Assets and Retained Obligations, as the case may be). Subject to the
provisions of this _Section 1.9_ , the Purchased Assets shall include those
rights to the extent relating to the Business which are attributable to the
period from and after the Effective Time under a Multi-Station Contract,
subject to the terms and conditions of such Multi-Station Contract (such
rights, the "Multi-Station Contract Rights"), and the Assumed Obligations
shall include both those obligations assumed under _Section 1.3(a)(vi)_ and
those obligations to the extent relating to the Business which are
attributable to the period from and after the Effective Time under a Multi-
Station Contract, subject to the terms and conditions of each such Multi-
Station Contract (such obligations, the " _Multi-Station Contract Obligations_
"). All rights and obligations which arise under a Multi-Station Contract
other than the Multi-Station Contract Rights and the Multi-Station Contract
Obligations shall in all cases be included in the Excluded Assets and the
Retained Obligations, as applicable. For purposes of determining the scope of
the Multi-Station Contract Rights and the Multi-Station Contract Obligations,
the rights and obligations under each Multi-Station Contract shall be
equitably allocated among (1) the Stations, on the one hand, and (2) the Other
Schurz Business, on the other hand, in accordance with the following equitable
allocation principles:

 



 

 



   



 

(a) any allocation set forth in the Multi-Station Contract shall control;

 



 

(b) except as set forth on __Schedule 1.9(b)__ , if there is no allocation
in the Multi-Station Contract as described in clause (a) hereof, then any
reasonable allocation previously made by Schurz or its Affiliates (as
applicable) in the ordinary course of business or consistent with Schurz's or
its Affiliates' (as applicable) historical expense allocation of such Multi-
Station Contract shall control;

 



 

(c) if there is no reasonable allocation as described in clause (b)
hereof, then the quantifiable proportionate benefit to be received by Schurz
and Buyer after the Effective Time (to be determined by mutual good faith
agreement of Schurz and Buyer) shall control; and

 



 

(d) if not quantifiable as described in clause (c) hereof, then reasonable
accommodation (to be determined by mutual good faith agreement of Schurz and
Buyer) shall control.

 



 

Subject to any applicable third-party consents, authorizations, approvals,
waivers or notices, such allocation shall be effectuated, at the election of
Schurz, by termination of the Multi-Station Contract in its entirety and the
execution of new contracts on substantially the same terms and conditions as
the terminated Multi-Station Contract or by an assignment to and assumption by
Buyer of the Multi-Station Contract Rights and the Multi-Station Contract
Obligations under such Multi-Station Contract. The parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such new contracts or
assignments to, and assumptions by, Buyer in accordance with this _Section_
_1.9_ _1.9_ and _Section_ _5.5_. Schurz shall keep Buyer reasonably informed
and shall consult with Buyer in good faith in making any determinations
described in this paragraph.

execution, delivery and performance by Schurz and each Seller of this
Agreement and the Seller Ancillary Agreements and the consummation by Schurz
and Sellers of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby does not
and will not, in any material respect, conflict with, violate, result in a

Article 3 
BUYER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 



 

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules, Buyer hereby makes the
following representations and warranties to Schurz and Sellers:

 



 

3.1 _Organization_ _._ Buyer is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Buyer
has the requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this
Agreement and all of the other agreements and instruments to be executed and
delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto (collectively, the "Buyer Ancillary
Agreements") and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

3.2 _Authorization_ _._ The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by Buyer have been duly
authorized and approved by all necessary action of Buyer and its directors,
officers and stockholders and do not require any further authorization or
consent of Buyer or its directors, officers or stockholders. This Agreement
is, and each Buyer Ancillary Agreement when executed and delivered by Buyer
and the other parties thereto will be, a legal, valid and binding agreement of
Buyer enforceable in accordance with its terms, except in each case as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, moratorium, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws affecting or limiting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and except as such enforceability is subject to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

3.3 _No Conflicts_ _._ Except for the Governmental Consents, the
execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the Buyer
Ancillary Agreements and the consummation by Buyer of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby does not and will not conflict with, violate,
result in a breach of the terms and conditions of, or, with or without notice
or the passage of time, result in any breach, event of default or the creation
of any lien under, any lease, contract or agreement to which Buyer is a party
or to which its assets are subject, any organizational documents of Buyer, or
any law, judgment, order or decree to which Buyer is subject, or require the
consent or approval of, or a filing by Buyer with, any governmental or
regulatory authority or any third party (other than required filings with the
FCC and SEC).

 



 

 



   



 

3.4 _Litigation_ _._ There is no Action pending or, to Buyer's Knowledge,
threatened against Buyer which would reasonably be expected to affect Buyer's
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise impede,
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. "Knowledge" with respect to Buyer shall mean the actual
knowledge of Kevin Latek and Jim Ryan of Buyer.

 



 

3.5 _Qualification._ Except as set forth on __Schedule 3.5__ , Buyer is
legally, financially and otherwise qualified to be the licensee of, acquire,
own and operate the Stations under the Communications Laws. Buyer is in
compliance with Section 310(b) of the Communications Laws and the FCC's rules
governing alien ownership. Except as set forth on __Schedule 3.__ _5_ , there
are no facts or circumstances that would, under the Communications Laws and
the existing procedures of the FCC, disqualify Buyer as an assignee of the FCC
Licenses or as the owner and operator of the Stations. No waiver of or
exemption from any provision of the Communications Laws and policies of the
FCC is necessary for the FCC Consent to be obtained. To Buyer's Knowledge,
except as set forth on __Schedule 3.5__ , there are no facts or circumstances
relating to Buyer that might reasonably be expected to (a) result in the FCC's
refusal to grant the FCC Consent or otherwise disqualify Buyer, (b) materially
delay obtaining the FCC Consent or (c) cause the FCC to impose a material
condition or conditions on its granting of the FCC Consent.

 



 

3.6 _Financing._ Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obligation of
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
conditioned upon Buyer's ability to finance or pay the Purchase Price and
that, if all of the conditions set forth in Article 7 are satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature would be satisfied at the Closing)
and this Agreement has not been previously terminated, any failure of Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the Closing as a
result of the failure to pay the Purchase Price shall constitute a material
breach by Buyer of this Agreement giving rise to Schurz's right to terminate
this Agreement under _Section_ _10.1(c)_ hereof. Buyer has funds on hand
sufficient to enable Buyer to pay the Business Disruption Termination Fee, if
so required.

 



 

3.7 _Solvency._ Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions in
Article 7 hereof, and (b) the accuracy in all material respects of the
representations and warranties of Schurz and Sellers set forth in Article 2
hereof, then immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including any financing, any other repayment or refinancing
of debt contemplated in this Agreement, payment of all amounts required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and payment of all related fees and expenses, Buyer shall be Solvent
(as defined below). For purposes of this Agreement: (i) "Solvent", when used
with respect to Buyer, means that, as of any date of determination, (A) the
Present Fair Salable Value (as defined below) of its assets will, as of such
date, exceed all of its liabilities, contingent or otherwise, as of such date,
(B) Buyer will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the business in which it is engaged or will be engaged and (C)
Buyer will be able to pay its debts as they become absolute and mature, in the
ordinary course of business, taking into account the timing of and amounts of
cash to be received by it and the timing of and amounts of cash to be payable
on or in respect of its indebtedness, in each case after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the term "Solvency" shall
have a correlative meaning; (ii) "debt" means liability on a "claim"; (iii)
"claim" for purposes of this _Section _ _3.7_ means (A) any right to payment,
whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or
unsecured or (B) the right to an equitable remedy for a breach in performance
if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such equitable
remedy is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or
unsecured; and (iv) "Present Fair Salable Value" means the amount that may be
realized if the aggregate assets of Buyer (including goodwill) are sold as an
entirety with reasonable promptness in an arm's-length transaction under
present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises.

 



 

 



   



 

3.8 _Brokers_ _._ Except for services of Wells Fargo Securities to Buyer,
for which the applicable fee shall be paid by Buyer, no broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other third party has been employed or retained
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or is or may be entitled to any broker's,
finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission, or the
reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates.

 



 

3.9 _Securities Laws_ _._ Buyer is an "accredited investor" within the
meaning of regulation D of the Securities Act, with such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters as are necessary in order to
evaluate the merits and risks in an investment in the Business Joint Venture
Interests. The Business Joint Venture Interests to be acquired by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement shall be acquired for Buyer's own account and not
with a view to, or intention of, distribution thereof in violation of the
Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws. Buyer is able to bear
the economic risk of its investment in the Business Joint Venture Interests
for an indefinite period of time and acknowledges that the Business Joint
Venture Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act and,
therefore, cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities
Act or an exemption from such registration is available.

 



 

3.10 _Projections and Other Information_ _._ Buyer acknowledges that,
with respect to any estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans, budget
information and similar documentation or information relating to the Sellers,
the Stations, the Business and the transactions contemplated hereby that Buyer
has received from Schurz, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or
advisors and that is not expressly set forth in this Agreement, (a) Buyer is
not relying on such documentation in making its determination with respect to
signing this Agreement or completing the transactions contemplated hereby, (b)
there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, and Buyer is familiar with such
uncertainties, (c) Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to it, and (d) Buyer does not have,
and will not assert, any claim against Schurz, the Sellers, their respective
Affiliates or any of its or any of their respective directors, officers,
members, managers, employees, Affiliates or representatives, or hold Schurz,
the Sellers or any such Persons liable, with respect thereto. None of Schurz,
the Sellers, any of their respective Affiliates nor any other Person will have
or be subject to any liability to Buyer or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to Buyer or its representatives or Buyer's use of, any such
information, including any confidential memoranda distributed on behalf of
Schurz or the Sellers relating to the Purchased Assets or other publications
or data room information provided to Buyer or its representatives _._

Article 5 
JOINT COVENANTS

 



 

Schurz, Sellers and Buyer hereby covenant and agree as follows:

 



 

 



   



 

5.1 _Confidentiality._

 



 

(a) Schurz and Buyer (or an Affiliate of Buyer) are parties to a
nondisclosure agreement (the " _NDA_ ") with respect to Sellers and the
Stations. To the extent not already a direct party thereto, Buyer hereby
assumes the NDA and agrees to be bound by the provisions thereof applicable to
its Affiliate which is a party thereto and such NDA shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the NDA remains
in full force and effect and, in addition, covenants and agrees to keep
confidential, in accordance with the provisions of the NDA, information
provided to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the NDA and the provisions of this
_Section_ _5.1_ _(a)_ shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the NDA, Buyer's
obligations under the NDA with respect to Purchased Assets and the Business
shall terminate upon the Closing.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing for a period of two (2) years, Schurz and
Sellers shall: (i) treat and hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide
access to any Person to) all Confidential Information (as defined in the NDA),
(ii) in the event that Schurz or any Seller or any of its representatives
becomes legally compelled to disclose any such information, provide Buyer with
prompt written notice of such requirement so that Buyer may seek a protective
order or other remedy or waive compliance with this _Section_ _5.1(b)_ , (iii)
in the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or
Buyer waives compliance with this _Section_ _5.1(b)_ , furnish only that
portion of such confidential information which, on the advice of counsel, is
legally required to be provided and, at Buyer's expense, exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be
accorded such information; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall
not apply to any information that, at the time of disclosure, is available
publicly and was not disclosed in breach of this Agreement by Schurz or
Sellers and shall not in any way limit Schurz or any Seller's ability to use
any such information in connection with any dispute between Buyer and Schurz
or Sellers.

 



 

5.2 _Announcements._ Prior to the Closing, no party shall, without the
prior written consent of the other, issue any press release or make any other
public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except to the extent that such party is so obligated by law or any
rule or regulation of any securities exchange upon which the securities of
such party are listed or traded, in which case such party shall give advance
notice to the other, and except that the parties shall cooperate to make a
mutually agreeable announcement.

 



 

5.3 _Control._ Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, control, supervise or
direct the business or operations of the Business prior to Closing. Consistent
with the Communications Laws, control, supervision and direction of the
operation of the Business prior to Closing shall remain the responsibility of
the respective FCC Licensees as the holders of the FCC Licenses.

 



 

5.4 _Risk of Loss._

 



 

(a) Sellers shall bear the risk of any loss of or damage to any of the
Purchased Assets at all times from the date hereof until the Effective Time.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) In furtherance thereof, if after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time any material Purchased Asset is lost, damaged or destroyed or
otherwise not in the condition described in _Section 2.6_ or _Section 2.7_ ,
as applicable, then (i) the applicable Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of
such loss, damage or destruction of such material Purchased Asset, which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such loss, damage or
destruction, the cause thereof (if known or reasonably ascertainable) and the
insurance coverage, if any, available with respect to such lost, damaged or
destroyed material Purchased Asset, and (ii) such Seller shall repair or
replace such material Purchased Asset, including by submitting one or more
claims under any applicable insurance policy maintained by such Seller with
respect to such lost, damaged or destroyed material Purchased Asset.

 



 

5.5 _Consents and Other Arrangements._

 



 

(a) The parties shall, and Schurz shall cause each Seller to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) any third party consents
necessary for the assignment of any Purchased Contract to Buyer (which shall
not require any payment to any such third party), and (ii) estoppel
certificates reasonably acceptable to Buyer from lessors under any Real
Property Leases, but no such third party consents or estoppel certificates are
conditions to Closing except for those with respect to the Material Contracts
identified on __Schedule 5.5(a)__ (the " _Required Consents_ ").

 



 

(b) To the extent that any Purchased Contract may not be assigned without
the consent of any third party, and such consent is not obtained prior to
Closing, this Agreement and any assignment executed pursuant to this Agreement
shall not constitute an assignment of such Purchased Contract; _provided_ ,
_however_ , with respect to each such Purchased Contract, the applicable
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to the extent feasible in effecting a lawful
and commercially reasonable arrangement under which Buyer shall receive the
benefits under the Purchased Contract from and after Closing, and to the
extent of the benefits received, Buyer shall pay and perform the applicable
Seller's obligations arising under the Purchased Contract from and after
Closing in accordance with its terms and indemnify and hold harmless each
Seller and its Affiliates for any costs, expenses or liabilities (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by them in connection with the
enforcement of such Purchased Contract as it relates to any period after the
Effective Time, and Buyer and Sellers shall continue to use reasonable efforts
for a reasonable period of time after Closing (not to exceed six (6) months)
to obtain consents to assign such Purchased Contracts.

 



 

5.6 _Employee Relations._

 



 

(a) Buyer shall offer employment in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 5.6 to all Employees effective as of the Closing Date (provided such
Employee is employed as of such date) on substantially the same terms as in
effect for each such Employee immediately prior to Closing. Such offers of
employment pursuant to the preceding sentence to the Employees who are not on
short-term or long-term disability shall be made not later than ten (10)
calendar days prior to the Closing Date and must remain outstanding for at
least five (5) business days but in no event later than the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the offers of employment to any Employee who is
covered by a written employment agreement shall be made in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in the applicable employment agreement. Buyer's
offer of employment to each Employee on short-term or long-term disability who
is not actively employed as of the Closing Date shall be made promptly when
such Employee is eligible to return to active service at any time within the
six-month period following the Closing Date, or if longer, during the period
Employee has a right to re-employment under applicable law. Employees whose
employment with each applicable Seller terminates and who accept or are
treated by Buyer as accepting such offers of employment by and actually
commence employment with Buyer (or its Affiliates) in accordance with this
Section 5.6 are referred to collectively herein as the " _Transferred
Employees_." Unless otherwise provided under the terms of a written employment
contract, each Transferred Employee shall be employed by Buyer on an at will
basis and nothing shall prohibit Buyer from terminating the employment of any
such Transferred Employees at any time after the Closing Date or changing any
of the terms and conditions of employment related to such Transferred
Employees at any time, except for such changes that are inconsistent with
Buyer's obligations as set forth in this _Section 5.6_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Transferred Employee terminated by Buyer shall be eligible for
severance in accordance with the terms of Buyer's existing severance plans,
policies or practices. Service with the applicable Seller shall be deemed
service with Buyer for purposes of determining the amount of any such
severance.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) In the case of each Transferred Employee under a written employment
contract, Buyer shall assume each Seller's obligations under such employment
contract as of the applicable effective date of their employment with Buyer
arising out of or attributable to any period of time after the Effective Date
or constituting an Assumed Current Liability. For the avoidance of doubt,
without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall not assume any written employment
agreement, nor owe any obligation to, any Employee who is not a Transferred
Employee.

 



 

(c) If any Employee to whom Buyer has offered employment in accordance
with this Section 5.6 does not consent to employment with Buyer or for any
other reason (other than rescission of such offer by Buyer) does not commence
employment with Buyer and severance benefits are owed to such employee as a
result, such severance benefits shall be paid by the applicable Seller.
Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Schurz from offering or paying
performance and stay bonuses and other compensation payable solely by Schurz
or Sellers in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Except with respect to Buyer's 401(k) plan, Buyer shall permit
Transferred Employees (and their spouses and dependents) to participate in its
"employee welfare benefit plans" (including without limitation health
insurance plans) in which similarly situated employees of Buyer are generally
eligible to participate, with coverage effective immediately on the applicable
effective date of their employment with Buyer (and without exclusion from
coverage on account of any pre-existing condition except to the extent such
persons were subject to such pre-existing condition limitations under Seller's
group health plan); provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, there shall be
no participation of any Transferred Employee in Buyer's pension plan.
Transferred Employees' service with any Seller (and any predecessors of any
Seller to the extent credited with service by such Seller) will be deemed as
service with Buyer for purposes of eligibility, waiting periods, vesting
periods (but not benefit accrual) based on length of service for purposes of
all of Buyer's employee benefit plans, including Buyer's 401(k) plan, and
calculation of vacation and severance benefits, if applicable. Buyer agrees
to give credit under its group health plan to the Transferred Employees who do
not elect COBRA under the Schurz or applicable Seller's group health plan for
the deductible and coinsurance amounts incurred by the Transferred Employees
during the calendar year under the Schurz or applicable Seller's group health
plan subject to receipt by Buyer of reasonable documentation with respect to
such amounts. To the extent reasonably administratively feasible and subject
to applicable law, Buyer also agrees to cover under its health flexible
spending account program those Transferred Employees who have elected to
participate in the health flexible spending account under the cafeteria plan
maintained by Schurz or any applicable Seller, and who do not elect COBRA
coverage under the Schurz or applicable Seller's health flexible spending
account, with the same level of coverage provided under the Schurz or
applicable Seller's health flexible spending account and to treat such
Transferred Employees as if their participation had been continuous from the
beginning of Schurz or applicable Seller's plan year. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that the Closing Date
occurs prior to December 31, 2015, (i) Buyer may elect, and Schurz and each
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer's efforts, to
continue in place one or more of Seller's "employee welfare benefit plans"
(including without limitation health insurance plans) until December 31, 2015
at no financial cost to Schurz or any Seller (such costs to be promptly
reimbursed by Buyer) with respect to the period after the Closing, and (ii)
Buyer's obligations with respect to participation in its plans under this
Section 5.6(d) shall commence January 1, 2016.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) In the event Schurz's 401(k) plan incurs a partial plan termination
due to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or if otherwise
required by such plan, effective as of the applicable effective date of their
employment with Buyer or the payroll period ending immediately thereafter,
Schurz or each Seller shall have contributed to Schurz's 401(k) plan all
matching or other employer contributions, if any, with respect to the
Transferred Employees' employment service rendered prior to the applicable
effective date of their employment with Buyer (irrespective of any end-of-year
service requirements otherwise applicable to such contributions) and cause the
matching and other employer contribution amounts of all Transferred Employees
under the Schurz 401(k) Plan to become fully vested as of such date. Following
the Closing Date, Schurz or each applicable Seller shall take all actions
necessary or appropriate to ensure that under the terms of the Seller 401(k)
plan, each Transferred Employee with an account balance is eligible to receive
a distribution as a result of their separation from employment with the
applicable Seller as of the applicable effective date of their employment with
Buyer. From and after the applicable effective date of their employment with
Buyer, Buyer shall permit each Transferred Employee who participates in
Seller's 401(k) plan to elect to make direct rollovers of their account
balances (including any outstanding loan balances; provided such Transferred
Employee elects to make a direct rollover of their entire vested account
balance) into Buyer's 401(k) plan as of the applicable effective date of their
employment with Buyer (or as soon as practicable thereafter when Buyer's
401(k) plan is capable of accepting such rollovers), subject to compliance
with applicable law and subject to the reasonable requirements of Buyer's
401(k) plan. Transferred Employees shall be eligible to otherwise participate
in Buyer's 401(k) plan as of the first date of the first full month after
Closing, and the Closing Date shall be deemed the Transferred Employees hire
date for the determination of any benefit or eligibility under Buyer's 401(k)
plan.

 



 

 



   



 

(f) Buyer shall provide to each Transferred Employee credit for any unused
paid time off (or sick and vacation) (calculated as of the Closing Date) that
was accrued in calendar year 2015 in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the
amount calculated pursuant to the applicable Seller's policies as in effect on
the date of this Agreement excluding any hours credited and not earned by such
date, and (ii) 75% of Buyer's PTO Cap (as defined below) (giving the
Transferred Employees credit for service with the applicable Seller to the
same extent such service was credited to such Transferred Employee by such
Seller for similar purposes). For purposes hereof, " _Buyer 's PTO Cap_" means
(a) for any Transferred Employee with less than 8 years of service with any
applicable Seller, 120 hours, (b) for any Transferred Employee with between 8
years and 15 years of service with any applicable Seller, 160 hours and (c)
for any Transferred Employee with more than 15 years of service with any
applicable Seller, 200 hours. The total amount of the credits given by Buyer
will reduce the Purchase Price dollar-for-dollar (such credit amounts, the "
_Employee Credit_ "). If the amount calculated pursuant to clause (i) above is
greater than the amount calculated pursuant to clause (ii) above with respect
to any Transferred Employee and if such difference is required to be paid,
each applicable Seller shall be solely responsible as a Retained Obligation
for the amount of such difference with respect to the Transferred Employees,
and Buyer shall not be responsible for any portion of such liability. If the
applicable laws of any State mandate, in the circumstances of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that any Transferred Employee be paid cash in
lieu of a credit in respect of any unused vacation leave, or mandate that any
Transferred Employee be given a choice of cash payment in lieu of a credit in
respect of any unused vacation leave, each applicable Seller shall make a cash
payment to any such Transferred Employee who is so entitled to receive (or
elects to receive) a cash payment in accordance with applicable law.

 



 

(g) All workers' compensation obligations relating to, arising out of or
resulting from any claim by any Employee that results from an injury that
occurred prior to the applicable effective date of their employment with Buyer
shall be retained by each applicable Seller. All workers' compensation
obligations relating to, arising out of or resulting from any claim by a
Transferred Employee that results from an injury that occurs after the
applicable effective date of their employment with Buyer shall be the
exclusive responsibility of the Buyer. Each Seller further agrees that (i) any
Employee, including any Transferred Employee, who has received an offer of
employment from Buyer but has not yet commenced employment with Buyer and who
as of the applicable effective date of their employment with Buyer is
receiving or is entitled to receive short-term or long-term disability
benefits under Schurz's short-term or long-term disability benefit plans shall
receive or continue to be paid such benefits after the applicable effective
date of their employment with Buyer in accordance with the terms of the
disability plans of Schurz and (ii) Buyer shall have no obligation to provide
any disability or other benefits or compensation to any such Person unless and
until they become a Transferred Employee.

 



 

(h) Each applicable Seller shall retain responsibility and liability for
offering and providing "continuation coverage" to the "qualified
beneficiaries" receiving continuation coverage under Schurz's group health
plan as of the day prior to Closing as well as to any "qualified beneficiary"
for which the consummation of the transaction constitutes a "qualifying
event." The terms "continuation coverage", "qualified beneficiary" and
"qualifying event" shall each have the meaning set forth in Section 4980B of
the Internal Revenue Code and Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA.

 



 

 



   



 

(i) The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in
this _Section 5.6_ or any other provision of this Agreement, shall (i) be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement of Schurz, any Seller or
Buyer, (ii) limit the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them, (iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or
obligations in any Person (including any Employee, or Transferred Employee)
other than the parties to this Agreement or create a contract between Buyer,
Schurz, any Seller, or any of their respective Affiliates on the one hand and
any employee of any Seller on the other hand, and no employee of any Seller or
Schurz may rely on this Agreement as the basis for any breach of contract
claim against Buyer or such Seller or Schurz, (iv) be deemed or construed to
require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue to employ any particular
employee of such Seller for any period after the Closing, or (v) be deemed or
construed to limit Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' right to terminate the
employment of any Transferred Employee during any period on or after the
applicable effective date of their employment with Buyer or confer on any
Person any right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term
or condition of employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

5.7 _Accounting Services; Access to and Retention of Records._

 



 

(a) During the first sixty (60) days after the Closing, Buyer shall
provide to Schurz and Sellers, at no additional cost, the reasonable services
of the Business's business offices, together with reasonable access to related
systems and records, for the purposes of closing the books of the Business for
the period prior to the Closing, all substantially in accordance with the
reasonable procedures and practices applied by Buyer's business offices, as
amended from time to time.

 



 

(b) For a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall preserve, in accordance with Buyer's normal document retention
procedures and practices, all books and records transferred by Schurz and
Sellers to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and shall provide Schurz and
Sellers a reasonable opportunity to access and obtain copies, at Schurz's
expense, of any such books and records. In addition to the foregoing, from and
after the Closing, Buyer shall afford to Schurz and Sellers, and its counsel,
accountants, and other authorized agents and representatives, at Schurz's
expense, during normal business hours, reasonable access to the Station
employees, books, records and other data relating to the Purchased Assets, or
the Assumed Obligations in its possession with respect to the periods prior to
the Closing, and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom, to the
extent that such access may be reasonably required by Schurz or any Seller (i)
to facilitate the investigation, litigation and final disposition of any
claims which may have been or may be made against Schurz or any Seller, (ii)
for the preparation of Tax Returns and audits and (iii) for any other
reasonable and proper business purpose, provided in each case that such access
does not unreasonably disrupt the business and operations of the Business or
of Buyer.

 



 

(c) Within 30 Business Days of the date hereof, Schurz will provide Buyer
a list of all Tax Returns currently being filed with respect to each Seller,
indicating if those Tax Returns have been audited, and indicating any Tax
Returns that currently are the subject of audit.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) In the event that Buyer determines prior to Closing that it shall need
transition services for a period after Closing not to exceed ninety (90) days
for any corporate services currently provided by Schurz to any Station or
Seller, then Buyer and Schurz shall enter into a transition services agreement
at Closing, which shall provide that Schurz shall continue to provide such
services to the Station after Closing in a manner consistent with its current
provision of such services for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days after
Closing and Gray shall reimburse Schurz for the cost of such services as
currently reflected on each Station's income statement.

 



 

5.8 _Further Action._ In furtherance (and not in limitation) of the
provisions set forth in this Agreement, at all times prior to the Closing,
Buyer and Schurz and Sellers shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all action necessary or
desirable in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as is practicable.

 



 

5.9 _Title Insurance; Survey._ Buyer may obtain, at its sole option and
expense, and Sellers shall grant Buyer commercially reasonable access to
obtain (a) commitments for owner's and lender's title insurance policies on
the Owned Real Property and commitments for lessee's and lender's title
insurance policies for all Leased Real Property (collectively the " _Title
Commitments_ "), and (b) an ALTA survey on each parcel of Real Property (the "
_Surveys_ "); _provided, however_ , that Sellers shall provide Buyer with any
existing Title Commitments and Surveys in their possession and that have been
obtained in the last five (5) years. The Title Commitments will evidence a
commitment to issue an ALTA title insurance policy insuring marketable fee
simple (or leasehold, if applicable) title to each parcel of the Real Property
contemplated above for such amount as Buyer reasonably directs and will
contain no material exceptions except for Assumed Liabilities or Permitted
Liens. Schurz and each Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in
obtaining such Title Commitments and Surveys (including by providing customary
representations and affidavits to Buyer's title company to the extent
consistent with Schurz's and the Sellers' obligations hereunder); _provided_
that neither Schurz nor any Seller willl be required to incur any cost,
expense or other liability in connection therewith inconsistent with such
Seller's obligations hereunder. If the Title Commitments or Surveys reveal any
Lien on the title, other than Assumed Liabilities or Permitted Liens, Buyer
may notify Seller in writing of such objectionable matter as soon as Buyer
determines that such matter is not an Assumed Liability or Permitted Lien or
otherwise a customary title exception, and Schurz and each Seller shall to use
commercially reasonable efforts to remove such objectionable matter as
required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. At or prior to Closing,
Schurz and each Seller shall be obligated to remedy any title defect that is
of a monetary nature and that is not an Assumed Liability or a Permitted Lien.

 



 

5.10 _Environmental Assessments; Phase I Investigations._

 



 

(a) Within sixty (60) days from the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall
have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to engage an environmental
consulting firm to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment and
Compliance Review, as such terms are commonly understood (" _Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment_ ") _provided_ such environmental assessment,
investigation or review shall be conducted only (i) during regular business
hours, (ii) with no less than two (2) business days prior written notice to
Schurz, (iii) in a manner which will not unduly interfere with the operation
of the Business or the use of access to or egress from the Real Property; and
(iv) with respect to Leased Real Property, if the landlord of such Leased Real
Property consents to such assessment after the applicable Seller requests
permission. Any damage to the Real Property caused by Buyer and its
consultants in conducting any such environmental assessment, investigation or
review shall be repaired by Buyer at its sole cost and expense.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) If the Phase I Environmental Assessment discloses the presence or
likely presence of Hazardous Materials, Buyer, at its sole cost and expense
may within sixty (60) days obtain a Phase II Environmental Assessment ("
_Phase II Environmental Assessment_ ") for each such parcel of Real Property
owned or leased by the applicable Seller with any potential liability with
respect to the Environment _provided_ such Phase II Environmental Assessment
shall be conducted only (i) during regular business hours, (ii) with no less
than two (2) business days prior written notice to Schurz, (iii) in a manner
which will not unduly interfere with the operation of the Business or the use
of access to or egress from the Real Property; and (iv) with respect to Leased
Real Property, if the landlord of such Leased Real Property consents to such
assessment after the applicable Seller requests permission. Any damage to the
Real Property caused by Buyer and its consultants in conducting any Phase II
Environmental Assessment shall be repaired by Buyer at its sole cost and
expense. Prior to conducting any Phase II Environmental Assessment, Buyer
shall obtain written approval for the scope of work from Schurz, which
approval may be withheld or conditioned in Schurz's sole discretion. The Phase
I Environmental Assessment and Phase II Environmental Assessment are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Assessments_."

 



 

(c) Buyer shall pay all the costs and expenses of any Assessments
regardless of whether this Agreement is terminated or closed. Schurz and Buyer
agree that the results of the Assessments carried out pursuant to this
_Section_ _5.10_ shall not be disclosed to any third party, unless such
disclosure is required by law in Schurz's sole discretion; _provided,_
_however,_ that each party may disclose such information to such party's
officers, directors, employees, lenders, advisors, attorneys, Financing
Sources and accountants who need to know such information in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and who
are informed by such party of the confidential nature of such information.

 



 

(d) If any Assessments reveal the presence of Hazardous Materials the
remediation of which is required under any applicable Environmental Laws or if
any Assessments reveal the likely presence of Hazardous Materials that would
require remediation, then Schurz and each Seller agrees, at their cost, to
perform such environmental remediation or provide Buyer with a purchase price
reduction for the estimated cost of such environmental remediation, as
reasonably determined by the environmental consulting firm which performed the
applicable Assessment; _provided, however_ , that if such remediation is
estimated to cost in excess of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00), Schurz,
at its option, may (i) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Buyer
without further liability, or (ii) proceed to close the transaction with
Schurz assuming the responsibility for the environmental remediation only to
the extent necessary to come in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws
or providing Buyer with a purchase price reduction for the estimated cost of
such remediation; provided, further that, if such remediation is estimated to
cost in excess of Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000.00), either Schurz or
Buyer, at its option, may (x) terminate this Agreement by written notice to
the other party without further liability, or (y) if neither Schurz nor Buyer
terminates this Agreement, proceed to close the transaction with Schurz
assuming the responsibility for the environmental remediation only to the
extent necessary to come in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws or
providing Buyer with a purchase price reduction for the estimated cost of such
remediation. If the Closing is not consummated hereunder, neither party shall
have any obligation to remediate any potential liability with respect to the
results of such Assessments. Any damage to the Real Property caused by Buyer
and its consultants in conducting any Assessment shall be repaired by Buyer at
its sole cost and expense. Any such environmental remediation required of
either party under this _Section 5.10(d)_ shall entail the most cost-effective
method necessary to obtain the risk-based standards specified by applicable
Environmental Laws given the commercial use of the applicable Real Property
and taking into account any engineering or institutional controls feasible at
such Real Property. In the event that Schurz elects to withhold consent for
any Phase II Environmental Assessment, Buyer, at its option, may (1) terminate
this Agreement by written notice to the other party without further liability
or (2) proceed to close the transaction with Schurz indemnifying Buyer any
actual Liability directly related to facts that would have been discovered in
such Phase II Environmental Assessment.

and all such agreements, obligations and arrangements shall be deemed to be,
and shall be, terminated in all respects (notwithstanding anything therein

harmless Schurz, Sellers, their Affiliates, and their respective employees,
officers, directors, representatives and agents and all of their successors
and assigns (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and
all Damages incurred by any of the Seller Indemnified Parties, whether or not
resulting from third party claims, arising out of or resulting from:

 



 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representations and warranties made by
Buyer under this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to
_Section_ _8.2(d)_ (in each case, without giving effect to any materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifiers);

 



 

(ii) any default or breach by Buyer of any covenant or agreement made in
this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) the Assumed Obligations; and

 



 

(iv) the ownership, business or operation of the Business after the
Effective Time (other than in respect of the Retained Obligations).

 



 

9.3 _Procedures with Respect to Third Party Claims._

 



 

(a) The indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party of any demand, suit, claim or assertion of liability by
third parties that is subject to indemnification hereunder (a " _Claim_ "),
but a failure to give such notice or delaying such notice shall not affect the
indemnified party's rights or the indemnifying party's obligations except to
the extent the indemnifying party's ability to remedy, contest, defend or
settle with respect to such Claim is thereby materially prejudiced and
provided that, where applicable, such notice is given within the time period
described in _Section _ _9.1_.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) The indemnifying party shall have the right to undertake the defense
or opposition to such Claim (at the indemnifying party's expense) with counsel
selected by it so long as (i) the indemnifying party gives written notice to
the indemnified party within thirty (30) days after it has been notified of
the Claim that it will defend the indemnified party against such Claim and the
indemnifying party acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the indemnified
party for Damages related to such Claim (subject to the Threshold and Cap, to
the extent applicable), (ii) the Claim involves only money damages and does
not seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the indemnified party
that would reasonably be expected to materially restrict or materially and
adversely affect the future activity or conduct of the Business by Buyer,
(iii) the indemnified party has not been advised in writing by outside counsel
that a material legal conflict exists between the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party in connection with conducting the defense of the Claim,
(iv) the Claim does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection with any
criminal or regulatory enforcement action that would reasonably be expected to
materially restrict or materially and adversely affect the future activity or
conduct of the Business by Buyer, and (v) the indemnifying party conducts the
defense of the Claim in good faith. In the event that the indemnifying party
does not, within thirty (30) days of its receipt of notice of a Claim pursuant
to clause (i) above of this _Section_ _9.3(b)_ , elect to undertake such
defense or opposition, the indemnified party may undertake the defense,
opposition, compromise or settlement of such Claim with counsel selected by it
at the indemnifying party's cost; _provided, that_ the indemnifying party
shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
indemnitees in connection with such Claim. If the indemnified party defends
any Claim pursuant to the preceding sentence or pursuant to clauses (ii) - (v)
above of this _Section_ _9.3(b)_ , then the indemnifying party shall promptly
reimburse the applicable indemnified party for the reasonable costs and
expenses of defending such Claim upon submission of periodic bills.

 



 

(c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding:

 



 

(i) the indemnified party shall have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement
of the Claim;

 



 

(ii) the indemnifying party shall not, without the indemnified party's
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), settle or compromise any Claim or consent to entry of any
judgment which settlement, compromise or judgment (x) by its terms does not
obligate the indemnifying party (or its Affiliates) to pay the full amount of
any Damages in connection with such Claim, (y) requires any payment or other
action by, or limitation on, any indemnified party or (z) does not include the
giving by the claimant to the indemnified party of a full release from all
liability in respect of such Claim;

 



 

(iii) if the indemnified party defends any Claim pursuant to _Section_
_9.3(b)_ , the indemnified party shall not, without the indemnifying party's
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), settle or compromise any Claim or consent to entry of any
judgment with respect to such Claim; and

 



 

(iv) the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall cooperate in
the conduct of the defense of any Claim, including by providing reasonable
access to each other's relevant business records and other documents and
employees, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid production
of confidential information (consistent with applicable Legal Requirement),
and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and others
representing any party to a Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable
attorney-client or work-product privileges, if practicable.

 



 

 



   



 

9.4 _No Special Damages; Mitigation._ No indemnifying party shall be
liable to any indemnified party for special, indirect, consequential, punitive
or exemplary damages of any kind, in each case unless and to the extent such
damages are actually paid to a third party (who is not an Affiliate of the
indemnified party). Each party agrees to exercise its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Damages in respect of any pending or threatened Claim.

 



 

9.5 _Offset_ _._ The amount of any Damages indemnifiable by any
indemnifying party to any indemnified party pursuant to this Article 9 will be
reduced to reflect any amount actually recovered or recoverable by the
indemnified party under the indemnified party's insurance policies or
otherwise with respect to such Damages (less any increase in premiums related
thereto).

 



 

9.6 _Treatment of Indemnity Benefits._ All payments made by Schurz or
Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, to or for the benefit of the other
pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be
treated, unless otherwise required by law, as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of
this Agreement.

 



 

9.7 _Exclusive Remedies._ Buyer, Schurz and Sellers acknowledge and agree
that, if the Closing occurs, the indemnification provisions of this Article 9
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Buyer, Schurz and Sellers for any
breach of the representations or warranties or nonperformance of or default
under any covenants or agreements of Buyer, Schurz or Sellers contained in
this Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary Agreements or Seller Ancillary
Agreements, and neither party shall have any liability to the other party
under any circumstances for special, indirect, consequential, punitive or
exemplary damages, or lost profits, or any damage calculated on the basis of a
multiple of earnings, profits or similar measure, unless and to the extent
such damages are actually paid to a third party (who is not an Affiliate of
the third party); provided _,_ however _,_ that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall relieve or limit the liability of any party from any liability
or Damages arising out of or resulting from such party's fraud in connection
with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the Seller Ancillary
Agreements or the Buyer Ancillary Agreements. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each of Buyer, Schurz and each Seller hereby waive, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, except in the case of fraud, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the others arising
under or based upon any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation
(including any such rights, claims or causes of action arising under or based
upon common law, tort or otherwise and relating to this Agreement, any Seller
Ancillary Document or any Buyer Ancillary Document (including any certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section_ _6.1(c)_ or _Section_ _7.1(c)_ ) or the
transactions contemplated hereby) other than any rights, claims or actions
arising under this Article 9.

 



 

9.8 _Effect of Investigation._ The right to indemnification or any other
remedy based on representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement, any Seller Ancillary Agreement or Buyer Ancillary Agreement shall
not be affected by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to
the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

Article 10 
TERMINATION AND REMEDIES

 



 

10.1 _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing as
follows:

 



 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Schurz;

 



 

(b) by written notice of Buyer to Schurz and Sellers if (i) Buyer is not
in material breach of its representations, warranties or covenants under this
Agreement, (ii) Schurz or Sellers breach their representations or warranties,
or defaults in the performance of their covenants, contained in this Agreement
and (iii) all such breaches and defaults by Schurz or Sellers that are not
cured within the Cure Period (as defined in _Section _ _10.2_ ) would prevent
any of the conditions to the obligations of Buyer set forth in Article 7 from
being satisfied;

 



 

(c) by written notice of Schurz to Buyer if (i) Schurz and Sellers are not
in material breach of their representations, warranties or covenants under
this Agreement, (ii) Buyer breaches its representations or warranties, or
defaults in the performance of its covenants, contained in this Agreement and
(iii) all such Buyer breaches and defaults that are not cured within the Cure
Period would prevent the conditions to the obligations of Schurz and Sellers
set forth in Article 6 from being satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Cure Period shall apply to Buyer's obligations to pay the Purchase Price at
Closing;

 



 

(d) by written notice of Buyer to Schurz, or by Schurz to Buyer, if the
Closing does not occur by the date that is twelve (12) months after the date
of this Agreement (such date, the " _Outside Date_ "), unless the Closing has
not occurred by such date as a result of a material breach of this Agreement
by the party providing such notice of termination; and _provided_ that if, as
of the Outside Date, the parties are required to consummate the Closing
pursuant to _Section_ _1.7(a)_ but for the operation of the second proviso in
_Section_ _1.7(a)_ (i.e., the Marketing Period has not ended), the Outside
Date shall automatically be extended to one day after the new date on which
the parties are required to consummate the Closing pursuant to such proviso;

 



 

(e) pursuant to _Section 5.10(d)_ ; or

 



 

(f) by Buyer or Schurz in the event that (i) there shall be any law that
makes consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal
or (ii) any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order restraining or
enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order
shall have become final and non-appealable.

 



 

10.2 _Cure Period._ Prior to the Closing, each party shall give the other
party prompt written notice upon learning of any breach or default by the
other party under this Agreement, and such notice shall specify the breach.
The term "Cure Period" as used herein means a period commencing on the date
Buyer or Schurz receives from the other written notice of breach or default
hereunder and continuing until the earlier of (i) thirty (30) calendar days
thereafter or (ii) five (5) Business Days after the day otherwise scheduled
for Closing; provided, however, that, in the case of clause (i) above, if the
breach or default is non-monetary and cannot reasonably be cured within such
period but can be cured before the date that is five (5) Business Days after
the scheduled Closing Date, and if diligent efforts to cure promptly commence,
then the Cure Period shall continue as long as such diligent efforts to cure
continue, but not beyond the date that is five (5) Business Days after the
scheduled Closing Date.

 



 

 



   



 

10.3 _Termination and Survival._

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section_ _10.3_ , in the
event of a termination of this Agreement by either Schurz or Buyer as provided
in _Section_ _10.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Schurz, Sellers,
Buyer or their respective directors, officers, employees, incorporators,
members, partners, equity holders, Affiliates, agents, attorneys or
representatives; provided that the provisions of this _Section_ _10.3_ and
_Section _ _5.1_ _(a)_ (Confidentiality), _Section _ _11.1_ (Expenses),
_Section _ _11.6_ (Entire Agreement), _Section 11.9_ (Governing Law; Consent
to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial), _Section _ _11.10_ (Neutral
Construction), _Section _ _11.12_ (Counterparts; Delivery by
Facsimile/Email), _Section _ _11.13_ (Interpretation) and _Section_ _11.16_
(Non-Recourse) shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _however_ , that, if a
termination shall have resulted from a breach or fraud of a party (including
Buyer's failure to consummate the Closing when required), the termination of
this Agreement shall not relieve such breaching party of any liability for
such breach or fraud under this Agreement that occurred prior to the date of
termination.

 



 

(b) If Buyer or Schurz terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Sections_
_10.1(d)_ or _10.1(f)_ and, at the time of such termination (i) any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ , _Section 6.4_ , _Section 7.3_ and
_Section 7.4_ shall not have been satisfied and (ii) all other material
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article 6_ and _Article 7_ shall have
been or are reasonably expected to be satisfied (other than (x) any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ , _Section 6.4_ , _Section 7.3_ and
_Section 7.4_ , and (y) conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing but which conditions would in the case of this clause (y) be
satisfied or reasonably expected to be satisfied if the Closing occurred on
the date of termination), then Buyer shall within three (3) Business Days
following the delivery of the termination notice from Schurz (or, in the case
of a Buyer termination, within three (3) Business Days following the delivery
of the notice from Schurz invoking this _Section 10.3(b)_ , which notice shall
also certify that all material conditions set forth in _Article 6_ and
_Article 7_ have been satisfied or are reasonably expected to be satisfied
(other than (x) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ , _Section
6.4_ , _Section 7.3_ and _Section 7.4_ , and (y) conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied or reasonably expected to be satisfied at the
Closing but which conditions would in the case of this clause (y) be satisfied
if the Closing occurred on the date of termination)), pay or cause to be paid
to Schurz the sum of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (the " _Business Disruption Termination Fee_ ").

 



 

(c) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that the Business Disruption Termination Fee is not a penalty,
but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate Schurz and Sellers in
the circumstances in which the Business Disruption Termination Fee is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Closing, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and such termination
gives rise to the obligation of Buyer to pay the Business Disruption
Termination Fee and Buyer shall have paid the Business Disruption Termination
Fee pursuant to this Section 10.3, the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Schurz, Sellers and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates
(collectively, the " _Seller Related Parties_ ") against Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates and any
Financing Source, together with each Financing Source's Affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, equity holders, partners,
controlling parties, advisors, agents and representatives, and their
respective successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Financing Related
Parties_ ") for any business disruption, demands, claims, actions or causes of
action, assessments, losses, damages, liabilities, diminution in value, costs
and expenses, including interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses, shall be the Business Disruption Termination Fee, and following such
payment no Person shall have any rights or claims against Schurz, Sellers,
Buyer and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and
Affiliates and any Financing Related Party under this Agreement, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of Schurz, Sellers,
Buyer and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and
Affiliates and any Financing Related Party shall have any further liability or
obligation resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection with,
this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in _Section 10.3(a)_. For
purposes of clarity, the parties acknowledge and agree that this _Section
10.3(d)_ shall not prohibit Schurz or Sellers from seeking any other remedy
available under this Agreement, at law, or in equity in the event of the
termination of this Agreement under _Section 10.1(c)_.

 



 

10.4 _Specific Performance._ Subject to Section 1.8, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto would be irreparably damaged if
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached and that any non-performance or
breach of this Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately
compensated by monetary damages alone and that the parties hereto would not
have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right
or remedy to which any party hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity
(including monetary damages), subject to Section 1.8, prior to termination of
this Agreement, such party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this
Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary
and permanent injunctive relief, subject to obtaining any required
Governmental Consents, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of
the provisions of this Agreement without posting any bond or other
undertaking. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ , the parties hereto
agree that, the party seeking specific performance shall be entitled to
enforce specifically (a) a party's obligations under Section 1.8; and (b) a
party's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the Closing and to pay the
Purchase Price, if applicable), if the conditions set forth in Article 6 or
Article 7, as applicable, have been satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) or waived.

 



 

 



   



 

Article 11 
MISCELLANEOUS

 



 

11.1 _Expenses._ Except as may be otherwise specified herein, each party
shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in
connection with the negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance
with the terms of this Agreement, the Seller Ancillary Agreements and the
Buyer Ancillary Agreements. If more than one HSR Act filing is necessary
because a party has more than one ultimate Buyer entity, then such party shall
pay the HSR Act filing fees for any additional filings. Buyer shall pay one-
half (1/2) and Schurz shall pay one-half (1/2) of all governmental Taxes, fees
and charges applicable to the transfer of the Purchased Assets under this
Agreement (including sales, use and real property transfer taxes and the costs
of recording or filing all applicable conveyance instruments) (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes"); provided, however, that Schurz and Sellers shall be solely
responsible for any and all income taxes incurred by them due to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. The parties
will cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns
regarding Transfer Taxes and in seeking or perfecting any available exemption
from Transfer Taxes. Each party is responsible for any commission, brokerage
fee, advisory fee or other similar payment that arises as a result of any
agreement or action of it or any Person acting on its behalf in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event of
any litigation regarding or arising from this Agreement prior to the Closing,
the prevailing party as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
final non-appealable judgment shall be entitled to recover its reasonable
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred therein
or in the enforcement or collection of any judgment or award rendered therein.

 



 

11.2 _Further Assurances._ After Closing, each party shall from time to
time, at the request of and without further cost or expense to the other,
execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and assumption and
take such other actions as may reasonably be requested in order to more
effectively consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

11.3 _Assignment._ __Neither party may assign this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other party hereto, provided, however, that (a)
Buyer may by written notice to, but without consent of, Schurz and Sellers,
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate of Buyer, provided
that any such assignment does not materially delay the processing of the FCC
Application, the grant of the FCC Consent, the HSR Clearance or the Closing;
provided, further that Buyer shall remain liable for all of its obligations
hereunder (including those assigned to such assignee); (b) Buyer may
collaterally assign any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder to any
provider of debt financing to it to the extent permitted by the Communications
Laws; and (c) Buyer may assign its right to purchase the Designated Station
Assets with respect to the Stations set forth on _Schedule 11.3_ (and delegate
its duty to assume the Assumed Obligations corresponding thereto) to a third
party that is eligible pursuant to the Communications Laws to be the assignee
of the Designated Station Assets and the licensee of the FCC Licenses included
in the Designated Station Assets (a " _Qualified Assignee_ ") by written
notice to Schurz and the applicable Seller. With respect to any assignment
permitted under subsections (a) or (c) of this Section 11.3, (i) any such
Qualified Assignee shall deliver to Schurz and the applicable Seller a written
instrument of assumption with respect to this Agreement or the Designated
Station Assets, as applicable, in which such assignee (A) shall make to Schurz
and the applicable Seller the representations and warranties contained in
Article 3 of this Agreement with respect to such assignee and (B) shall
covenant to Schurz and the applicable Seller to observe, satisfy, discharge
and perform the covenants of Buyer set forth in this Agreement except to the
extent that any such covenant relates solely to Station Assets other than
Designated Stations Assets and the corresponding Assumed Obligations, (ii)
Buyer shall remain liable for all of its obligations hereunder (including
those assigned to such assignee) and (iii) the consummation of the purchase of
such Designated Stations Assets shall occur simultaneously herewith, with
Schurz or the applicable Seller accepting payment of the purchase price for
the Designated Station Assets directly from the Qualified Assignee (the " _QA
Payment_ "), and the Purchase Price hereunder shall be reduced by the amount
of such QA Payment, if any. " _Designated Station Assets_ " means such
Purchased Assets with respect to such Station as Buyer and the Qualified
Assignee may mutually agree. The terms of this Agreement shall bind and inure
to the benefit of the parties' respective successors and any permitted
assigns, and no assignment shall relieve any party of any obligation or
liability under this Agreement.

11.5 _Amendments; Waiver_ _._ No amendment or waiver of compliance with
any provision hereof or consent pursuant to this Agreement shall be effective
unless evidenced by an instrument in writing signed, in the case of an
amendment, by Buyer, Schurz and Sellers, or in the case of a waiver or
consent, by the party against whom the waiver or consent is to be effective.
No waiver by any party of any breach or violation of, default under or
inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent breach
or violation of, default under, or inaccuracy in, any such representation,
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No delay or omission on the
part of any party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this

contrary in the foregoing, no FS Provision may be amended or waived without
the consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

11.6 _Entire Agreement_ _._ The Schedules and Exhibits hereto are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement. This Agreement, together with any other
agreement executed on the date hereof in connection herewith, constitutes the
entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof, except the NDA,
which shall remain in full force and effect, in accordance with its terms,
subject to Section 5.1. No party makes any representation or warranty with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement, any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or any
of the Buyer Ancillary Agreements or Seller Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

11.7 _Severability_ _._ If any Governmental Entity holds any provision in
this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any party or to
any circumstance under any applicable law, then, so long as no party is
deprived of the benefits of this Agreement in any material respect, (a) such
provision, as applied to such party or such circumstance, is hereby deemed
modified to give effect to the original written intent of the parties to the
greatest extent consistent with being valid and enforceable under applicable
law, (b) the application of such provision to any other party or to any other
circumstance will not be affected or impaired thereby and (c) the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.

 



 

 



   



 

11.8 _Third Party Beneficiaries; No Recourse to Financing Sources._

 



 

(a) Except for the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified
Parties, nothing in this Agreement expressed or implied is intended or shall
be construed to give any rights to any Person other than the parties hereto
and their successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Financing Sources shall be an express third-party beneficiary with respect to
Section 11.8 and Section 11.9 and any limitations on Buyer's liabilities
pursuant to Article 9 (the " _FS Provisions_ ").

 



 

(b) Subject to the rights of Buyer and/or its Affiliates under the terms
of any agreement with any Financing Source relating to the Financing, none of
the parties hereto, nor any of their respective Affiliates, solely in their
respective capacities as parties to this Agreement, shall have any rights or
claims (whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
any Financing Source or any Affiliate thereof, solely in their respective
capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Financing, and the
Financing Sources, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or
arrangers, shall not have any rights or claims against any party hereto or any
related Person thereof, in connection with this Agreement or the Financing,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, except for any
rights or claims of the Financing Sources with respect to the Buyer pursuant
to the terms of the Financing.

 



 

11.9 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial._

 



 

(a) This Agreement and the negotiation, execution, performance or
nonperformance, interpretation, termination, construction and all matters
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether arising in
law or in equity (collectively, the " _Covered Matters_ "), and all claims or
causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to the Covered Matters, except for documents, agreements and
instruments that specify otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware without giving effect to the choice of law provisions thereof. All
recording matters relating to the conveyance of each parcel of Owned Real
Property will be conducted in conformity with the applicable requirements of
local law governing the location of such parcel.

 



 

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined exclusively in the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware, or of the United States of America for the State of Delaware, and
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts (and, in the case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably waive the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The
consents to jurisdiction set forth in this _Section 11.9_ shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and
shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this _Section
11.9_ and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any third party. The parties
hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and
