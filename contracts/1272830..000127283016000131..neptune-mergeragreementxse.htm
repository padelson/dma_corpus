of Company Capital Stock held in the Company's treasury ("Treasury Shares") or
owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
payment of consideration therefor (such shares of Company Capital Stock,
together with any Dissenting Shares, the "Disregarded Shares").

(c) Conversion of Series D Preferred Stock. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger,
each share of Series D Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Disregarded Shares), shall be
cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive (following the satisfaction of all applicable Payment Conditions, and
apportioned between cash and shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in
Section 2.3):

(i) an amount equal to (A) the Series D Preference Amount, minus (B) the Per
Share Escrow Contribution Amount with respect to such share of Series D
Preferred Stock;

(ii) any disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund with respect
to such share of Series D Preferred Stock to the former holder thereof in
accordance with Section 9.8, as and when such disbursements are required to be

(iii) any additional amount that may be required to be paid by Parent with
respect to such share of Series D Preferred Stock to the former holder thereof
in accordance with Section 2.4(f), as and when such payment is required to be
made; and

(iv) any payments of cash and/or issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock, if
any, due pursuant to Section 2.12 in respect of such share of Series D
Preferred Stock.

provided, however, that any consideration payable pursuant to clause (i) to
any holder of Series D Preferred Stock shall be subject to the conditions and
contingencies of such holder's Investment Representation Letter. The number of
shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder is entitled to receive under
this Section 2.1(c) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) Conversion of Series C Preferred Stock. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger,
each share of Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Disregarded Shares), shall
automatically be deemed to convert into Company Common Stock in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation immediately prior to the Effective Time
and shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.1(g).

(e) Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger,
each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately

receive (following the satisfaction of all applicable Payment Conditions, and
apportioned between cash and shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in
Section 2.3):

(i) an amount equal to (A) the Series B Per Share Amount, minus (B) the Per
Share Escrow Contribution Amount with respect to such share of Series B
Preferred Stock;

(ii) any disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund with respect
to such share of Series B Preferred Stock to the former holder thereof in
accordance with Section 9.8, as and when such disbursements are required to be
made;

(iii) any additional amount that may be required to be paid by Parent with
respect to such share of Series B Preferred Stock to the former holder thereof
in accordance with Section 2.4(f), as and when such payment is required to be

(iv) any payments of cash and/or issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock, if
any, due pursuant to Section 2.12 in respect of such share of Series B
Preferred Stock;

provided, however, that any consideration payable pursuant to clause (i) to
any holder of Series B Preferred Stock shall be subject to the conditions and
contingencies of such holder's Investment Representation Letter. The number of
shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder is entitled to receive under
this Section 2.1(e) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock.

(f) Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger,
each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Disregarded Shares), shall
automatically be deemed to convert into Company Common Stock in accordance

the right to receive (following the satisfaction of all applicable Payment
Conditions, and apportioned between cash and shares of Parent Common Stock as
set forth in Section 2.3):

(i) an amount equal to (A) the Residual Per Share Amount, minus (B) the Per
Share Escrow Contribution Amount with respect to such share of Company Common
Stock;

(ii) any disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund with respect
to such share of Company Common Stock to the former holder thereof in
accordance with Section 9.8, as and when such disbursements are required to be

(iii) any additional amount that may be required to be paid by Parent with
respect to such share of Company Common Stock to the former holder thereof in
accordance with Section 2.4(f), as and when such payment is required to be
made; and

(iv) any payments of cash and/or issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock, if
any, due pursuant to Section 2.12 in respect of such share of Company Common
Stock;

provided, however, that any consideration payable pursuant to clause (i) to
any holder of Company Common Stock shall be subject to the conditions and
contingencies of such holder's Investment Representation Letter and, if such
holder is a Management Holder, the provisions of such holder's Support
Agreement. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder is
entitled to receive under this Section 2.1(g) shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.

(h) Adjustments. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital
Stock occurring in compliance with the terms hereof after the Agreement Date
and prior to the Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified
numbers of shares (or any per share dollar amounts) of any class or series
affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon
numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices or other per share
dollar amounts therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the
extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change. Unless indicated otherwise, all
mathematical calculations contemplated by this Agreement shall be made to the
fifth decimal place.

2.2 Treatment of Company Options.

(a) Vested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option
(after giving effect to any acceleration pursuant to Section 2.2(h)) held by a
Company Optionholder (other than an Indemnifying Optionholder) that is not an
Underwater Option shall terminate and be cancelled without further action by
the parties hereto or the Company Optionholders and upon the cancellation
thereof such Company Option shall be converted into the right to receive for
each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, an amount
in cash equal to (i) the Residual Per Share Amount, minus (ii) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (such
amount, a "Cash Option Payment" and the sum of all such payments, the
"Aggregate Cash Option Payment").

(b) Indemnifying Optionholders. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Company Option that is then unvested, outstanding and unexercised and held by
the Indemnifying Optionholders shall become fully vested and exercisable. At
the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option (after giving effect to any
acceleration pursuant to this Section 2.2(b)) held by an Indemnifying
Optionholder that is not an Underwater Option shall terminate and be cancelled
without further action by the parties hereto or the Company Optionholders and
upon the cancellation thereof such Company Option shall be converted into the
right to receive for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option (apportioned between cash and shares of Parent Stock as set
forth in Section 2.3):

(v) an amount equal to (A) the Residual Per Share Amount, minus (B) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option (such amount, a "Indemnifying Option Cash Payment" and the sum of all
such payments, the "Aggregate Indemnifying Option Cash Payment");

(vi) any disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund with respect
to such share to the former holder thereof in accordance with Section 9.8, as
and when such disbursements are required to be made;

(vii) any additional amount that may be required to be paid by Parent with
respect to such share to the former holder thereof in accordance with Section
2.4(f), as and when such payment is required to be made; and

(viii) any payments of cash and/or issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock,
if any, due pursuant to Section 2.12 in respect of such share;

provided, however, that any consideration payable pursuant to clause (i) to
any Indemnifying Optionholder shall be subject to the conditions and
contingencies of such holder's Support Agreement and Investment Representation
Letter. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder is
entitled to receive under this Section 2.2(b) shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Stock.

(c) Withholding. All consideration to be received by the holders of
Withholding Options pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall be paid to and
distributed by the Surviving Corporation promptly after the Effective Time,
treated as compensation by it and shall be net of any applicable Taxes
withheld pursuant to Section 2.10. All consideration to be received by the
holders of Company Options that are not Withholding Options pursuant to this
Section 2.2 shall be, subject to each such holder first providing all
documentation required by Parent (including an IRS Form W-9 or any successor
form), paid to and distributed by the Exchange Agent to such Company
Optionholder. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide notice (in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of Vested Company
Options describing the treatment of the Vested Company Options in accordance
with this Section 2.2. No holder of any Underwater Option shall be entitled to
any consideration with respect thereto.

(d) Exercise of EMI Options. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall provide to each EMI Optionholder who holds Vested
EMI Options: (i) written notice, in such form as may be agreed between the
Company and Parent, that such holder's EMI Options shall be exercisable on the
day prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) a notice of exercise in respect of
Vested EMI Options in such form as may be agreed between the Company and
Parent (the "EMI Exercise Notice"). Each EMI Optionholder who returns a duly
completed EMI Exercise Notice to the Company by the day which is two days
prior to the Effective Time (or such other later time as the Company and the
Parent may agree), thereby instructs (such instructions being contingent on
the Closing taking place) Parent to pay to the Company, in such EMI
Optionholder's name and on such EMI Optionholder's behalf, at the Effective
Time, subject to Section 2.8: (A) the exercise price of each Vested EMI Option
which is not an Underwater Option and that is exercised prior to or contingent
upon the Closing multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock to
be received by such holder as a result of the exercise of each such EMI Option
(the "EMI Exercise Price"); and (B) an amount equal to any liability for
income tax or other Taxes in respect of which the Company is liable to account
to HMRC or any other Tax authority (including any income tax, primary class 1
(employees') National Insurance contributions and secondary class 1
(employer's) National Insurance contributions or other similar levies) which
arise as a consequence of or in connection with the exercise of such EMI
Options (collectively, the "EMI Option Taxes", and, together with the EMI
Exercise Price, the "EMI Option Amount"). Consequently, the consideration to
be paid to each holder of an EMI Option in accordance with Section 2.8 in
respect of Company Common Stock received on exercise of such Vested EMI
Options shall be reduced by the EMI Option Amount. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall issue all shares of Common Stock with respect to which
each Vested EMI Option which is not an Underwater Option is due to be
exercised pursuant to the EMI Exercise Notices prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall cause to be delivered to the Company the aggregate exercise price
for all Company Common Stock issued upon the exercise of each Vested EMI
Option which is not an Underwater Option prior to or contingent upon the
Closing, together with the full amount of any EMI Option Taxes arising in
connection with the exercise of any such Vested EMI Options. For the avoidance
of doubt, if the Vested EMI Options are not exercised, they will be treated as
Vested Company Options in accordance with Section 2.2(a). All holders of
exercised EMI Options will be treated as Non-Qualifying Holders for purposes
of this Agreement.

(e) Assumed Options. Subject to Section 2.1(f), at the Effective Time, each
Unvested Company Option (including any Unvested EMI Option) that is set forth
on Schedule 2.2(d) shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, be assumed by Parent (each such Unvested Company Option, an
"Assumed Option") in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A
of the Code; provided, however, that the parties shall update and finalize
such schedule of Assumed Options immediately prior to the Closing, it being
understood that Parent will assume only Unvested Company Options that are held
by Company Optionholders who are Company Continuing Employees. Each Unvested
Company Option held by a Company Optionholder who is not a Continuing Company
Employee, subject to Section 2.2(h), shall be cancelled and terminated without
consideration upon the Effective Time. Each Assumed Option shall otherwise
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including
the vesting arrangements and other terms and conditions set forth in the
Company Stock Plan and the applicable stock option or other agreement) as are
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) Parent
shall have any and all amendment and administrative authority with respect to
such option (subject, in the case of any amendment, to any required consent of
the affected Company Optionholder), (ii) such option shall become exercisable
for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
(rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock) of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would have been issuable
upon exercise of such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (B) the Equity Exchange Ratio, and (iii) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the next whole
cent) obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock at which such Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Equity Exchange Ratio. All Assumed Options that prior to
the Effective Time were treated as "incentive stock options" within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code shall from and after the Effective Time be
treated as non-qualified stock options and shall not be treated as incentive
stock options under the Code, and any Assumed Options that prior to the
Effective Time include an "early exercise" feature that permitted the option
to be exercised prior to the time that the option had vested shall from and
after the Effective Time no longer include such an early-exercise feature.
Clauses (ii) and (iii) above shall be subject to such reasonable adjustments
to (A) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of which
each Assumed Option which is an Unvested EMI Option (and for which the Company
has received a duly completed Unvested EMI Form of Instruction) is
exercisable, and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option, in each case as is
necessary in order to ensure that such Assumed Option satisfies the
requirements of paragraphs 43(6) and (7) of Schedule 5 to ITEPA. For the
avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not apply if the Assumed
Option is not an Unvested EMI Option for which the Company has received a duly
completed Unvested EMI Form of Instruction.

(f) Assumed EMI Options. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall provide to each EMI Optionholder holding Unvested
EMI Options (A) written notice, in such form as may be agreed between the
Company and Parent, that such EMI Optionholder's EMI Option may be converted
on the terms set out therein (such terms to be compliant with Schedule 5 of
ITEPA, and as agreed between the Company and the Parent) into an option to
acquire Parent Common Stock and (B) a form of instruction, in such form as may
be agreed between the Company and Parent (the "Unvested EMI Form of
Instruction"), which shall provide for, subject to such form being duly
completed and returned to the Company prior to the Effective Time by the
relevant EMI Optionholder, the conversion of such EMI Optionholder's Unvested
EMI Options into enterprise management incentive options in the Parent
("Parent EMI Options"). The Parent agrees to treat all Parent EMI Options, to
the extent permitted by law, as enterprise management incentive options for
the purposes of Schedule 5 of ITEPA. Notwithstanding the above, in the event
that the Parent is informed by HM Revenue and Customs that the Parent EMI
Options are not eligible for any tax-favored status applicable to enterprise
management options, the Parent will cease to treat such Parent EMI Options as
enterprise management options for the purposes of Schedule 5 of ITEPA. The
holders of such Parent EMI Options shall have no recourse to the Parent as a
result of such loss of enterprise management incentive status. Unvested EMI
Options in respect of which the relevant EMI Optionholder does not return an
Unvested EMI Form of Instruction shall not be treated by the Parent as
qualifying enterprise management incentive options with tax favored status.
The Company shall notify HM Revenue and Customs in a timely manner of the issue
of such Parent EMI Options.

(g) Company Actions. The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take or
cause to be taken such actions, and shall obtain all such consents, as may be
required to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2.

(h) Acceleration. Except for the Company Options set forth on Schedule 2.2(h),
the Company will not take any action to accelerate the vesting of any Company
Options beyond what is contractually required as of the Agreement Date as
specified in Schedule 3.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and will take
any action that it is permitted to take to ensure that the vesting of such
Company Options is not accelerated.

(i) Registration of Assumed Options. Parent will (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Assumed Options to be registered with the SEC on Form S‑8 no later than 30
days following the Effective Time, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such
Assumed Options remain outstanding, and (iii) maintain a sufficient number of
reserved shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance upon exercise or vesting,
as applicable, thereof.

2.3 Apportionment of Payments and Escrow Contributions.

(a) With respect to any Qualifying Holder, the Merger Consideration payable to
such Qualifying Holder pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i), Section 2.1(c)(ii),
Section 2.1(e)(i), Section 2.1(e)(ii), Section 2.1(g)(i) and Section
2.1(g)(ii), shall be payable as: (A) an amount in cash equal to the product of
(1) such Qualifying Holder's Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section
2.1(c)(i), Section 2.1(c)(ii), Section 2.1(e)(i), Section 2.1(e)(ii), Section
2.1(g)(i) and Section 2.1(g)(ii), multiplied by (2) the Cash Percentage; and
(B) that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1)
the product of (aa) such Qualifying Holder's Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i), Section 2.1(c)(ii), Section 2.1(e)(i), Section
2.1(e)(ii), Section 2.1(g)(i) and Section 2.1(g)(ii), multiplied by (bb) the
Stock Percentage, divided by (2) the Average Trading Price. In determining the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to each Qualifying
Holder, all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to each holder with respect
to its shares of Company Capital Stock shall be aggregated before determining
fractional shares. With respect to any Non-Qualifying Holder, such Non-
Qualifying Holder's Merger Consideration shall be payable entirely in cash.

(b) With respect to any Qualifying Holder, the Per Share Escrow Contribution
Amount with respect to each share of Company Capital Stock held by such
Qualifying Holder shall be contributed to the Escrow Fund as: (A) an amount in
cash equal to the product of (1) such Per Share Escrow Contribution Amount,
multiplied by (2) the Cash Percentage; and (B) that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the product of (aa) such Per Share
Escrow Contribution Amount, multiplied by (bb) the Stock Percentage, divided
by (2) the Average Trading Price. In determining the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock that will be contributed to the Escrow Fund by
each Qualifying Holder, all shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the
Escrow Fund by such Qualifying Holder with respect to its shares of Company
Capital Stock pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be
aggregated before determining fractional shares. With respect to any Non-
Qualifying Holder, such Non-Qualifying Holder's Per Share Escrow Contribution
Amount with respect to each share of Company Capital Stock held by such Non-
Qualifying Holder shall be contributed to the Escrow Fund entirely in cash.

2.4 Adjustments.

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
prepare and deliver to Parent an estimated balance sheet of the Company as of
the Effective Time (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") and a statement of
the estimated Closing Working Capital Amount, derived from the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount"). The
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Amount shall be prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP using the same
practices, procedures, principles, classifications and methodologies applied
in the preparation of the Company Balance Sheet (including with respect to the
establishing of reserves). The Company shall provide Parent and its accounting
and financial staff, auditors and advisors reasonable access to the books and
records of the Company and its accounting and financial staff in connection
with Parent's review thereof. The Company will review any comments on the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount made by Parent and will consider, in
good faith, any appropriate changes.

(b) On the Closing Date, (i) if the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount
is less than the Working Capital Upper Threshold and greater than the Working
Capital Lower Threshold, the Adjusted Transaction Value will not be increased
or decreased, (ii) if the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount is greater
than the Working Capital Upper Threshold, the Adjusted Transaction Value will
be increased by the amount by which the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Amount is greater than the Working Capital Upper Threshold, and (iii) if the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount is less than the Working Capital
Lower Threshold, the Adjusted Transaction Value will be decreased by the
amount by which the Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than the Working
Capital Lower Threshold. The Adjusted Transaction Value, as adjusted pursuant
to this Section 2.4(b), is referred to herein as the "Estimated Adjusted
Transaction Value."

(c) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Representative, as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than
90 days following the Closing Date, a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a statement
of the Closing Working Capital Amount derived from the Closing Balance Sheet
(the "Closing Working Capital Statement"). The Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
using the same practices, procedures, principles, classifications and
methodologies applied in the preparation of the Company Balance Sheet
(including with respect to the establishing of reserves).

(d) The Representative shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Closing
Working Capital Statement (the "Objection Period") to review the Closing
Working Capital Statement. Parent shall grant the Representative access at
reasonable times and places and upon reasonable advance notice to all books,
records and employees of the Surviving Corporation as reasonably requested by
the Representative in connection with its review of the Closing Working
Capital Statement. Upon the expiration of the Objection Period, the
Representative, on behalf of all Company Stockholders, shall be deemed to have
accepted, and shall be bound by, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the
calculation therein of the Closing Working Capital Amount, unless the
Representative shall have informed Parent in writing of its disagreement with
the Closing Working Capital Statement prior to the expiration of the Objection
Period (the "Objection"), specifying each disputed item and setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for each such dispute (each, a "Disputed Item").
Parent shall have 30 days from the date on which it receives the Objection
(the date on which such 30 day period ends, the "Response Date") to review and
respond to such Objection. If Parent and the Representative are able to
negotiate a mutually agreeable resolution of each Disputed Item, and each
signs a certificate to that effect, the Closing Working Capital Statement and
the calculation therein of the Closing Working Capital Amount, as adjusted to
reflect such resolution, shall be deemed final, non-appealable and binding for
purposes of this Agreement. If any Disputed Items have not been resolved by
the Response Date, either Parent or the Representative may refer such Disputed
Items to an independent, mutually agreeable, nationally recognized public
accounting firm (the "Accounting Referee") who shall accept its appointment
within seven days after such referral, to make a final, non-appealable and
binding determination as to such remaining Disputed Items pursuant to the
terms hereof. The Accounting Referee shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator. The Accounting Referee shall be directed to make a determination
of the Disputed Items in accordance with Section 2.4(e) promptly, but no later
than 30 days, after acceptance of its appointment. Parent and the
Representative agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to effect
the selection and appointment of the Accounting Referee pursuant to this
Section 2.4(d), including executing an engagement agreement with the
Accounting Referee providing for reasonable and customary compensation and
other terms of such engagement. Parent and the Representative shall make
readily available to the Accounting Referee all relevant books, records and
employees of the Company and the Surviving Corporation that are reasonably
requested by the Accounting Referee in connection with the Accounting
Referee's review of any Disputed Items.

(e) If Disputed Items are referred to the Accounting Referee for resolution
pursuant to Section 2.4(d), the Accounting Referee shall determine only with
respect to the Disputed Items submitted whether and to what extent, if any,
the Closing Working Capital Amount set forth in the Closing Working Capital
Statement requires adjustment. With respect to each Disputed Item, the
Accounting Referee's determination shall be within the range of values
assigned to such Disputed Item by Parent and the Representative. Any finding
by the Accounting Referee shall be (i) a reasoned award stating in reasonable
detail the findings of fact on which it is based, (ii) final, non-appealable
and binding upon the parties hereto and (iii) the sole and exclusive remedy
between the parties hereto regarding the Disputed Items so presented. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by Parent and the
Representative (on behalf of the Company Stockholders and the Indemnifying
Optionholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) in the same
proportion that the dollar amount of Disputed Items which are not resolved in
favor of Parent or the Representative, as applicable, bears to the total
dollar amount of Disputed Items resolved by the Accounting Referee. Each of
Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the Company Stockholders and the
Indemnifying Optionholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares) shall bear the fees, costs and expenses of its own accountants and all
of its other expenses incurred in connection with matters contemplated by this
Section 2.4.

(f) Payment of the Adjustments.

(i) Payment of the adjustments as contemplated by this Section 2.4(f) shall be
made (A) if no Objection is made by the Representative during the Objection
Period, within five Business Days following the expiration of the Objection
Period or (B) if the Representative submits an Objection within the Objection
Period, within five Business Days following final resolution of all Disputed
Items by either Parent and the Representative or the Accounting Referee.

(ii) If, upon the final determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount as
provided in Section 2.4(d) or 2.4(e), the Closing Working Capital Amount is
greater than the Working Capital Upper Threshold, Parent shall promptly
deliver, or cause to be delivered, an aggregate amount in cash equal to such
excess to (A) the Exchange Agent for payment to the Company Stockholders in
accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement and (B) to the Surviving
Corporation or an Affiliate thereof, for subsequent release to the
Indemnifying Optionholders as part of the second regularly scheduled payroll
cycle of the Surviving Corporation or such Affiliate following such release .
Subject to Section 9.9, any such amounts shall be promptly distributed to the
Company Stockholders and the Indemnifying Optionholders in accordance with
each their respective Pro Rata Shares.

(iii) If, upon the final determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount
as provided in Section 2.4(d) or 2.4(e), the Closing Working Capital Amount is
less than the Working Capital Lower Threshold, the Representative and Parent
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release an amount in cash equal to such
difference from the Escrow Fund to Parent.

(iv) The Estimated Adjusted Transaction Value as adjusted by this Section 2.4
is referred to herein as the "Final Adjusted Transaction Value."

(v) Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be treated for all Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Adjusted Transaction Value.

2.5 Escrow; Expense Fund.

(a) Escrow Amount. At the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold the Escrow
Amount from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Section
2.1(c), Section 2.1(e), Section 2.1(g) and Section 2.2(b) to the Non-
Dissenting Stockholders and the Indemnifying Optionholders. As promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Closing, Parent shall deposit in escrow
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement: (A) an amount in cash equal to seventy-five
percent (75%) of the Escrow Amount (the "Escrow Cash") and (B) a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1)(aa) the Escrow
Amount, minus (bb) the Escrow Cash, divided by (2) the Average Trading Price
(the "Escrow Shares"). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
deposited in escrow under this Section 2.5(a) shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.

(b) Escrow Agreement. Prior to the Closing, Parent, the Representative and the
Escrow Agent shall enter into an escrow agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "Escrow Agreement"). At or promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
Escrow Agent the Escrow Cash and issue, or cause its transfer agent to issue,
a book entry position registered in the name of the Escrow Agent or its
nominee representing the Escrow Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.5(a).
The Escrow Cash and the Escrow Shares (collectively, the "Escrow Fund") shall
be held by the Escrow Agent as partial security for the indemnification
obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under this Agreement in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow
Agreement, and the Escrow Fund shall be subject to reduction for Claims as
provided in Article 9. Each Indemnifying Party's rights, if any, to receive
amounts from the Escrow Fund are non-transferable and non-assignable.

(c) Expense Fund Amount. Notwithstanding the terms of Sections 2.1(c), 2.1(e),
2.1(g) and Section 2.2(b): (i) at the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold
the Expense Fund Amount from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(e), Section 2.1(g) and Section 2.2(b)
to the Non-Dissenting Stockholders and the Indemnifying Optionholders; and
(ii) at or as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing, Parent
shall make, or cause to be made, payment of an amount in cash equal to the
Expense Fund Amount by wire transfer to a segregated client bank account
maintained by the Representative, to be held in such segregated client bank
account and distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The
Expense Fund Amount as contemplated herein shall reflect a proportionate
contribution from each Non-Dissenting Stockholder and the Indemnifying
Optionholders in an amount equal to such Person's Pro Rata Share of such
amount.

(d) Tax. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Amount is intended
to be part of the aggregate acquisition consideration payable in exchange for
Company Capital Stock in accordance with this Agreement. Accordingly, except
with respect to interest imputed under Sections 483 or 1274 of the Code, the
parties agree to report payments of the Escrow Amount for U.S. federal and
state and foreign income Tax purposes consistent with such treatment unless
otherwise required by Law.

2.6 The Closing. Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article 8, the Closing shall take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP, 201 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood Shores, California, 94065, at
10:00 a.m. Pacific time on the Closing Date. On the Closing Date or at such
later date and time as may be mutually agreed in writing by the Company and
Parent, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger, in customary form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent (the "Certificate of Merger"), with the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL (the
time of such filing and acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger, shall be referred
to herein as the "Effective Time").

2.7 Effects of the Merger. At and upon the Effective Time:

(a) The separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation of the Merger pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Certificate of Merger. The effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, all the property, rights,

(b) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or any other Person, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended to read in its
entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except the name shall remain Nexmo
Inc. and the provisions relating to the incorporator shall be omitted), and as
so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(c) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or any other Person, the bylaws
of the Company shall be amended to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in

Merger Sub shall be changed to refer to Nexmo Inc.), and as so amended shall
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(d) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
become the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time, each to hold office until their respective successors are duly
appointed or until their earlier death, resignation or removal, in each case
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

(e) The members of the board of directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall become the members of the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold

in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

2.8 Exchange.

(a) At or promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited: (i) with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company or such
other Person as Parent may select (the "Exchange Agent") (A) for the benefit
of the Company Stockholders, an amount in cash equal to (1) the Cash
Consideration, minus (2) the Withholding Options Closing Payment, minus (3)
the Indemnifying Optionholder Cash Amount, minus (4) the Escrow Amount, minus
(5) the aggregate EMI Option Amount for all Vested EMI Options that are
exercised in accordance with Section 2.2(d), and (B) for the benefit of the
Company Stockholders and the Indemnifying Optionholders, the Stock
Consideration, in the form of certificates of Parent Common Stock issued in
the name of each Qualifying Holder, to be held by the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the terms of the exchange agent agreement (the "Exchange Agent
Agreement") to be executed prior to the Closing by Parent and the Exchange
Agent; provided, that Parent shall not deposit with the Exchange Agent any
portion of the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration retained by
Parent pursuant to the terms of any Management Holder's Support Agreement,
which amounts shall be paid out (if at all) in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Support Agreement; and (ii) with the Surviving Corporation, (A)
for the benefit of the Company Optionholders (other than the Indemnifying
Optionholders) who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, hold
Company Options with respect to which the Company has Tax withholding
obligations ("Withholding Options") that are not Underwater Options, an amount
(such amount, the "Withholding Options Closing Payment") equal to the portion
of the Aggregate Cash Option Payment attributable to such Withholding Options,
which shall be distributed in accordance with Section 2.2(a), and (B) for the
benefit of the Indemnifying Optionholders, an amount equal to the Aggregate
Indemnifying Option Cash Payment, which shall be distributed in accordance
with Section 2.2(b).

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, to each Company
Stockholder who holds a certificate or certificates that, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Capital Stock (the
"Certificates") a letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit G (a "Letter of Transmittal"). Parent shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Closing, to any Company Stockholder who delivers a duly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal (together with the Certificate(s) from the
Company Stockholders for cancellation or an affidavit of loss as described in
Section 2.8(d) below and any other documents as Parent shall reasonably
require), the Merger Consideration that such Company Stockholder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(e) and Section 2.1(g), in
each case without interest thereon.

(c) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued to Company Stockholders or Indemnifying Optionholders
under this Agreement, and such former Company Stockholders shall not be
entitled to any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or
distributions or other rights as a stockholder of Parent with respect to any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that would have otherwise been issued
to such former Company Stockholders or Indemnifying Optionholders.

(d) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Exchange Agent
shall, as promptly as practicable following the receipt by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, of such affidavit, issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
represented by the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in exchange therefor
that the Company Stockholder has the right to receive. Parent may in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide to Parent an
indemnity agreement against any claim that may be made against Parent with
respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, no shares of Company Capital Stock will
be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of Certificates formerly representing
such Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
except as provided herein or by Law.

(f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and no transfer of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth in the
Spreadsheet are presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any other amount
payable with respect to such Company Capital Stock in accordance with Section
2.1(c), Section 2.1(e) and Section 2.1(g), subject to the terms of Section
2.4, Section 2.5 and this Section 2.8.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent or any of its
Affiliates be required to pay an amount in excess of $230,000,000, plus any
amount payable by Parent pursuant to Section 2.4(f)(ii), plus the Variable
Payout Amount (if any) under this Agreement.

2.9 Dissenting Shares. If, in connection with the Merger, holders of Company
Capital Stock shall have demanded and perfected their appraisal rights in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, none of such Dissenting Shares shall
be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to the holder of such Dissenting Shares as provided in Section 2.1(c),
Section 2.1(e) and Section 2.1(g), but shall instead be converted into the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL, becomes
entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares shall receive payment
therefor in accordance with the DGCL (but only after the value therefor shall
have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to the DGCL). In the
event that any Company Stockholder fails to make an effective demand for
payment or fails to perfect its appraisal rights as to its shares of Company
Capital Stock or any Dissenting Shares shall otherwise lose their status as
Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be converted into
the right to receive the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c),
Section 2.1(e) and Section 2.1(g) in respect of such shares as if such shares
had never been Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall deliver to the holder
thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable after) the applicable
time or times specified in Section 2.8, following the satisfaction of the
applicable Payment Conditions, the Merger Consideration to which such Company
Stockholder would have been entitled under Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(e) and
Section 2.1(g) with respect to such shares. The Company shall give Parent (a)
prompt written notice (and in no event more than two Business Days) of (i) any
demand received by the Company for appraisal of Company Capital Stock or
notice of exercise of a Company Stockholder's appraisal rights in accordance
with the DGCL and (ii) the withdrawals of such demands and (b) the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company agrees that, except with Parent's prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), it shall not voluntarily
make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demand for appraisal or exercise of appraisal rights
(it being understood that if Parent requires the Company and the
Representative to agree in writing, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties,
that any such payment will be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.2(e) (to the
extent such payment, together with the amount such Company Stockholder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Article 2 upon the exchange of the shares of
Company Capital Stock held by such Company Stockholder, exceeds the value of
the amount that otherwise would have been payable pursuant to Article 2 upon
the exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock held by such Company
Stockholder), such requirement shall not be deemed to be unreasonable).

2.10 Tax Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause
to be deducted and withheld, from the Merger Consideration or any other
payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including the Escrow
Amount) or any Equity Release Agreement, the amounts required to be deducted,
withheld and/or paid or accounted for under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law (including, for the avoidance of doubt, and to
the extent legally permissible, employer's National Insurance contributions),
with respect to the making of such payment and, to the extent that amounts are
so deducted, withheld, accounted for and/or paid over to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made. The parties agree to cooperate to allow Parent, at
its election, to effectuate such withholding by means acceptable to Parent,
including by paying the applicable Merger Consideration for which such
withholding is required to the Surviving Corporation and causing the Surviving
Corporation to withhold the applicable amounts through the Surviving
Corporation's payroll system. Except for such withholding rights, the
recipient of any payments payable pursuant to this Agreement is solely
responsible for any and all Liabilities for Taxes that may arise with respect
to any Merger Consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement.

2.11 Further Assurances. If, at any time before or after the Effective Time,
any of the parties hereto reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary to
consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors shall
execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary to consummate the
Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

2.12 Variable Payout.

(a) The Participating Holders may be entitled to receive additional,
contingent consideration upon the determination of the Average Company
Revenue, as follows:

(i) if the Average Company Revenue is less than or equal to (A) the Revenue
Benchmark Amount minus (B) Maximum Monthly Variable Payout Amount, then the
"Variable Payout Amount" shall equal zero ($0);

(ii) if the Average Company Revenue is (A) greater than the Revenue Benchmark
Amount, minus the Maximum Monthly Variable Payout Amount and (B) less than one
hundred percent (100%) of the Revenue Benchmark Amount, then the "Variable
Payout Amount" shall equal: (1) $20,000,000, minus (2) the product of (x) the
difference between the Revenue Benchmark Amount and Average Company Revenue,
multiplied by (y) twelve; and

(iii) if the Average Company Revenue is greater than or equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of the Revenue Benchmark Amount, then the "Variable Payout
Amount" shall equal $20,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
the Variable Payout Amount exceed $20,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt,
attached hereto as Schedule 2.12(a) is an illustrative calculation of the
Variable Payout Amount.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the revenue of the Acquired Companies
for the calendar year ended December 31, 2016 is less than $90,000,000, then
the Variable Payout Amount shall equal zero ($0). For the avoidance of doubt,
the Company's revenue shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied and in accordance with the accounting and revenue recognition policies
of the Company as of March 31, 2016, including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the categorization of customers as retail or trading customers.

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.12, Parent shall, no
later than September 30, 2017, pay or cause to be paid to (i) the Exchange
Agent for further distribution to each Participating Holder in respect of each
share of Company Capital Stock held by such Participating Holder as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (if any), an amount in cash equal to
(A) the Payout Specified Fraction with respect to such share of Company
Capital Stock, multiplied by (B) (1) the Variable Payout Amount, minus (2) the
G2020 Fee; and (ii) to G2020, the G2020 Fee; provided, however, that if the
Representative delivers an Initial Objection Notice or a Final Objection
Notice to Parent in accordance with Section 2.12(f), then Parent shall make
any payments required under this Section 2.12(c) within five Business Days
after the dispute identified in such Initial Objection Notice or Final
Objection Notice, as the case may be, is resolved. Parent shall be entitled to
rely upon the amount of the G2020 Fee and the wire instructions as provided by
the Representative in Section 2.12(f).

(d)

(i) In lieu of paying any portion of the Variable Payout Amount in cash,
Parent may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay all or any portion of such
Variable Payout Amount (such portion, expressed as a dollar amount, the "Share
Allocated Variable Payout Portion") in the form of shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.12(d) (each such
payment, a "Share Issuance" and such election to make a Share Issuance, a
"Share Issuance Election"). If a Share Issuance Election is made, then (A)
each Participating Holder shall promptly execute and deliver a customary
subscription agreement with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Share Issuance, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, which shall contain representations and share legend provisions
consistent with the Investment Representation Letter, and (B) each
Participating Holder shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and any of its
Affiliates in effecting the Share Issuance.

(ii) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.12(d), if a Share
Issuance Election is made with respect to any Variable Payout Amount, then, on
or prior to the date on which such Variable Payout Amount is due to be paid by
Parent, Parent shall: (A) issue to each Participating Holder, with respect to
each Participating Share held by such Participating Holder that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to: (1) the Payout Specified Fraction with respect
to such Participating Share, multiplied by (2) the Share Allocated Variable
Payout Portion, divided by (3) the Specified Trading Price, and deliver such
shares of Parent Common Stock to the Exchange Agent for further distribution
to the Participating Holders in accordance with Section 2.12(b); and (B)
reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise have been payable in respect of
such share pursuant to Section 2.12(b) by subtracting from such amount the
amount referred to in clause (A) of this sentence, it being understood that
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to any Participating
Holder pursuant to this Section 2.12(d)(ii) shall be determined after
aggregating all fractions of a share issuable to such Participating Holder
with any fractional share remaining after such aggregation to be paid in cash
based on the Specified Trading Price. Parent shall ensure that any shares of
Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to a Share Issuance Election are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of any
Encumbrances created by Parent, including that such shares will not bear a
legend restricting their trading under Rule 144 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section
2.12(d)(ii), if the Representative delivers an Initial Objection Notice or a
Final Objection Notice to Parent in accordance with Section 2.12(f), then any
payments or Share Issuances required under this Section 2.12(d) shall be made
to the Participating Holders within five Business Days after the dispute
identified in such Initial Objection Notice or a Final Objection Notice, as
the case may be, is resolved.

(iv) Notwithstanding any Share Issuance Election made by Parent, with respect
to any Participating Holder who is a Non-Qualifying Holder (or with respect to
whom Parent does not have a reasonable belief that such Participating Holder
is an Accredited Investor), such Participating Holder shall, at the option of
Parent, in its sole discretion, in lieu of the shares of Parent Common Stock
to which such Participating Holder would otherwise have been entitled under
this Section 2.12(d), receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the Specified
Trading Price, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
to which such Participating Holder would otherwise have been entitled to
receive under this Section 2.12(d).

(e) On or before July 31, 2017, Parent shall (i) prepare or cause to be
prepared a statement (the "Variable Payout Statement") setting forth the
Variable Payout Amount that Parent believes is due in accordance with Section
2.12 and (ii) deliver or cause to be delivered such Variable Payout Statement
to the Representative for and on behalf of the Participating Holders.

(f) In the event that the Representative objects to Parent's calculation of
the Variable Payout Amount set forth in a Variable Payout Statement or
requires further information in order to perform such calculations or
determine such amount, then within 30 days after the delivery to the
Representative of such Variable Payout Statement (the "Initial Response
Period"), the Representative shall deliver to Parent a written notice (an
"Initial Objection Notice"): (i) describing in reasonable detail the
Representative's objections to Parent's calculation of the amounts set forth
in such statement and containing a statement setting forth the Variable Payout
Amount determined by the Representative to be correct; or (ii) requesting
additional information from Parent that the Representative deems reasonably
necessary in order to perform such calculations or determine such amount
(which information, to the extent reasonably necessary in order to perform
such calculations, shall be provided by Parent within 15 days after Parent's
receipt of such request). If the Representative does not deliver an Initial
Objection Notice to Parent during the Initial Response Period, then Parent's
calculation of the amounts set forth in the Variable Payout Statement shall be
deemed conclusive and binding on Parent, the Participating Holders and the
Representative. If the Representative delivers an Initial Objection Notice to
Parent accompanied by a request for additional information from Parent during
the Initial Response Period, as described above, then the Representative shall
have an additional 30 days after receiving from Parent all of the information
requested by the Representative (such 30 day period, the "Final Response
Period") to deliver to Parent a written notice (a "Final Objection Notice")
describing in reasonable detail the Representative's objections to Parent's
calculations of the amounts set forth in such Variable Payout Statement
accompanied by a statement setting forth the Variable Payout Amount determined
by the Representative to be correct. If the Representative has requested
additional information in an Initial Objection Notice delivered during the
Initial Response Period and does not deliver a Final Objection Notice to
Parent during the Final Response Period, then Parent's calculation of the
amounts set forth in the Variable Payout Statement shall be deemed conclusive
and binding on Parent, the Participating Holders and the Representative. If
the Representative delivers an Initial Objection Notice or Final Objection
Notice, as the case may be, accompanied by a statement setting forth the
Variable Payout Amount determined by the Representative to be correct to
Parent during either the Initial Response Period or the Final Response Period
in accordance with this Section 2.12(f), and if the Representative and Parent
are unable to agree upon the calculation of the amounts set forth in the
Variable Payout Statement within 30 days after such Initial Objection Notice
or Final Objection Notice, as the case may be, is delivered to Parent, the
dispute shall be finally settled by the Accounting Referee. In reviewing the
differences with respect to matters specified in the Initial Objection Notice
or Final Objection Notice, the Accounting Referee shall (i) consider only
those items or amounts disputed by the Representative in the Initial Objection
Notice or Final Objection Notice which remain in dispute, (ii) shall not
assign a value to any item or amount in dispute greater than the greatest
value for such item or amount assigned by the Representative, on the one hand,
or Parent, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item or
amount assigned by the Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the
other hand and (iii) shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by Parent and the
Representative (on behalf of the Participating Holders) in the same proportion
that the dollar amount of items set forth in the Initial Objection Notice or
Final Objection Notice which are not resolved in favor of Parent or the
Representative, as applicable, bear to the total dollar amount of items set
forth in such notice that are resolved by the Accounting Referee. Each of
Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the Participating Holders) shall
bear the fees, costs and expenses of its own accountants and all of its other
expenses incurred in connection with matters contemplated by this Section
2.12. No later than two Business Days following the final determination of the
Variable Payout Amount pursuant to this Section 2.12, the Representative shall
deliver to Parent a statement setting forth the amount of the Transaction Fees
owed to G2020, if any, in connection with the achievement of the Variable
Payout Amount (the "G2020 Fee"), together with wire instructions for the
payment thereof; provided, that the G2020 Fee shall not exceed the Variable
Payout Amount.

(g) No right or interest of any Participating Holder under this Section 2.12
may be assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, in whole or in part,
other than pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution or by will.

(h) On and after the Closing, Parent shall have sole and absolute discretion
with regard to all matters relating to the operation of the Company Business
and the Acquired Companies; provided, that from the Effective Time through May
31, 2017, except to the extent the Representative has granted its written
consent (such consent to be exercised in its sole discretion), (i) Parent
shall cause the Acquired Companies to be operated in a manner that complies in
all material respects with applicable Law and (ii) Parent shall not
intentionally take any actions that have the primary purpose of avoiding,
reducing or preventing the achievement or attainment of the Variable Payout
Amount.

(i) In the event that, at any time prior to May 31, 2017, (i) there occurs a
liquidation or dissolution of the Surviving Company or Parent other than into
an Affiliate of Parent, (ii) there occurs a sale, outbound exclusive license
or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Surviving
Company or Parent to a Person that is not an Affiliate of Parent in one or a
series of transactions, (iii) there occurs a merger, reorganization,
consolidation or share exchange in which the outstanding shares of the
Surviving Company's or Parent's capital stock are cancelled, converted into or
exchanged for a different kind of securities of the successor entity and the
successor entity is not an Affiliate of Parent, (iv) there occurs an
acquisition of all or substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of
the Surviving Company or Parent by a Person that is not an Affiliate of
Parent, or (v) Parent elects, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the
payment of the Variable Payout Amount, then the Variable Payout Amount of
$20,000,000 shall become due and payable immediately (less the amount of the
G2020 Fee, which shall become due and payable to G2020).

(j) For purposes of Section 2.12, the following terms shall have the meaning
set forth below:

(i) "Average Company Revenue" means the average monthly revenue of the Company
(determined on a calendar month basis) generated from the Top 100 Customers
for the twelve month period ending May 31, 2017, as calculated in accordance

may be, with respect to such share of Company Capital Stock (including, in
each case, amounts to be contributed to the Escrow Fund with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 2.5), and having a denominator equal to the aggregate
amount of Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), Section
2.1(e), Section 2.1(g) or Section 2.2(b) in respect of all shares of Company

federal and state and foreign income Tax purposes consistent with such
treatment unless otherwise required by Law.

taken all action necessary (under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise) to
effectuate the provisions of this Agreement as it relates to Company Options,
and to ensure that, from and after the Closing, each holder of any EMI Options
shall cease to have (and, as of the Closing, no holder of any such EMI Options

Closing Date, entered into joint elections with all holders of EMI Options for
such holders to assume the liability for any employer's National Insurance
contributions arising in respect of the exercise or settlement of such
options. Other than the Company Stock Plan, none of the Acquired Companies has

right, co-sale right or other similar restriction applicable to any
outstanding security of any of the Acquired Companies.

granted (a "Promised Option"), or other security has not been issued (each, a
"Specified Person"), together with the number of Promised Options allocated to
each such Person.

3.5 No Conflict. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any
of the Company Ancillary Agreements by the Company, nor the consummation of
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, shall
conflict with, result in a termination, breach, violation of (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both), acceleration of any obligation or loss of
any material benefit, or constitute a default, or require the consent,
release, waiver or approval of, or notice to, any third party, under: (a) any
provision of any Charter Documents of any Acquired Company, each as currently
in effect, (b) any Law applicable to any Acquired Company or any of its assets
or properties, (c) any Company Material Contract, (d) any Governmental Permit,
(e) any privacy policy of any Acquired Company, or (f) any judgment, decree or
order to which any Acquired Company is subject except, in the case of each of
clauses (b), (d) and (f), where such conflict, termination, breach, violation,
acceleration or default would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability to the Acquired
Companies, taken as a whole.

3.6 Litigation. As of the Agreement Date, there is no Action pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against any of the Acquired
Companies (or against any officer, director, employee or agent of any of the
Acquired Companies in their capacity as such or relating to their employment,
services or relationship with such Acquired Company). There is no judgment,
decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Authority, arbitrator or
mediator outstanding against any of the Acquired Companies. To the Knowledge
of the Company, as of the Agreement Date there is no reasonable basis for any
Person to assert a claim against any of the Acquired Companies based upon the
Company's entering into this Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement or
consummating the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement. No Acquired Company has any
Action pending against any Governmental Authority or other Person.

completed and fully resolved to the satisfaction of the applicable
Governmental Authority conducting such audit and any Taxes determined by such

as defined in Sections 6662, 6011, 6012 or 6111 of the Code or the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

(l) Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.

(i) Each "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" under which any of the
Acquired Companies makes, is obligated to make or promises to make, payments
subject to Section 409A of the Code, if any, is in compliance with Section
409A of the Code, and the applicable Treasury Regulations and IRS guidance
thereunder so as to avoid any Tax pursuant to Section 409A of the Code and the
document or documents that evidence each such plan conforms to the provisions
of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. No
payment pursuant to any arrangement between any of the Acquired Companies and
any "service provider" (as such term is defined in Section 409A of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) would subject any Person to a Tax
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, whether pursuant to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise. No Company
Benefit Arrangement or other Contract provides a gross-up, reimbursement or
other indemnification for any Tax or related interest or penalty that may be
imposed for failure to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code.

(ii) All Company Options have been authorized by the board of directors of the
Company or an appropriate committee thereof, and, if required, approved by
stockholders of the Company by the necessary number of votes or written
consent, including approval of the option exercise price or the methodology
for determining the Company Option exercise price and the substantive option
terms. Each Company Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option"
under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies. No Company Option has been
retroactively granted, or the exercise price of any Company Option determined
retroactively. No Company Option or other right to acquire Company Common
Stock or other equity of any of the Acquired Companies (A) has an exercise
price less than the fair market value of a share of the underlying stock as of
the date such Company Option or right was granted as determined in accordance
with Section 409A of the Code, (B) has any feature for the deferral of
compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later
of exercise or disposition of such Company Option or right, or (C) has been
granted with respect to any class of stock of any of the Acquired Companies
that is not "service recipient stock" (within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder). The Company has, or will
have as at the Closing Date, entered into joint elections with all holders of
enterprise management incentive options under the Company's Stock Plan for
such holders to assume (to the extent legally permissible) the liability for
any employer's National Insurance contributions arising in respect of the
exercise or settlement of such options.

(m) Additional Tax Representations. None of the Acquired Companies has ever
entered into any Contract or maintained any Company Benefit Arrangement that
would give rise to payments with respect to the performance of services that
are nondeductible under Section 280G of the Code or subject to the excise Tax
under Section 4999 of the Code, and neither the execution of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either
alone or upon occurrence of any additional event) result in the payment of any
amount that would, individually or in combination with any other payment,
constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code). There is no Company Benefit Arrangement or other Contract by which
any of the Acquired Companies is bound to compensate any employee of such
Acquired Company or other service provider of such Acquired Company for any
excise Tax or related interest or penalty paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code.

(n) HM Revenue and Customs were notified of the grant of all enterprise
management incentive options under the UK Addendum to the Company's 2011 Stock
Plan within the required time limit under paragraph 44 of Schedule 5 of the
ITEPA and the UK Addendum to the Company's 2011 Stock Plan and all enterprise
management incentive options granted thereunder fully comply with all
requirements and conditions set out in Schedule 5 of the ITEPA.

(o) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Acquired Companies
make no representations or warranties as to the amount, value or condition of,

title and interest in and to (i) all Registered Company Intellectual Property

disclosure, candor and good faith in connection with each Patent filed by such
Acquired Company. (iv) To the Knowledge of the Company, all prior art material
to the patentability of the claims in any issued or applied for Patents of any

proceeding.

(h) Neither the conduct of the Company Business nor any Company Offering
(including the use, practice, offering, licensing, provision, sale,
distribution, making available, or other exploitation of any Company Offering)

misappropriation of), diluting, using or disclosing without authorization, or
otherwise violating (and, when conducted following the Closing in the same
manner or solely with respect to the Company Offerings, as proposed by the
Acquired Companies to be conducted as of the Agreement Date and as of the
Closing Date) any Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person, (ii) has
been or is contributing to or inducing (and, when conducted following the
Closing in the same manner or, solely with respect to the Company Offerings,

and as of the Closing Date, will not and would not contribute to or induce)
any infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of any Intellectual
Property Rights of any third Person, or (iii) has been or is constituting
(and, when conducted following the Closing in the same manner or, solely with
respect to the Company Offerings, as proposed by the Acquired Companies to be
conducted as of the Agreement Date and as of the Closing Date, will not and
would not constitute) unfair competition or trade practices under the Laws of
any relevant jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company is not
making any representation or warranty under this Section 3.14(h) that any non-
Software content that constitutes Licensed IP and is uploaded by an end-user
customer of an Acquired Company's online, hosted service to that service, in
the form uploaded to any of the Acquired Companies, itself does not infringe,
misappropriate or violate the Intellectual Property Rights of such individual
or any third Person, so long as the applicable Acquired Company is complying
with the applicable in-bound license restrictions to which it may be bound
with respect thereto.

(i) None of the Acquired Companies has received any written (or, to the

(j) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person is infringing,
misappropriating, misusing, diluting or violating any Company Intellectual
Property Rights, Company Technology owned by or exclusively licensed to the
Company, or Company Offering. No Acquired Company has made any written or

obligation). No such material Proprietary Information has been authorized to
be disclosed or has been actually disclosed, in each case by or on behalf of
any of the Acquired Companies, to any Person other than pursuant to a written
confidentiality Contract restricting the disclosure and use of such
Proprietary Information other than (in the case of Proprietary Information

its employment or engagement with such Acquired Company (an "Invention
Assignment Agreement") in a form made available to Parent prior to the
Agreement Date. (i) No current or former employee or director of any of the
Acquired Companies has (A) affirmatively excluded any Technology (or any
Intellectual Property Rights in or to any Technology) authored, invented,
created, conceived, or otherwise developed prior to his or her or its
employment or engagement with such Acquired Company from his or her or its
assignment of inventions pursuant to such Person's Invention Assignment
Agreement or (B) failed to affirmatively indicate in such Invention Assignment
Agreement that no Technology authored, invented, created, conceived, or
otherwise developed by him or her or it prior to his or her or its employment
or engagement with such Acquired Company exists. (ii) To the Knowledge of the
Company, no current or former employee, contractor, or director of any of the
Acquired Companies has alleged to any of the Acquired Companies or any third
Person, ownership or other exclusive rights by such employee, contractor,
director, or consultant in any Technology authored, invented, created,
conceived or otherwise developed by such employee, contractor, director, or
consultant in the scope of his, her or its employment or engagement with such
Acquired Company. (iii) No current or former employee, contractor, or director
of any of the Acquired Companies has failed to effectively waive all moral
rights held by such employee, contractor, director, or consultant in any
Technology authored, invented, created, conceived or otherwise developed by
such employee, contractor, director, or consultant in the scope of his, her or
its employment or engagement with such Acquired Company in favor of such
applicable Acquired Company. Schedule 3.14(k)(v) of the Company Disclosure

Person was employed or otherwise engaged to perform work for any Acquired
Company.

(l) Schedule 3.14(l) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and

the Acquired Companies to enter into a source code escrow Contract or other
Contract) requiring the deposit of any source code or related materials for
any Company Software.

(m) Schedule 3.14(m) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list (in
the format requested by Parent) of all Open Source Software that is included,
incorporated or embedded in, linked to, combined or distributed or made
available with any Company Offering, other than any non-Software content that
constitutes Licensed IP and is uploaded by an end-user customer of an Acquired
Company's online, hosted service to that service, in the form uploaded to any
of the Acquired Companies. Each of the Acquired Companies fully complies with
all license terms applicable to any item of Open Source Software disclosed, or

Letter.

(n) No Open Source Software is or has been included, incorporated or embedded
in, linked to, combined or distributed or made available with or used in the
delivery or provision of any Company Software or any Company Offering, in each
case, by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Companies, in a manner that (i)

any rights in or to, any Owned Company IP.

(q) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not result in the loss or impairment of any right of the Acquired Companies to
own, use, practice or otherwise exploit any Owned Company IP. The consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not conflict with,
result in a termination, breach, violation of (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both), acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material
benefit, or constitute a default, or require the consent, release, waiver or
approval of, or notice to, any third party, under any Contract that includes
any grant of an Intellectual Property License to any of the Acquired Companies
by any other Person of any Intellectual Property Rights or Technology. Neither
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any Company
Ancillary Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement will, pursuant to any
Contract to which any of the Acquired Companies is a party or otherwise bound,
result (or purport to result) in the transfer or grant by any of the Acquired

interest or Intellectual Property License with respect to any Company
Intellectual Property Rights or Company Technology or any Intellectual
Property Rights or Technology of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

(t) To the extent that any "disqualified individual" with respect to the
Company or any of its Affiliates (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the
Code and the regulations thereunder) would receive any payment or benefit that
would reasonably be expected to constitute "parachute payments" (within the

then, the Company shall (i) no later than three Business Days prior to the
Closing, solicit, and use commercially reasonable efforts to secure, from each
such "disqualified individual" a waiver (the "Parachute Payment Waiver") of
such disqualified individual's right to some or all of such payment or benefit

shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section

individual" to receive the Waived 280G Benefits. The Company shall provide
drafts of any such waivers and disclosure and approval materials to Parent for
its review and approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,

Parent such information in a manner that does not result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege). The Company shall direct its accountants to

termination of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article 8,
Parent covenants and agrees with the Company as follows:

6.1 Advise of Changes. Parent shall promptly advise the Company in writing of
(a) any event occurring subsequent to the Agreement Date that would render any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in Article 4

reasonably be expected to not be satisfied, or (b) any breach of any covenant
or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, any Parent

the execution and filing of, any application, notification or other document
that may be necessary in order to obtain the authorization, approval or
consent of any Governmental Authority, whether foreign, federal, state, local

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Parent
Ancillary Agreement or any Merger Sub Ancillary Agreement. Parent shall make
all filings required of it under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby within three Business Days of the Agreement Date and to
the extent necessary, respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
formal or informal request under the HSR Act for additional information,
documents or other materials received from the Federal Trade Commission,
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority acting pursuant to
its antitrust authority. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all such authorizations, approvals and consents. Subject to applicable
Laws and orders, Parent shall promptly inform the Company of any communication
between Parent and any Governmental Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. If Parent receives any formal or informal
request for supplemental information or documentary material from any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
then Parent shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably

in good faith and cooperate with the Company in advance of any such written or
oral communication to any Governmental Authority. Parent shall, and shall

resolve questions or objections, if any, of any Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Action is
instituted (or threatened in writing to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law, it is
expressly understood and agreed that neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be under any obligation to: (a) litigate or
contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, or (b) make proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to
orders providing for (i) the sale, divestiture or other disposition or holding

conduct their business or own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full
rights of ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock.

efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all of the conditions precedent
set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3, and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

6.4 Indemnification of Company Directors and Officers.

(u) If the Merger is consummated, then until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of the Acquired Companies to their
present and former directors and officers (the "Company Indemnified Parties")
pursuant to indemnification agreements with the Acquired Companies in effect
on the Agreement Date and identified on Schedule 6.4(a) and pursuant to the
Charter Documents, as in effect on the Agreement Date (the "Company
Indemnification Provisions"), in each case, with respect to claims arising out
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time which are
asserted after the Effective Time. Any claims for indemnification made under
this Section 6.4(a) on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
shall survive such anniversary until the final resolution thereof. However,
the foregoing covenants under this Section 6.4(a) shall not apply to any claim
based on a claim for which an Indemnified Party has been determined to be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 9.

(v) Parent shall maintain (or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain) the
Insurance Coverage in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder during the term thereof; provided, however, that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay any
additional amounts following the Closing with respect to such Insurance
Coverage, including any additional amounts to maintain such Insurance
Coverage.

(w) This Section 6.4 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended
to benefit each Company Indemnified Party, shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable
by the Company Indemnified Parties (each of whom is an intended third party
beneficiary of this Section 6.4); provided, however, that recourse shall first
be against the Insurance Coverage until it is exhausted before recovery
against Parent under the Company Indemnification Provisions may take place.

(x) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made (if necessary) so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.

6.5 Continuation of Certain Company Benefit Arrangements.

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December

Company immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) annual target bonus
opportunities which are no less than the annual target bonus opportunities
provided by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii)

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan of Parent in which any Company
Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Closing Date
(collectively, "Parent Benefit Plans"), Parent shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to, recognize all service of
the Company Continuing Employees with the Acquired Companies as if such
service were with Parent or its Affiliates for purposes of vesting and
eligibility to participate in any Parent Benefit Plan; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply (i) to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits, (ii) to the extent prior service is not credited
to employees of Parent under such plans, (iii) for purposes of any equity-
based plans or (iv) with respect to benefit accrual under qualified and
nonqualified defined benefit pension plans. In addition, with respect to each
Parent Benefit Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA), Parent or its Affiliates shall (A) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be waived any pre-existing condition exclusion or waiting
periods that apply to the Company Continuing Employees, unless such conditions
would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company and its
Affiliates and (B) provide each Company Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents with credit for any eligible expenses incurred under any
Company Employee Plan for purposes of satisfying the co-payment, deductible
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the corresponding Parent Benefit Plans.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no employee of any of the Acquired Companies
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement and no provision of this Section 6.5 shall create such rights in any
such persons. Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee employment for any period of
time or preclude the ability of Parent, its Affiliates, any Acquired Company
or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment or service of any
Person at any time and for any reason, or (ii) require Parent, its Affiliates,
any Acquired Company or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company
Benefit Arrangement or other employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent
the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time,
or (iii) be treated as establishing or amending any employee benefit plan or
arrangement of Parent, any Acquired Company or any of their respective
Affiliates.

terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time if the other

of the Company contained in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and
the certificates of the Company delivered pursuant to Section 7.2, shall
survive the Effective Time and remain in full force and effect until the date
that is 18 months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that: (a) the
Specified Representations will remain operative and in full force and effect
until the 30th day following the expiration of the statute of limitations
applicable to the subject matter of such representation (or, if there is no
statute of limitations applicable to the subject matter of such
representation, until the Expiration Date), (b) no right to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement pursuant to this Article 9 in respect of any
claim based upon any failure of a representation or warranty to be true and
correct that is set forth in a Notice of Claim delivered in accordance with
Section 9.4 prior to the applicable expiration date of such representation or
warranty shall be affected by the expiration of such representation or
warranty, and (c) such expiration shall not affect the rights of any
Indemnified Party, under this Article 9 or otherwise, to seek recovery of
Damages arising out of any fraud, knowing and willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation until the 30th day following the expiration of the statute
of limitations applicable to such fraud, knowing and willful breach or
intentional misrepresentation. The representations and warranties of Parent

limitations with respect to such item shall be reduced to the shortened
survival period contemplated herein, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, Section 8106(c) of the DGCL does not apply.

9.2 Company Agreement to Indemnify. Each Company Stockholder and the
Indemnifying Optionholders (each, an "Indemnifying Party" and collectively,
the "Indemnifying Parties") shall severally (based on each such Indemnifying
Party's Pro Rata Share), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless each of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates, officers
and directors (each hereinafter referred to individually as an "Indemnified
Party" and collectively as the "Indemnified Parties") from and against, and
shall compensate and reimburse each of them for, any and all losses,
reductions in value (where determined to be an appropriate measure of
damages), costs, damages, lost profits (where determined to be an appropriate
measure of damages), liabilities, interest and expenses (including reasonable,
out-of-pocket attorneys' fees, other professionals' and experts' fees and

collectively referred to as "Damages") incurred by an Indemnified Party,
directly or indirectly, to the extent arising out of or resulting from:

(d) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter, to be true and correct as of
the Agreement Date or as of the Closing Date (as though such representation or
warranty were made as of the Closing Date rather than the Agreement Date,
except in the case of any individual representation and warranty which by its
terms speaks only as of a specific date or dates, in which case as though made
as of such specific date or dates) and any failure of any certification to be
made by the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(a) to be true and correct as of
the date such certificate shall be delivered to Parent (this Section 9.2(a),
and any Third-Party Claim to the extent arising out of or resulting from this
Section 9.2(a), the "Company Representation Indemnities");

(e) any breach of, or default in connection with, any of the covenants of or
agreements made by the Company in this Agreement and any failure of any

7.2(j) to be true and correct as of the date such certificate shall be
delivered to Parent;

(including any holder of options) of any Acquired Company (whether against any
Acquired Company, Parent, any Affiliate of the Company or Parent, or any
officer, director, employee or authorized representative of any of the
foregoing) (i) relating to this Agreement (including any payments made
pursuant to Section 2.12) or the Merger, (ii) alleging any ownership of or
interest in any shares or other securities of any Acquired Company that is not
specifically disclosed in the Spreadsheet or (iii) that is in any way
inconsistent with, or that involves an allegation of facts inconsistent with,
any of the information set forth in Section 3.4, in Schedule 3.4 of the
Company Disclosure Letter or in the Spreadsheet;

(h) the exercise by any Company Stockholder of appraisal rights under Section

9.3 Limitations.

(a) In the case of a claim with respect to any of the Company Representation
Indemnities, each Indemnifying Party shall be severally and not jointly liable
for such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of any Damages resulting
therefrom up to an amount equal to the Escrow Amount and recovery from the
Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for
any such claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement, except in
the case of (i) the indemnification provided under Section 9.2(i), or (ii) any
failure of any of the Specified Representations to be true and correct as set
forth in Section 9.2(a).

(b) In the case of (i) any failure of any of the Specified Representations to
be true and correct as set forth in Section 9.2(a), (ii) any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement made pursuant to clauses (b)
through (f), (i) and (j) of Section 9.2 and (iii) any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement made pursuant to clause (h) of
Section 9.2 arising out of an alleged breach of any Specified Representation
or the matters described in clauses (b) through (f), (i) and (j) of Section
9.2, each Indemnifying Party shall be severally and not jointly liable for
such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of any Damages resulting therefrom up
to an amount equal to (i) the aggregate amount of cash paid to such
Indemnifying Party pursuant to Article 2 (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any cash retained by Parent pursuant to the terms of any Management
Holder's Support Agreement), inclusive of contributions to the Escrow Fund,
plus (ii) (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock (if any)
paid to such Indemnifying Party pursuant to Article 2 (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any shares of Parent Common Stock retained by Parent
pursuant to the terms of any Management Holder's Support Agreement), inclusive
of contributions to the Escrow Fund, multiplied by (B) the Average Trading
Price). In the case of (1) any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement made pursuant to clause (g) of Section 9.2 and (2) any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement made pursuant to clause (h) of
Section 9.2 arising out of an alleged breach of the matters described in
clause (g) of Section 9.2, each Indemnifying Party shall be severally and not
jointly liable for such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of any Damages
resulting therefrom up to an amount equal to the amount set forth on Schedule
9.2(g).

(c) Except pursuant to the indemnification provided under Section 9.2(i), no
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to any Indemnified Party for any fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or knowing and willful breach by any other
Person. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, there shall be no
maximum liability for any Indemnifying Party who committed or was complicit in
committing fraud or made any intentional misrepresentation in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or knowingly
and willfully breached this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except for any
claims of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or knowing and willful breach
that are asserted against the Person who allegedly committed such fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or knowing and willful breach, the Indemnified
Party shall be required to first seek recourse to the Escrow Fund for all
indemnifiable Damages prior to seeking further indemnification recourse
directly against the Indemnifying Parties. For Damages that are outside of the
Escrow Fund (i) from the Closing Date until the date that is 6 months after
the Closing Date, each Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its
election, to settle any such Damages for which the Indemnifying Party is
responsible in cash or shares of Parent Common Stock received in connection
with the Merger (which shares shall be valued at the Average Trading Price),
and (ii) following the date that is 6 months after the Closing Date, each
Indemnifying Party shall be required to settle any such Damages for which the
Indemnifying Party is responsible in cash.

(e) No Indemnified Party may receive any portion of the Escrow Fund in respect
of any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement that is made
pursuant to the Company Representation Indemnities (in each case except for
any claims (i) with respect to any Specified Representations or (ii) which
involve fraud, knowing and willful breach or intentional misrepresentation),
unless and until Damages in the aggregate under all claims that have been
incurred or paid exceed $750,000 (the "Basket"), in which case the Indemnified
Parties may make claims for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement for
all Damages, including the amount of the Basket. In determining the amount of
any Damages in respect of the failure of any representation or warranty to be
true and correct as of any particular date, but not in determining whether a
breach of a representation or warranty has occurred, any materiality, Material
Adverse Effect or similar qualification limiting the scope of such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of
calculating or determining the amount of Damages incurred under Section 9.2,
there shall be deducted from any Damages an amount equal to the amount of any
proceeds actually received by any Indemnified Party from any third-party
insurer or third party contractual indemnification or contribution provisions
in connection with such Damages (after giving effect to any deductible or
retention or increase in premium associated therewith to the extent paid or
payable and net of any costs, Taxes and expenses of recovery or collection
thereof); provided, however, that none of the Indemnified Parties shall have
any obligation to (i) seek recovery against any insurance policies or to
enforce such third party contractual indemnification or contribution
provisions, or (ii) obtain insurance coverage or other third party protection
with respect to any particular matter; provided, further, that in the event
the Indemnified Parties first recover against the Escrow Fund or the
Indemnifying Parties directly for any particular Damages and thereafter
recover for the same Damages pursuant to any existing insurance policies
and/or contractual indemnification or contribution provisions, then the amount
recovered pursuant to such existing insurance policies and/or contractual
indemnification or contribution provisions (up to the amount first recovered
by the Indemnified Parties) shall promptly be paid to the Indemnifying Parties
by Parent.

(g) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to double recovery for any
adjustments to the Merger Consideration provided for hereunder or for any
indemnifiable Damages even though such Damages may have resulted from the
breach of more than one of the representations, warranties, agreements and
covenants in this Agreement. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement in respect of any Damages to the extent
such Damages were taken into account in the calculation of, and reduced the
value of (i) the Final Adjusted Transaction Value, including the calculation
of the Closing Debt Amount, the amount of Transaction Fees (including the
Closing Employee Payments) and (ii) the Closing Working Capital Amount.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances will any party be liable to the other for any punitive,
speculative or remote damages or any damages that are not the reasonably
foreseeable consequence of any breach or inaccuracy contained in this
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, or any certificate, document or
agreement contemplated by or required to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement (except, in the case of punitive damages, to the extent such
punitive damages are awarded to a third party pursuant to a Third-Party
Claim).

(i) The rights to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement set forth in
this Agreement based on the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
and obligations set forth herein shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted by Parent, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
at any time (whether before or after the Agreement Date or the Closing Date),
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation.

(j) The parties acknowledge the applicability of the common law duty to
mitigate Damages.

9.4 Notice of Claim.

(c) As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement of an Indemnified Party for Damages under this
Article 9.

(d) Parent, on behalf of itself or an Indemnified Party, shall give written
notice of a Claim that complies with the requirements of Section 9.6 and is
executed by Parent (a "Notice of Claim") to the Representative reasonably
promptly after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of the existence of any
potential claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this
Article 9, arising from or relating to:

(i) any matter specified in Section 9.2; or

(ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against any Indemnified
Party of an Action brought by a third party against such Indemnified Party
that is based on, arises out of, or relates to subject matter that, if
determined adversely to such Indemnified Party (regardless of the eventual
outcome of such Action), could result in a Claim (in each such case, a "Third-
Party Claim").

(e) No delay on the part of an Indemnified Party in giving the Representative
a Notice of Claim (or any update or amendment thereto after conducting
discovery regarding the underlying facts and circumstances set forth therein)
shall relieve the Representative or any Indemnifying Party from any of their
respective obligations under this Article 9 unless (and then only to the
extent that) the Representative or the Indemnifying Parties are materially
prejudiced thereby in terms of the amount of Damages for which the
Indemnifying Parties are obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.

9.5 Defense of Third-Party Claims.

(n) Parent or its Subsidiaries shall determine and conduct the investigation,
defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim, and the costs and expenses
incurred or paid by the Indemnified Party in connection with such
investigation, defense or settlement (including reasonable, out-of-pocket
attorneys' fees, other professionals' and experts' fees, costs of
investigation and court or arbitration costs) shall be included in the Damages
for which the Indemnified Party may seek indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to a Claim made by any Indemnified Party hereunder,
regardless of the resolution of such Third-Party Claim and whether it is
ultimately determined that such Third-Party Claim arose out of, resulted from
or was in connection with a matter for which indemnity is otherwise provided
pursuant to Section 9.2; provided, that the foregoing shall be subject to
Section 9.2 and Section 9.3.

(o) The Representative shall have the right to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the Third-Party Claim to
the extent that receipt of such documents by the Representative does not
affect any privilege relating to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified
Party shall provide the Representative the opportunity to consult with and
participate in, but, except as set forth in Section 10.3, not to determine or
conduct, any defense of the Third-Party Claim or settlement negotiations with
respect to the Third-Party Claim, all at the sole expense of the
Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties).

(p) Notwithstanding Section 9.2(h) or anything else to the contrary contained
herein, no settlement of any such Third-Party Claim with any third party
claimant shall be determinative of the existence or amount of Damages relating
to such matter, except with the consent of the Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be
deemed to have been given unless the Representative shall have objected within
30 days after written request for such consent by the Indemnified Party;
provided that, for the sake of clarity, it is understood and agreed that the
Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders) will have the
right to contest or dispute any such settlement entered into without the
consent of the Representative on the basis that it was not reasonably entered
into.

9.6 Contents of Notice of Claim. Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnified Party
given pursuant to Section 9.4 shall contain the following information: (a)
that such Indemnified Party has directly or indirectly incurred or paid or, in
good faith, believes it shall have to directly or indirectly incur or pay,
Damages in an aggregate stated amount arising from such Claim (which amount
may be a good faith estimated amount or may be the amount of Damages claimed
by a third party in a Third-Party Claim); and (b) a brief description, in
reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably available to such Indemnified
Party), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged
Damages based on such Indemnified Party's good faith belief thereof,
including, to the extent reasonably available to such Indemnified Party: (i)
the identity and address of any third-party claimant, (ii) copies of any
formal demand or complaint and (iii) the specific nature of the breach to
which such item is related; provided, however, that the Notice of Claim may be
updated and amended from time to time by the Indemnified Party in good faith
by delivering an updated or amended Notice of Claim to the Representative, so
long as the delivery of the original Notice of Claim is made within the
applicable claims period and such update or amendment only asserts bases for
liability arising out of or resulting from the same facts and circumstances
specifically set forth in such original Notice of Claim; provided, further,
that all Claims for Damages properly set forth in the original Notice of Claim
or any permitted update or amendment thereto shall remain outstanding until
such Claims for Damages have been finally resolved or satisfied,
notwithstanding the expiration of such claims period.

9.7 Resolution of Notice of Claim.

(e) Each Notice of Claim given by an Indemnified Party shall be resolved as
follows:

(i) Uncontested Claims. If, within 45 days after a Notice of Claim is received
by the Representative, the Representative does not contest such Notice of
Claim in writing to the Indemnified Party as provided in Section 9.7(a)(ii),
the Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have consented, on behalf
of all Indemnifying Parties, to the recovery by the Indemnified Party of the
full amount of Damages (subject to the limitations contained in this Article
9) specified in the Notice of Claim in accordance with this Article 9,
including the forfeiture of all or a portion of the Escrow Fund, and, without
further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final judgment for
damages against the Indemnifying Parties for such amount in any court having
jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper.

(ii) Contested Claims. If the Representative gives the Indemnified Party
written notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a
"Contested Claim") within the 45-day period specified in Section 9.7(a)(i),
then such Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (A) a written settlement
agreement executed by Parent and the Representative (a copy of which shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent if the Claim involves recovery against the
Escrow Fund) or (B) in the absence of such a written settlement agreement
within 45 days following receipt by the Indemnified Party of the written
notice from the Representative, by binding litigation between Parent and the
Representative in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 9.7(b).

(f) Litigation of Contested Claims. Either Parent or the Representative may
bring suit in the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of
the United States of America located within the State of Delaware to resolve a
Contested Claim. Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction.

(g) Payment of Claims. If any amount is determined, agreed or deemed agreed to
be owed to any Indemnified Person in accordance with this Section 9.7, then
(i) within three Business Days following the date such amount is determined,
agreed or deemed agreed to be owed, Parent and the Representative shall
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to release such amount to the Indemnified Party from the
Escrow Fund (to the extent of the Escrow Fund), it being understood that for
purposes of this Section 9.7(c), any share of Parent Common Stock that is
released to the Indemnified Party in satisfaction of an Indemnifying Party's
obligations hereunder shall be valued at the Average Trading Price, and (ii)
if the amount remaining in the Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the full
amount that is determined, agreed or deemed agreed to be owed to such
Indemnified Party, then, subject to the limitations contained in Section 9.3,
the Indemnified Party shall send notice to the Representative within 10 days
following the date such amount is determined, agreed or deemed agreed to be
owed, and each Indemnifying Party shall thereafter promptly pay such
Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of the amount of such shortfall to such
Indemnified Party.

9.8 Release of Remaining Escrow Fund. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Escrow Release Date (but not more than three Business Days
therefrom), Parent and the Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent,
subject to Section 9.9, to deliver to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to each Indemnifying Party, with respect to each share of Company
Capital Stock held by such Person, an amount equal to (i) the Specified
Fraction with respect to such share of Company Capital Stock, multiplied by
(ii) all of funds in the Escrow Fund (if any) in excess of any amounts in the
Escrow Fund that are reasonably necessary (such amount, the "Held Back
Amount") to satisfy all unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims for Damages
specified in any Notice of Claim delivered to the Representative before the
Escrow Release Date, which amount shall be apportioned in accordance with
Section 2.3. If any Claim is unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed as of the
Escrow Release Date, then the Escrow Agent shall retain possession and custody
of that portion of the Escrow Fund that equals the Held Back Amount to
continue to serve as security for Damages then being claimed by the
Indemnified Parties in all such unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims,
and as soon as all such Claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall,
subject to Section 9.9, deliver to each Indemnifying Party, with respect to
each share of Company Capital Stock held by such Person, an amount equal to
(A) the Specified Fraction with respect to such share of Company Capital
Stock, multiplied by (B) all remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund (if any)
that are not required to satisfy such Claims, which amount shall be
apportioned in accordance with Section 2.3.

9.9 Payment Conditions. With respect to any amount to be released from the
Escrow Fund or the Expense Fund Amount pursuant to Sections 9.8 or 9.13(c),
any amounts to be paid to the Company Stockholders and the Indemnifying
Optionholders pursuant to Sections 2.4(f) and Section 2.12(b):

(h) if any Indemnifying Party who held shares of Company Capital Stock has not
executed and delivered a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and
surrendered such Person's Certificate(s) or affidavits of loss relating
thereto, in each case, in accordance with Section 2.8 (the "Payment
Conditions") prior to the date on which any amount is to be distributed from
the Escrow Fund or the Expense Fund Amount or to be paid to such Indemnifying
Party, then any amount that would otherwise be released or paid to such
Indemnifying Party shall be held by the Exchange Agent, without interest,
until such Indemnifying Party satisfies all applicable Payment Conditions; and

(i) unless the Representative provides updated payment delivery instructions,
each distribution to be made from the Escrow Fund or the Expense Fund Amount,
and each payment to be made by Parent pursuant to Section 2.4(f) or Section
2.12(b), to a particular Indemnifying Party shall be effected in accordance
with the payment delivery instructions set forth in such Person's Letter of
Transmittal.

9.10 Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments. All payments (if any) made
to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement obligations under this Article 9 will be treated as adjustments
to the purchase price for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern
for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by Law.

9.11 No Right of Contribution. No Indemnifying Party or the Representative
acting on their behalf shall make any claim for indemnification, compensation,
reimbursement or contribution from Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate, assign or successor of any of the foregoing with
respect to any indemnification, compensation or reimbursement claims arising
under or in connection with this Agreement to the extent that the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any Indemnified Party is determined to be entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder for such claim, it
being acknowledged and agreed that the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of the Company are solely for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties.

9.12 Exclusive Remedy. Following the Closing, except for (i) claims in
connection with fraud, intentional misrepresentation or knowing and willful
breach, other than pursuant to Section 9.2(i) (provided that any claims for
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or knowing and willful breach, other than
pursuant to Section 9.2(i), may be asserted solely against the Person who
allegedly committed such fraud, intentional misrepresentation or knowing and
willful breach), (ii) the right to specific performance or injunctive relief
as contemplated by Section 11.5, or (iii) the right to pursue remedies under
any agreement entered into by a Person in connection with this Agreement, the
rights to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement provided by Section
9.2 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any Damages of any Indemnified
Party with respect to any breach of this Agreement by the Company or with
respect to any of the matters set forth in Section 9.2.

9.13 Appointment of Representative.

(a) By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, executing and
delivering a Support Agreement or participating in the Merger and receiving
the benefits thereof, each Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have approved
the designation of and hereby designates the Representative as the
representative of the Indemnifying Parties and as the attorney-in-fact and
agent for and on behalf of each Indemnifying Party with respect to Claims
under this Article 9 and the taking by the Representative of any and all
actions within the scope of this Section 9.13 and the making of any decisions
required or permitted to be taken by the Representative under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement, including the
exercise of the power to: (i) give and receive notices and communications to
or from (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Party) and/or the Escrow
Agent relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, any Company Ancillary
Agreement, or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or
thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
Company Ancillary Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or
communication shall be given or received by such Indemnifying Party
individually), (ii) authorize the release or delivery to Parent of all or a
portion of the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of Claims by or any other
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 9 (including by not objecting to
such Claims), (iii) agree to, object to, negotiate, resolve, enter into
settlements and compromises of, demand litigation of, and comply with orders
of courts with respect to (A) Claims by an Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Article 9 or (B) any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such
Indemnifying Party, in each case, relating to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement and (iv) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment
of the Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The
Representative shall have authority and power to act on behalf of each
Indemnifying Party with respect to the disposition, settlement or other
handling of all Claims under this Article 9 and all rights or obligations
arising under this Article 9. The Indemnifying Parties shall be bound by all
actions taken and documents executed by the Representative in connection with
this Agreement, and Parent and the other Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to rely on any action or decision of the Representative. The Indemnifying
Parties recognize and intend that the power of attorney granted in this
Section 9.13(a) and the powers, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Representative hereunder: (1) are coupled with an interest and
are irrevocable; (2) may be delegated by the Representative; and (3) shall
survive the death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy or winding
up of each of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be binding on any successor
thereto. Each Indemnifying Party (aa) agrees that all actions taken by the
Representative within the scope of this Section 9.13(a) or under the Escrow
Agreement shall be binding upon such Indemnifying Party and such Indemnifying
Party's successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such
Indemnifying Party and (bb) waives any and all defenses which may be available
to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Representative taken in good
faith under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Representative shall
only have the duties expressly stated in this Agreement and shall have no
other duty, express or implied. The Representative may engage attorneys,
accountants and other professionals and experts. The Representative may in
good faith rely conclusively upon information, reports, statements and
opinions prepared or presented by such professionals, and any action taken by
the Representative based on such reliance shall be deemed conclusively to have
been taken in good faith. Parent may conclusively rely, without independent
verification or investigation, upon any action of the Representative as being
the binding decision or action of the Indemnifying Parties, and Parent shall
not be liable to any Indemnifying Party or any other Person for any actions
taken or omitted from being taken by them or by Parent in accordance with or
reliance upon any decision or action of the Representative. The Person serving
as the Representative may be replaced from time to time by the holders of a
majority in interest of the Escrow Fund then on deposit with the Escrow Agent
upon not less than 10 Business Days' prior written notice to Parent and the
Escrow Agent. The Person serving as the Representative may resign at any time,
in which case the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund then on
deposit with the Escrow Agent shall, within 10 days after such resignation,
appoint a successor Representative who shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Parent. Neither the removal of the then acting Representative nor the
appointment of a successor Representative shall be effective until the
delivery to Parent of an acknowledgement signed by the successor
Representative that he, she or it accepts the responsibility of successor the
Representative and agrees to perform and be bound by all of the provisions of
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other agreement entered into or
document delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement applicable to the Representative. After the Closing, notices or
communications to or from the Representative shall constitute notice to or
from each of the Indemnifying Parties.

(b) Each Indemnifying Party hereby authorizes Parent to withhold the Expense
Fund Amount from the amounts otherwise payable by Parent to the Indemnifying
Parties pursuant to Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(e) and Section 2.1(g), with
Parent to withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to each
Indemnifying Party and deliver to the Representative an amount equal to each
Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share of the Expense Fund Amount. In no event
shall the Representative be liable to any Indemnifying Party in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Representative. The
Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expenses of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively,
"Representative Expenses") arising out of or in connection with the
Representative's execution and performance of this Agreements and the
agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Expense is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Representative
Expense is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Representative, the Representative
will reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified
Representative Expenses to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Representative by the
Indemnifying Parties, such Representative Expenses must be recovered by the
Representative first from the Expense Fund Amount and, once the Expense Fund
Amount is exhausted, then the Representative may seek recourse for
Representative Expenses from (i) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time
as such amount remaining therein would otherwise be distributable to the
Indemnifying Parties, and (ii) from any Variable Payout Amount at such time as
any such amount would otherwise be distributable to the Indemnifying Parties;
provided, that while this Section 9.13(b) allows the Representative to be paid
from the Expense Fund Amount, the Escrow Fund and the Variable Payout Amount
(if any), this does not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Expenses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Representative from seeking any remedies available to
it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or otherwise. For
the avoidance of doubt, any restrictions or limitations on indemnification
contained elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the
indemnities provided to the Representative in this Section 9.13(b). The
foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation removal of the
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

(c) Upon the payment of the Expense Fund Amount by Parent or its designee to
the segregated client bank account maintained by the Representative for the
Expense Fund Amount pursuant to Section 2.5(c), each Indemnifying Party shall
be deemed to have contributed his, her or its Pro Rata Share of the Expense
Fund Amount. The Representative shall hold the Expense Fund Amount in
accordance with this Agreement on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties as a fund
which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. The Indemnifying Parties will not receive any interest
or earnings on the Expense Fund Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to
the Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Representative will not be liable for any loss
of principal of the Expense Fund Amount other than as a result of its gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Representative will hold
these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for
its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of the
Representative's responsibilities, the Representative will deliver the balance
of the Expense Fund Amount to the Exchange Agent for further distribution
(subject to Section 9.9) to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares. For Tax purposes, the Expense Fund Amount will be
treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Indemnifying
Parties at the time of Closing.

ARTICLE 10 
TAX MATTERS

10.1 Tax Returns.

(n) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Acquired Companies that
are required to be filed (taking into account any extension) on or before the
Closing Date, and the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the
Acquired Companies due on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall
be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the past practices of the Company with respect to such items, except as
required by Law. At least 15 Business Days prior to filing any such Tax Return
that is an income Tax Return, the Company shall submit a copy of such Tax
Return to Parent for Parent's review and comment, and the Company shall
consider such comments submitted in writing to the Company within 10 days
after the Company has provided a copy of such Tax Return to Parent in good
faith. To the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall provide Parent
with the supporting works papers relating to such Tax Return.

(o) Subject to Section 10.5 and Section 10.7, following the Closing Date,
Parent shall file all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Acquired
Companies after the Closing Date with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods. At
least 15 Business Days prior to filing any such income Tax Return, and as soon
as practical with respect to any other Tax Return, Parent shall submit a copy
of such Tax Return to the Representative for the Representative's review and
comment, and Parent shall consider such comments submitted in writing to
Parent within 10 days after Parent has provided a copy of such Tax Return to
the Representative in good faith. To the extent requested by the
Representative, Parent shall provide the Representative with the supporting
works papers relating to such Tax Return. In addition, to the extent any such
Tax Return is not prepared consistent with the past practices of the Company,
except as required by Law, Parent shall make changes to such Tax Return
reasonably requested by the Representative. If any dispute with respect to a
Tax Return described in this Section 10.1(b) is not resolved prior to the due
date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which
the Parent deems correct, without prejudice to the rights and obligations of
the parties and the Company Securityholders under this Agreement.

(p) From and after 10 days prior to the due date of the payment of Taxes on
any Tax Returns which Parent has the responsibility to cause to be filed
pursuant to Section 10.1(b), without duplication of, or prejudice to, the
Indemnified Parties' rights to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement
under Section 9.2, Parent shall be entitled to make a claim for withdrawal
from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Article 9 for an amount equal to the
amount of Indemnified Taxes actually shown on such Tax Returns.

10.2 Cooperation. Parent and the Representative agree to furnish or cause to
be furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to Taxes, including access to books and
records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by
Parent, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any
audit by any Tax authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit
or proceeding relating to any Tax. Each of Parent, the Company and the
Representative shall retain all books and records in their possession with
respect to Taxes for a period of at least seven years following the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision herein to the
contrary, including Section 9.5(b), in no event shall the Representative be
entitled to review or otherwise have access to any income Tax Return, or
information related thereto, of Parent or its Affiliates (other than income
Tax Returns of the Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods).

10.3 Tax Audits.

(f) If notice of any Action with respect to Taxes of the Acquired Companies (a
"Tax Claim") shall be received by any party for which any other party may
reasonably be expected to be liable, the notified party shall notify such
other party or parties in writing of such Tax Claim; provided, however, that
the failure of the notified party to give any other party notice as provided
herein shall not relieve such other party of its indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement obligations under Article 9 or this Article 10 except to the
extent that such other party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.
Tax Claims shall be considered Third-Party Claims for purposes of Article 9.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, to the extent that a
provision of this Section 10.3 directly conflicts with any provision of
Article 9, this Section 10.3 shall govern.

(g) Parent shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Claim of any
Acquired Company. To the extent a Tax Claim relates to Taxes attributable to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, Parent shall (i) keep the Representative informed of
all developments on a timely basis, (ii) provide to the Representative copies
of any and all material correspondence from any Governmental Authority related
to such Tax Claim, (iii) provide the Representative with the opportunity to
attend conferences with the relevant Governmental Authority (if reasonably
practical) and to review and provide comments with respect to written
responses provided to the relevant Governmental Authority and (iv) not settle,
compromise or abandon any such Tax Claim which relates to or may reasonably
give rise to any Indemnified Taxes without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

10.4 Transfer Taxes. Any transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, VAT and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real
estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby ("Transfer Taxes") will be borne by the
Company Stockholders. The Representative and the Company Stockholders agree to
file or cause to be filed in a timely manner all necessary documents
(including all Tax Returns) with respect to all such amounts for which the
Company Stockholders are so liable. The Representative shall provide Parent
with evidence satisfactory to Parent that such Transfer Taxes have been paid
by the Company Stockholders.

10.1 Transaction Expenses. Any deductions attributable to the payment of
Transaction Fees or in connection with the retirement of Debt of the Acquired
Companies as contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation
deductions from the cancellation of Company Options, shall to the maximum
extent allowed by Law and for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, be treated as
accrued on the Closing Date and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall elect on each of the Surviving Corporation's Tax Returns for the year
including the Closing Date under IRS Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to deduct
seventy percent (70%) of any eligible Transaction Fees that are success-based
fees within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.263(a)-5(f).

10.2 Tax Refunds. Any Tax refund (including any Specified Tax Refund) that is
received by Parent or any Acquired Company after the Closing Date or that is
credited against any Tax to which Parent or any Acquired Company becomes
entitled, in each case that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be for
the account of the Company Stockholders and Indemnifying Optionholders (in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares), and Parent shall pay over
to the Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Company Stockholders and
Indemnifying Optionholders (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares) any such refund, without interest, net of reasonable third-party
costs, expenses and Taxes incurred by Parent or any Acquired Company in
connection with obtaining or in connection with the receipt or accrual of such
refund within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto; provided, however,
that Parent shall not be required to pay over to the Exchange Agent Tax
refunds or amounts credited against Taxes if such Tax refunds or amounts
credited against Taxes are (a) included in the calculation of, and increased
the value of, the Closing Working Capital Amount pursuant to Section 2.4, or
have previously been taken into account in the determination of Indemnified
Taxes or (b) attributable to a carry-back of net operating losses or other Tax
attributes from any taxable period (or portion of any Straddle Period)
beginning after the Closing Date. Parent and the Acquired Companies shall
cooperate in good faith with the Representative to diligently apply for the
Specified Tax Refunds with the appropriate Governmental Authorities, including
through filing necessary amended Tax Returns in accordance with applicable
Law.

10.3 Close of Tax Year. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of the Acquired
Companies (including the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time) shall
take any action, or permit any action to be taken, that may prevent the tax
year of the Company from ending, for U.S. federal and applicable state, local
and foreign income Tax purposes, at the end of the day on the Closing Date.

10.4 Post-Closing Tax Action. Unless required by applicable Law, Parent and
the Acquired Companies shall not amend any Tax Return of any of the Acquired
Companies with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, initiate discussions or
examinations with Governmental Authorities regarding Taxes with respect to
Pre-Closing Tax Periods, make any voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, waive the carryback of any net operating losses
generated in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, change any accounting method or adopt
any convention that shifts taxable income from a Tax period beginning (or
deemed to begin) after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or shifts
deductions or losses from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to a Tax period beginning
(or deemed to begin) after the Closing Date, or otherwise take any actions
outside the Ordinary Course of Business with respect to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Representative, to the extent any such action, initiation of discussions or
examinations, voluntary disclosure, change in accounting method or adoption of
any convention would give rise to an indemnification obligation under Article
9.

ARTICLE 11 
MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, irrespective of
its conflicts of law principles. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (unless the Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the
matter, in which case the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware) solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and of any of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including resolution of disputes under Section 9.7(b)), and hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject
thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect
to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware; provided that a judgment rendered by such court may be
enforced in any court having competent jurisdiction. The parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in Section 11.8 or in such other manner as may be
permitted by Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. With respect
to any particular action, suit or proceeding, venue shall lie solely in the
State of Delaware.

11.2 Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Parent, including any
successor to, or assignee of, all or substantially all of the business and
assets of Parent. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no party
hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of this
provision shall be void.

11.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable,
then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to
other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.

11.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including via facsimile, .pdf or other electronic means), each
of which shall be an original as regards any party whose signature appears
thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more counterparts
hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures of all
parties reflected hereon as signatories.

11.5 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
Law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy
for any such damage. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity,
and the parties hereby agree to (i) not raise any objection to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance and (ii) waive
any requirements for posting a bond in connection with any such action.

11.6 Amendments and Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), only by a writing signed by Parent, the Company and the
Representative. The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the
performance hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other
default or any succeeding breach or default. This Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto as provided in this Section 11.6 at any time before or
after adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, but, after such
adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires the further
approval of the Company Stockholders without obtaining such further approval.
At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent may,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in any of the representations and warranties made to it
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for its benefit contained
herein. No such waiver or extension shall be effective unless signed in
writing by the party against whom such waiver or extension is asserted. The
failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions hereof shall not be
construed to be a waiver of the right of such party thereafter to enforce such
provisions.

11.7 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whether or not
the Merger is successfully consummated, each party shall bear its respective
legal, accountants, and financial advisory fees and other expenses incurred
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, it being the intention of the parties that if the Merger is
consummated, the Transaction Fees be taken into account in calculating the
Adjusted Transaction Value as set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of any filing fee required under
the HSR Act.

11.8 Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either hand delivered in
person, sent by facsimile, sent by electronic mail, sent by certified or
registered first-class mail, postage pre-paid, or sent by nationally
recognized express courier service. Such notices and other communications
shall be effective upon receipt if hand delivered or sent during normal
business hours by facsimile (effective as of the delivery of the facsimile
confirmation) or electronic mail, three Business Days after mailing if sent by
mail, and one Business Day after dispatch if sent by express courier or after
receipt if not sent during normal business hours by facsimile or electronic

11.9 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any
controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party hereto certifies and acknowledges that (a) no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented to it,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each such party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) each such
party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each such party has been induced
to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the waivers and
certifications in this Section 11.9.

11.10 Interpretation; Rules of Construction; Miscellaneous.

(a) The terms "hereof," "herein" and similar terms refer to this Agreement as
a whole (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto), and when a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits,
Schedules, Sections or Articles, such reference shall be to an Exhibit or
Schedule to, Section or Article of this Agreement, respectively, unless
otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "asset" or "property" shall be construed as having the
same meaning and effect and to refer to any and all assets and properties,
real and personal, tangible and intangible. When a reference is made to a
specific Law, act or statute, such reference shall include any regulations
promulgated thereunder. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument, or statute, in each case,
as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented (in the case of
agreements or instruments, if permitted under this Agreement), including (in
the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case
of statutes) by succession or comparable successor statutes. The headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The terms
defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement and
include plural as well as the singular. Accounting terms not otherwise defined
have the meaning assigned to them in accordance with GAAP. Pronouns of either
gender or neuter shall include, as appropriate, the other pronoun forms.
Unless stated otherwise, the terms "dollars" and "$" shall mean United States
dollars. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by legal
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. When
calculating the period of time before which, within which or following which
any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that
is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the
last day of such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall
end on the next succeeding Business Day. Any dollar amounts or thresholds set
forth herein shall not be used as a determinative benchmark for establishing
what is or is not "material" or a "Material Adverse Effect" or a "Material
Adverse Change" or a "Parent Material Adverse Effect" (or words of similar
import) under this Agreement.

(b) Article 7 shall be subject to the agreement set forth in Schedule
11.10(b).

(c) When used in this Agreement, (i) "knowing and willful breach" shall mean a
knowing and willful breach of a covenant, and (ii) "fraud" shall mean common
law fraud.

11.11 Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. None of the provisions of this Agreement
are intended, nor shall be interpreted, to provide or create any third party
beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind in any client, customer,
employee, Affiliate, stockholder, partner or any party hereto or any other
Person unless specifically provided otherwise herein and, except as so
provided (but without prejudice to the indemnity obligations of the
Indemnifying Parties contained in this Agreement), all provisions hereof shall
be personal solely between the parties to this Agreement; provided, however,
that (a) Section 6.4 is intended to benefit the Company Indemnified Parties
and (b) Article 9 is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties.

11.12 Public Announcement. Parent may issue such press releases, and make such
other disclosures regarding the Merger, as it determines are required under
applicable securities Laws or regulatory or stock exchange rules or as it
deems otherwise appropriate. The Company shall not make any public
announcement relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without Parent's prior written consent.

11.13 Confidentiality.

(a) The Company and Parent hereby amend the Confidentiality Agreement by
adding a new Section 9 thereto, which section shall read as follows:

"9. This Agreement shall expire on the earlier of (a) the closing of the
merger contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger among Vonage
Holdings Corp., Neptune Acquisition Corp., Nexmo Inc., and Shareholder
Representative Services LLC, as the Representative, dated as of May 5, 2016
(the "Merger Agreement") and (b) one year from the date of the Merger
Agreement, provided that the confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations of
the Receiving Party shall survive the expiration of this Agreement, and
provided, further, that such expiration shall not relieve any party from
liability for breach of this Agreement occurring before such expiration."

(b) From and after the Closing, the restrictions on the use and disclosure of
Proprietary Information (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply to
Parent or its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (as such term is
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any information
relating to the Company Business.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement, after the
Closing: (i) all Proprietary Information included in the Company Intellectual
Property Rights or embodied in the Company Technology and Company Intellectual
Property Rights that are not owned by a third Person shall be the confidential
information of Parent (and not of the Acquired Companies or any of their
Affiliates) for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement, regardless of
whether such Proprietary Information or Technology were identified or
otherwise designated as "confidential," and (ii) Parent shall be considered
the "Disclosing Party" under the Confidentiality Agreement and the Acquired
Companies and any of their Affiliates who have had access to Proprietary
Information included in the Company Intellectual Property Rights or embodied
in the Company Technology or Company Intellectual Property Rights that are not
owned by a third Person shall be considered the "Receiving Party" under the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Acquired Companies and any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors, representatives and
Affiliates who have had or will have access to such Proprietary Information or
Technology shall be bound by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement until
the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, and, for the avoidance of doubt,
Parent shall have no obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement with
respect to such Proprietary Information or Technology.

(d) The parties thereto agree to continue to abide by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, as amended pursuant to this Section 11.13. The
Representative agrees to hold this Agreement and each document contemplated
hereby in confidence and not disclose the terms hereof or thereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to any third party (other than as
required by law, to its advisors and representatives, or to the Indemnifying
Parties).

11.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the
Company Ancillary Agreements, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Ancillary Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Merger Sub
Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings, inducements or
conditions, express or implied, written or oral, between the parties with
respect hereto or thereto. The express terms hereof control and supersede any
course of performance or usage of the trade inconsistent with any of the terms
hereof.

11.15 No Additional Representations. Parent acknowledges that (a) none of the
Acquired Companies nor any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, expressed or implied, as to the Acquired Companies, the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Acquired Companies furnished or
made available to Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives, or any other
matter related to the transactions contemplated herein, except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement, (b) Parent and Merger Sub have not relied on any
representation or warranty from the Acquired Companies or any other Person in
determining to enter into this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement, (c) none of the Acquired Companies or any other Person shall
have or be subject to any liability to Parent or any other Person resulting
from the distribution to Parent, or Parent's use of, any information,
documents or material made available to Parent or conveyed in any management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except to the extent such information is set forth in
Article III, and (d) none of the Acquired Companies or any other Person shall
have any liability to Parent or any other Person with respect to any
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenue,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations, future cash flows or
the future financial condition of the Acquired Companies or the future
business, operations or affairs of the Acquired Companies, except to the
extent such information is set forth in Article III; provided, however, that
subject to the terms of Article 9, the foregoing shall not apply to any claim
for fraud, knowing and willful breach or intentional misrepresentation.

11.16 Attorney-Client Privilege.

(j) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that Goodwin Procter
LLP ("Goodwin") has acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(k) Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on behalf of
the Surviving Corporation, that all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among any of Goodwin and the Company, Representative
and/or any of the Indemnifying Parties (collectively, the "Seller Parties"),
or any of their respective directors, officers employees or other
representatives that relate to the negotiation, documentation and consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or, beginning on the
Agreement Date, any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the
"Deal Communications"), shall be deemed to be retained by the Seller Parties,
shall be controlled by the Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties and shall not be claimed by Parent or its Affiliates (including
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation) (collectively, the "Parent
Parties"). All Deal Communications that are attorney-client privileged (the
"Privileged Deal Communications") shall remain privileged after the Closing
and the privilege and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto
shall belong solely to the Representative and the Indemnifying Parties, shall
be controlled by the Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and,
except as provided below, shall not be claimed by Parent Parties.

(l) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
the Parent Parties, on the one hand, and a third party other than the Seller
Parties, on the other hand, Parent may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Communications to such third party or
waive such privilege if desired in connection with resolving such dispute. In
the event that Parent is legally required or requested by governmental order
or otherwise (any such request or order, a "Legal Request") to access or
obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged Communications, Parent
shall be entitled to access or obtain a copy of and disclose the Privileged
Communications to the extent necessary to comply with any such Legal Request.
In the event of any Legal Request, Parent shall promptly notify the
Representative in writing (prior to the disclosure by Parent of any Privileged
Communications to the extent practicable) so that the Representative can seek
a protective order and Parent agrees to use all commercially reasonable
efforts (at the sole cost and expense of the Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties)) to assist therewith.
