proposed adjustments set forth in the Objection Notice within thirty (30)

Representative and the Purchaser agree that Deloitte and Touche, LLP or if
Deloitte and Touche, LLP is not then independent, willing and able, a mutually
acceptable accounting firm of nationally recognized standing (the "
_Independent Auditors_ ") shall, within the 30-day period immediately
following such 30-day period, make the final determination of the Closing Net
Working Capital Calculation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Independent Auditors shall make an independent determination of the Closing
Net Working Capital in compliance with the previous clause that shall be
within the range proposed by the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative in
their respective proposed Closing Net Working Capital Calculations.

finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Settlement Date_ ".

### (f) The Purchaser and the Sellers Representative agree to prepare,
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent (pursuant
to the terms of the Adjustment Escrow Agreement) with respect to the
distribution of the entire Adjustment Escrow Fund promptly following the
Settlement Date. In the event that a payment is to be made to the Purchaser

to deliver the balance of the Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Sellers.

  

### 

  

## **1.6 _Sellers  Representative_**.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Designation and Replacement of Sellers  Representative_.
The Sellers have agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to
act on behalf of the Sellers for certain limited purposes, as specified in
this Section 1.6 (the " _Sellers  Representative_"). The Sellers hereby
designate Citicorp Venture Capital, Ltd. (" _CVC_ ") as the initial Sellers
Representative.  CVC hereby accepts such designation.  The Sellers
Representative may resign at any time effective upon the designation of a
successor Sellers Representative. In the event that a Sellers Representative
resigns, a new Sellers Representative shall be appointed by a vote of
holders who held a majority of the voting stock of the Company immediately
prior to the Closing, such appointment to become effective upon the written
acceptance thereof by the new Sellers Representative, and the Purchaser
shall be given prompt written notice of such new Sellers Representative.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Authority and Rights of Sellers  Representative_. The
Sellers Representative shall have such powers and authority as are necessary
to carry out the functions specified below. The Sellers Representative
shall be responsible, on behalf of any or all of the Sellers, for giving
notices to, and receiving notices from, the Purchaser, and any such notice
received by the Purchaser from the Sellers Representative, or delivered to
the Sellers Representative by the Purchaser, shall be binding upon each
Seller. Each Seller hereby authorizes the Sellers Representative to execute
on behalf of each Seller any amendments to this Agreement on behalf of the
Sellers and, following the Closing, to administer and resolve any claims with
respect to the disposition of the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Adjustment
Escrow Fund. Any notice, communication, direction or document described
herein which is received by the Purchaser and signed by the Sellers
Representative on behalf of the Sellers shall be deemed signed by

## 

  

### (a) No party shall be entitled to assert any claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Sections 6.2(b)_ (other than with respect to a breach of
_Section 3.4_ and _Section 4.18_ ), or _6.3(b)_  unless and until the amount
of the Losses sustained by such party with respect to any individual matter
exceeds $20,000.  In addition, no party shall be obligated to indemnify
another party with respect to any Losses pursuant to _Sections 6.2(b)_ (other
than with respect to a breach of _Section 3.4_ and _Section 4.18_ ), or
_6.3(b)_ as to which a party is otherwise entitled to assert any claim for
indemnification unless and until the aggregate amount of the Losses
attributable to the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Sellers Indemnitees, as the
case may be, exceeds $1,800,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ ");  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that thereafter the Indemnifying Party (as defined below) shall
indemnify the other for any amounts in excess of, and not including, the
Basket Amount.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) the maximum aggregate obligation of the Purchaser pursuant to _Section
6.3(b)_  shall not exceed $18,000,000, exclusive of any amounts due under
_Section 1.5_ , and (ii) the maximum aggregate obligation of the Sellers

amounts due under _Section 1.5_ ; _provided_ that, with respect to any breach
of _Section 3.3_  (Capital Stock) the maximum aggregate obligation of the
Sellers (including all other indemnification obligations of the Sellers
pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_ shall not exceed $180,000,000 exclusive of any
amounts due under _Section 1.5_. For the avoidance of doubt, no Party
shall be entitled to recover for any Losses to the extent such Party
recovered such Losses pursuant to _Section 1.5_.

  

### 

  

### (b) In calculating the amount of Losses suffered or incurred by a party
for which indemnification is sought hereunder there shall be deducted the
amount of (i) any insurance paid to such party or otherwise inuring to the
benefit of such party as a result of any such Loss, and (ii) any reduction in
Taxes attributable to such Losses which directly inures to the permanent
benefit of that party for any current tax year as a result of any such Loss.

  

### 

  

### (c) No Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification
hereunder for any breach of representations and warranties if the Sellers can

Knowledge of the breach and (y) the Purchaser had Knowledge of such breach.

### 25      
   

### 

  

## **6.5 _Indemnification Procedures_**.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Notice of Claim_. Any Person making a claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.2 or 6.3 above (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") must give
the Party (or, in the case of a Seller, the Sellers Representative) from
whom indemnification is sought (as the case may be, an " _Indemnifying Party_
") written notice of such claim (an " _Indemnification Claim Notice_
") promptly after the Indemnified Party receives any written notice of any
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim (a " _Proceeding_
") against or involving the Indemnified Party by a Government Entity or
other third party or otherwise discovers the liability, obligation or facts
giving rise to such claim for indemnification (it being understood that any
claim for indemnity pursuant to Sections 6.2(b) or 6.3(b) above must be made
by notice given within the applicable survival period specified in Section
6.1 above, and upon the issuance of an Indemnification Claim Notice within
such period, any representation or warranty relating to such Indemnification
Claim Notice shall, notwithstanding Section 6.1, continue to survive with
respect to such claim until such claim for indemnification has been satisfied
or otherwise resolved as provided in this Section 6).  Such notice must
contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to
the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss is known at such time).
The failure to promptly give any such notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability hereunder with respect to the subject
matter of such claim except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has
actually been damaged by such failure. In the event that the Purchaser and
the Sellers Representative (with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Fund) or
the Purchaser and the Sellers (following distribution of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund) are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to a claim set forth in
an Indemnification Claim Notice within thirty (30) days following delivery of
the applicable Indemnification Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to seek judicial determination of such claim.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Control of Defense; Conditions_. The obligations of an Indemnifying
Party under this Section 6 with respect to Losses arising from claims of any
third party that are subject to the indemnification provided in Section 6.2
or 6.3 above shall be governed by and contingent upon the following
additional terms and conditions:

  

### 

  

#### (i) At its option an Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume
control of the defense of any claim and may appoint as lead counsel of such
defense any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) If the Indemnifying Party has assumed control of the defense in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.5(b)(i), then the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to settle, compromise or defend such claim at the
Indemnifying Partys sole expense, provided that in conducting such defense,
settlement and compromise: (a) the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to
any lien, encumbrance or other adverse charge upon any asset or business of
the Indemnified Party, (b) the Indemnifying Party shall cause its counsel to
consult with the Indemnified Party and, if applicable, its counsel, and keep
them fully advised of the progress of the defense, settlement and compromise,
(c) such settlement shall involve monetary damages only and shall not in any
way impose any conditions or restrictions on the Indemnified Partys
business, and (d) the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay the full amount
of any Losses resulting from such

  

#### 

  

#### 26      
   

#### 

  

#### claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers Representative shall not
agree to any settlement concerning Taxes for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date which may result in an increase in Taxes for any
taxable period ending after the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of Purchaser.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(b)(i) above, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ
counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such
employment shall be at the Indemnified Partys own expense unless (A) the
employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party
in writing, or (B) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense
and employ counsel in accordance with Section 6.5(b)(i), in which case the
fees and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) So long as the Indemnifying Party is contesting any such claim in
good faith in accordance with the foregoing requirements, the Indemnified
Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnified Party may pay or settle any such claim at any time, provided
that the Indemnified Party waives any right to indemnity therefore by the
Indemnifying Party.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification obligations pursuant
to Section 6 shall be paid within fifteen (15) days after the
determination thereof whether such determination is made by:  (i) joint
agreement between the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative (with respect
to the Indemnity Escrow Fund); (ii) among the Purchaser and any applicable
Sellers; or (iii) by judicial determination. Subject to the limitations of
Section 6.4(a), such Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party
for any and all costs or expenses of any nature or kind whatsoever (including
but not limited to all attorneys fees) incurred in seeking to collect such
Losses. Any payment required under this Section 6 to be made to a Purchaser
Indemnitee (together with interest thereon (if any) and all costs and
expenses related thereto) shall be made first as a deduction from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and paid in accordance with the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement. Subject to the limitations of Section 6.4(a), to the extent
any such payment to be made by the Sellers exceeds the amount of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Sellers or, in the case of any payment under this
Section 6 to a Seller Indemnitee, the Purchaser, shall make such payment(s)
in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Indemnified Party.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Instructions to Escrow Agent_. In the event of a determination that
a payment is due to any Purchaser Indemnitee, the Purchaser and the
Sellers Representative shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to distribute a portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund equal to such
payment.

  

### 

  

## **6.6 _No Contribution_**. In no event shall the Company be required
to provide contribution for any obligation of the Sellers under Section 6.2.
