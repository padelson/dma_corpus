Section 2.5 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes (and, where applicable, state and local income tax purposes), (i)
Parents transfers to Parent LP (or to the Exchange Agent on behalf of Parent
LP) of the Parent Common Shares and the Parent Series A Preferred Shares will
be treated as contributions of the Parent Common Shares and the Parent Series
A Preferred Shares to Parent LP in exchange for a number of Parent LP Common
Units equal to the number of Parent Common Shares transferred to Parent LP and
a number of Parent LP Preferred Units equal to the number of Parent Series A
Preferred Shares transferred to Parent LP, with terms of such Parent LP
Preferred Units to be the same, in all material respects, as the terms of the
Parent Series A Preferred Shares; (ii) the REIT Merger will be treated as a
taxable sale by the Company of all of the Companys assets (including all of
the Companys interests in Company LP, as determined under the applicable U.S.
federal income tax regulations) to Parent LP in exchange for the Aggregate
REIT Merger Consideration and the assumption of all of the Companys
liabilities, immediately followed by a distribution of the Aggregate REIT
Merger Consideration by the Company to the holders of equity interests in the
Company in liquidation of the Company pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562
of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of liquidation"
of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (iii) to the extent
the limited partners of Company LP other than the Company or any other Company
Subsidiary receive New Parent LP Common Units in the Partnership Merger, the
Partnership Merger will be treated as contributions by those limited partners
of their Company LP Common Units to Parent LP in exchange for the New Parent
LP Common Units pursuant to Section 721(a) of the Code. If the Partnership
Merger, either alone or taken together with the REIT Merger, is treated as a
merger of the Company LP with Parent LP for purposes of Section 708(b)(2)(A)
of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c), then such deemed
merger of Company LP with Parent LP shall be treated as an "assets-over" form
of merger under Treasury Regulations 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), with (x) the Company
treated as selling its interests in Company LP to Parent LP in exchange for
the Aggregate REIT Merger Consideration and the assumption of all of the
Companys liabilities (y) any Minority Limited Partner electing to receive
Parent Common Shares treated as selling its interests in Company LP to Parent
LP in exchange for such Parent Common Shares, and (z) Company LP immediately
thereafter contributing all of its assets, subject to all of its liabilities,
to Parent LP, in exchange for interests in Parent LP which are distributed to
the Minority Limited Partners electing to receive New Parent LP Common Units.
The Company, as a party to this Agreement, hereby consents to the
characterization set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, and each
Minority Limited Partner electing to receive Parent Common Shares will consent
to such characterization as a condition to such election being effective. All
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with this Section.

Preferred Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to such Company
Series A Preferred Stock that immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective

shall automatically be converted into validly issued Parent LP Common Units in
Parent LP (" _New Parent LP Common Units_ ") in an amount equal to (x) one
(1), multiplied by (y) the Common Exchange Ratio, and each holder of New
Parent LP Common Units shall be admitted as a limited partner of Parent LP in
accordance with the terms of the Parent Partnership Agreement; _provided_ that
in lieu of receiving New Parent LP Common Units in the Partnership Merger,
each Minority Limited Partner shall have the right to elect to receive for
each Company LP Common Unit held by such Minority Limited Partner a number of
Parent Common Shares equal to (x) one (1), multiplied by (y) the Common
Exchange Ratio, and any Minority Limited Partner so electing shall be deemed
to have elected to redeem its Company LP Common Units pursuant to Section 7.5
of the Company Partnership Agreement, effective immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time and shall be treated as having received in
exchange for its Company LP Common Units an equal number of Company Common
Stock as of such time, without any further action being required by such
Minority Limited Partner. No fractional New Parent LP Common Units or
fractional Parent Common Shares will be issued in the Partnership Merger. Each
Minority Limited Partner shall have the right, if any, to receive, pursuant to
_Section 3.9_, cash in lieu of fractional New Parent LP Common Units or
Parent Common Shares into

 



      
 

 



 

which such Minority Limited Partners Company LP Common Units have been

(a) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock_. As of the Business Day
immediately preceding the REIT Merger Effective Time, each share of Company
Restricted Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the REIT
Merger Effective Time (whether or not then vested) shall automatically become
fully vested, and all restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse. Each
share of Company Common Stock resulting from the vesting of the shares of
Company Restricted Stock in accordance with the preceding sentence (less the
number of shares of Company Common Stock withheld to satisfy the withholding
Tax obligations with respect to such vesting) shall be treated as a share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the REIT
Merger Effective Time and shall be converted into the right to receive the
REIT Common Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)(i)_. As
of the REIT Merger Effective Time, each holder of shares of Company Restricted
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the REIT Common Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement
including the right, if any, to receive, pursuant to _Section 3.9_, cash in

vested or subject to any performance condition that has not been satisfied)
shall automatically become vested to the extent determined as set forth in the
award agreement or other Company Benefit Plan governing such Company RSU, and
all restrictions with respect to such vesting Company RSUs shall lapse. Each
share of Company Common Stock resulting from the vesting of the Company RSUs
in accordance with the preceding sentence (less the number of shares of
Company Common Stock withheld to satisfy the withholding Tax obligations with
respect to such vesting) shall be treated as a share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time and
shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent LP the REIT Common
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)(i)_. As of the
Business Day immediately preceding the REIT Merger Effective Time, any
dividend equivalent rights associated with the Company RSUs that vest in
accordance with this _Section 3.3(b)_ (the " _Company Dividend Equivalents_
") shall automatically become fully vested and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the value of such Company Dividend
Equivalents as of immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, less
applicable withholding Tax obligations (the " _Company Dividend Equivalent
Payment_ "). As of the REIT Merger Effective Time, each holder of Company RSUs
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive from Parent LP the REIT Common Merger Consideration (including the
right, if any, to receive, pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 3.9_, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares into which
such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section
3.1(b)(i)_) and the Company Dividend Equivalent Payment in accordance with
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. As of the REIT Merger Effective
Time, the Company Equity Plans shall be terminated, and no further shares of
Company Restricted Stock, Company RSUs or other rights with respect to the
Company Common Stock shall be granted thereunder.

 



 

(d) _Manner of Effecting_. Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, the
Company and Parent LP agree that the Company shall, and shall be permitted
under this Agreement to, take all corporate action necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 3.3_.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement and subject to _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ and _Section 6.1(b)(iii)_, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the REIT
Merger Effective Time, the Company should split, combine or otherwise
reclassify the Company Common Stock, or make a distribution in Company Common
Stock, or otherwise change the Company Common Stock into any other securities
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Company Common Stock), or engage in a reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or exchange or other like change, then (without limiting any
other rights of Parent hereunder), the Common Exchange Ratio shall be ratably
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any such change. Without limiting the
other provisions of this Agreement and subject to _Section 6.2(b)(ii)_ and
_Section 6.2(b)(iii)_, if at any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the REIT Merger Effective Time, Parent should split,
combine or otherwise reclassify the Parent Common Shares, or make a
distribution in Parent Common Shares, or otherwise change the Parent Common
Shares into other securities (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Shares), or engage in a
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like
change, then the Common Exchange Ratio shall be ratably adjusted to reflect
any such change.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Exchange Fund;_ _Exchange Agent_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, Parent LP shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the REIT Common
Merger Consideration, the REIT Preferred Merger Consideration, and the
Aggregate Cash Consideration, as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_, _Section 3.4_
and _Section 3.9_. On or before the REIT Merger Effective Time, (i) Parent
shall transfer to Parent LP, and Parent LP shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent evidence of book-entry Parent Common Shares
and Parent Series A Preferred Shares sufficient to pay the REIT Common Merger
Consideration and the REIT Preferred Merger Consideration, and (ii) Parent LP
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, cash in
immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the Aggregate Cash
Consideration (such evidence of book-entry Parent Common Shares and book-entry
Parent Series A Preferred Shares and cash amounts, the " _Aggregate REIT
Merger Consideration_ " and such Aggregate REIT Merger Consideration as
deposited with the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, shares of Company Series A
Preferred Stock, shares of Company Restricted Stock, and Company RSUs. In the
event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 3.9_, Parent LP shall promptly deposit, or cause to
be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is
equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payments. Parent
LP shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make,
payments of the REIT Common Merger Consideration and the REIT Preferred Merger
Consideration and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or distributions
on Parent Common Shares in accordance with _Section 3.5(d)_ or otherwise
payable pursuant to _Section 3.9_ out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with
this Agreement and the REIT Merger Articles of Merger. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on cash
deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to the Surviving Entity of the
REIT Merger.

 



 

(b) _Share Transfer Books_. At the REIT Merger Effective Time, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Series A Preferred Stock. From and after the REIT Merger Effective
Time, persons who held shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
REIT Merger Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such
shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the REIT Merger
Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Entity of the REIT Merger for any reason shall be exchanged for the
REIT Common Merger Consideration or REIT Preferred Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred
Stock, respectively, formerly represented thereby.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

in no event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Entity
of the REIT Merger shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make
available for collection by hand):

 



 

(A) to each holder of record of one or more Certificates evidencing Company
Common Stock, (x) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "),

and which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as the Surviving Entity of the REIT Merger may reasonably specify,
and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the REIT Common Merger Consideration into which the number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates

Shares

by check or wire transfer to the surrendering holder),

 



 

(B) to each holder of record of one or more Certificates evidencing Company
Series A Preferred Stock, (x) a Letter of Transmittal, which shall specify

Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of

Shares in accordance with _Section 3.5(d)_, may be collected by hand by the
surrendering holder or by check or wire transfer to the surrendering holder),

 



 

(C) to each holder of a share of Company Restricted Stock, a certificate or,
at Parents option, evidence of book-entry Parent Common Shares representing
the REIT Common Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such award shall have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement, and

 



 

(D) to each holder of a Company RSU, a certificate or, at Parents option,

holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate or, at Parents option, evidence of book-entry Parent Common
Shares representing the REIT Common Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock or a certificate representing the REIT Preferred Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Series A Preferred Stock, as
applicable, formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_, plus, with respect to Company Common Stock,
any cash such holder is entitled to receive in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 3.9_ and any amounts that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of dividends or distributions on Parent Common Shares or
Parent Series A Preferred Shares, as applicable, in accordance with _Section
3.5(d)_, to be mailed, made available for collection by hand or delivered by

in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.5_, each Certificate of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred
Stock shall be deemed, at any time after the REIT Merger Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the REIT Common
Merger Consideration or the REIT Preferred Merger Consideration, as
applicable, as contemplated by this _Article III_. No interest shall be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the REIT Common
Merger Consideration or the REIT Preferred Merger Consideration payable upon

and (B) to issue and deliver to each holder of Book-Entry Shares a check or
wire transfer for any amounts payable in respect of dividends or distributions

_Section 3.5(d)_ and any other amount such holder is entitled to receive in
lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.9_, in each case, without
such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed Letter of
Transmittal to the Exchange Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be
canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
Book-Entry Shares on the REIT Common Merger Consideration or REIT Preferred

(b) _Fractional Units_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional New
Parent LP Common Units or Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the

internal accounting controls described in the following sentence are recorded,
stored, maintained and operated under means that are under the exclusive
ownership and direct control of the Company or the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership
and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a
materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls. The
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including
that: (i) transactions are executed only in accordance with managements
authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the financial statements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries; (iii) access to such assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements authorization; (iv) the reporting of such assets
is compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (v) accounts, notes
and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and
adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. The Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls, and
the Company has made available to Parent copies of any material written
materials relating to the foregoing. The Company has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15
promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company required to be included in reports filed
under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is recorded,
processed, summarized and made known to the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to material information required to be included in
the Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. The Company
has delivered or made available to Parent complete and accurate copies of
notices received as of the date hereof by the Company from its independent
auditor of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting since January 1, 2014 and
any other management letter or similar correspondence received as of the date
hereof by the Company since January 1, 2014 from any independent auditor of
the Company or any of the then-existing Subsidiaries of the Company. Since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer
of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act).

 



       
 

 



 

(d) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2016 (including any notes thereto), (ii) expressly
contemplated by or under this Agreement, including _Section 6.1_ hereof,
(iii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the most recent balance sheet set forth in the Company SEC
Filings made through and including the date of this Agreement, (iv) described
in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter, (v) arising or resulting from
a current Company Employment Agreement or (vi) that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Filings is the
subject of ongoing SEC review and the Company has not received as of the date
hereof any comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC
Filings which remain unresolved, nor has it received as of the date hereof any
inquiry or information request from the SEC as to any matters affecting the
Company which has not been adequately addressed. The Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies of all written comment letters
from the staff of the SEC received since January 1, 2014 through the date of
this Agreement relating to the Company SEC Filings and all written responses
of the Company thereto through the date of this Agreement. None of the Company
SEC Filings is the subject of any confidential treatment request by the
Company.

Section 4.10 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Section 4.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
correct list of each Company Benefit Plan, including each material Company
Employment Agreement (it being understood that any Company Employment
Agreement that includes severance is material). Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has any formal plan or commitment to create any additional
Company Benefit Plans or to modify, change, or terminate any existing Company
Benefit Plan. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent a copy of
each material Company Benefit Plan and each material Company Employment
Agreement (or a written description of the material provisions of each
unwritten Company Benefit Plan) and, with respect thereto, as applicable, (A)
all amendments, and currently effective trust (or other funding vehicle)
agreements, (B) the most recent summary plan description (and all summaries of
material modifications thereto) and actuarial report (or other financial

established, administered and funded in all material respects in accordance
with its terms and applicable Laws.

 



 

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code has either received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
as to its qualified status or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype
plan, in each case, that has not been revoked, and, to the Companys
knowledge, no event has occurred that would adversely affect the qualified
status of any such Company Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan that could result in material liability to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries. No suit, administrative proceeding,
action or other litigation has been brought, or to the knowledge of the
Company, is threatened against or with respect to any such Company Benefit
Plan or the assets thereof (other than routine benefits claims).

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, none of the Company, any Company Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates maintains, contributes to, is required to contribute to, or
participates in, or has ever during the past six (6) years maintained,
contributed to, been required to contribute to, or participated in, or
otherwise has any obligation or liability (including contingent liability) in
connection with: (i) an employee pension benefit plan subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (ii) a "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), a

arrangement which provides post-employment medical or welfare benefits, except
as required by applicable Law or that provides for continued benefits during
any post-termination severance period; or (iv) any plan established or
maintained outside of the United States or for the benefit of current or
former directors, employees or other individual service providers of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries residing outside the United States. None
of the Company, any Company Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has
incurred any Controlled Group Liability that has not been satisfied in full,
nor do any circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in
any Controlled Group Liability becoming a liability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates at or after the REIT Merger Effective Time.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in conjunction with another

any Company Benefit Plan or Company Employment Agreement with any current or
former director, employee or other individual service provider of the Company

former director, employee, or other individual service provider of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, (C) result in an obligation to fund benefits under

payments or benefits under a Company Benefit Plan or Company Employment
Agreement which would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code, or (E)
result in the Company or any Company Subsidiary having an obligation to "gross
up" or reimburse any person for any excise Tax imposed under Section 409A or
Section 4999 of the Code.

 



 

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no material funded benefit obligations of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries under a Company Benefit Plan or Company Employment
Agreement for which contributions have not been timely made or properly
accrued and there are no material unfunded benefit obligations under a Company
Benefit Plan or Company Employment Agreement that have not been accounted for
by reserves or otherwise reflected as may be required in the consolidated
financial statements in the Company SEC Filings made through and including the
date of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has used the
services of workers provided by third-party contract labor suppliers,
temporary employees, "leased employees" (within the meaning of Section 414(n)
of the Code) or individuals who have provided services as independent
contractors to an extent that would reasonably be expected to result in the
disqualification of any Company Benefit Plan or the imposition of penalties or
excise Taxes with respect to any Company Benefit Plan by the IRS, the
Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Authority.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Labor and Other Employment Matters_. Each of the Company,
Company LP and each Company Subsidiary is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws with respect to labor, employment, employee
classification, fair employment practices, unfair labor practices, terms and

4.11_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Company, Company LP or any
Company Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Company Property
Manager, is (or has been in the past five (5) years) a party to or bound by
any collective bargaining agreement, or party to or bound by any other
agreement with a labor union that contains a neutrality or accretion clause,
and no labor union has in the past five (5) years been certified to represent
any employee of the Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any Company Property Manager (or individual over
whom the Company, Company LP, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Property
Manager has a joint employment relationship), or has demanded, applied, or
threatened to demand or apply, to represent or is attempting to organize so as
to represent such employees, including any representation or certification
proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending
or threatened to be brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board
or any other labor relations tribunal or authority. There is no pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened work stoppage, slowdown, lockout,
material arbitration, or material grievance, labor strike, picketing, or other
material labor disputes against the Company, Company LP or any Company
Subsidiary, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Company Property Manager,
or at any Company Property, and no such activity has occurred in

 



      
 

 



 

the past three (3) years. None of the Company, Company LP or any Company
Subsidiary has any material outstanding liabilities under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended (the " _WARN
Act_ "), as a result of any action taken by the Company, Company LP or a
Company Subsidiary. None of the Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary
has any outstanding material liability in connection with the termination of

respective business substantially as it is being conducted as of the date

in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in possession of, or

conflicts, defaults or violations that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

Section 5.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Parent has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis) to,
the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required to be
filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and after
January 1, 2014 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Filings_ "). Each Parent SEC
Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if
amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case
may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and
(ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of
registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date of this Agreement, neither REIT Merger Sub nor Partnership Merger Sub
nor any other Parent Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the Parent SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated, if
applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared (except
as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such consolidated
financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations, shareholders equity
and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

 



 

(c) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the provisions of the Exchange Act and Securities
Act

 



      
 

 



 

relating thereto which under the terms of such provisions (including the dates
by which such compliance is required) have become applicable to Parent. Each
of the principal executive officer of Parent and the principal financial
officer of Parent has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or
15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with
respect to the Parent SEC Filings. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The records, systems,
controls, data and information of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries that are
used in the system of internal accounting controls described in the following
sentence are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means that are
under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls. Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (i) transactions
are executed only in accordance with managements authorization; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial
statements of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and to maintain
accountability for the assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries; (iii)
access to such assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
authorization; (iv) the reporting of such assets is compared with existing
assets at regular intervals; and (v) accounts, notes and other receivables and
inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are
implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis.
Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (i)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal controls, and Parent has made available to the Company copies of any
material written materials relating to the foregoing. Parent has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in
Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
material information relating to Parent required to be included in reports
filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
recorded, processed, summarized and made known to Parents principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the
knowledge of Parent, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting Parents principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in Parents
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Parent has delivered or made
available to the Company complete and accurate copies of notices

 



      
 

 



 

received as of the date hereof by Parent from its independent auditor of any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in Parents internal control
over financial reporting since January 1, 2014 and any other management letter
or similar correspondence received as of the date hereof by Parent since
January 1, 2014 from any independent auditor of Parent or any of the then-
existing Parent Subsidiaries. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
none of Parent, Parent LP or any other Parent Subsidiary has made any
prohibited loans to any director or executive officer of Parent (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act).

 



 

(d) None of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations
of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for
liabilities or obligations (i) reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries included in
Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016
(including any notes thereto), (ii) expressly contemplated by or under this
Agreement, including _Section 6.2_ hereof, (iii) incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since the most recent balance
sheet set forth in the Parent SEC Filings made through and including the date
of this Agreement, (iv) described in any section of the Parent Disclosure
Letter or (v) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) To the knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject
of ongoing SEC review and Parent has not received as of the date hereof any
comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Filings which
remain unresolved, nor has it received as of the date hereof any inquiry or
information request from the SEC as to any matters affecting Parent which has
not been adequately addressed. Parent has made available to the Company true
and complete copies of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC
received since January 1, 2014 through the date of this Agreement relating to
the Parent SEC Filings and all written responses of Parent thereto through the
date of this Agreement. None of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject of any
confidential treatment request by Parent.

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
Parent, Parent LP, REIT Merger Sub, Partnership Merger Sub or any other Parent
Subsidiary for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4
will, at the time such document is filed with the SEC, at any time such
document is amended or supplemented or at the time such document is declared

any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not

 



      
 

 



 

misleading. All documents that Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, to the extent
relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or other information supplied by
or on behalf of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for inclusion therein, will
comply as to form, in all material respects, with the provisions of the
Securities Act or Exchange Act, as applicable and the rules and regulations of
the SEC thereunder and each such document required to be filed with any
Governmental Authority (other than the SEC) will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of any applicable Law as to the information
required to be contained therein.

not apply to statements or omissions included in the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement to the extent based upon information supplied to Parent by or
on behalf of the Company.

Partnership Merger Sub to consummate the Mergers before the Outside Date;

 



 

(viii) enter into or amend any contract if such contract or amendment of a
contract would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Mergers;

 



       
 

 



 

(ix) fail to duly and timely file all material reports and other material

treated as a partnership or disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax
purposes;

 



 

(xi) take, or agree to commit to take, any action that would reasonably be

Section 6.3 _Preparation of Form S-4, Joint Proxy Statement and NYSE Listing;
Stockholder and Shareholder Meetings_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement, (ii) the Company and Parent
shall prepare, and Parent shall cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4,
which will include the Joint Proxy Statement as a prospectus, and (iii) Parent
shall prepare and cause to be submitted to the NYSE the application and other
agreements and documentation necessary for the listing of the Parent Common
Shares issuable in the REIT Merger on the NYSE. Each of the Company and Parent

filing, (x) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, (y) mail or
deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to its respective stockholders or
shareholders (as applicable) as promptly as practicable after

 



      
 

 



 

the Form S-4 is declared effective and (z) keep the Form S-4 effective for so
long as necessary to complete the Mergers and the other transaction
contemplated hereby. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the

Merger accepted by the NYSE as promptly as practicable following submission.
Between the date of this Agreement and the REIT Merger Effective Time, each
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain its NYSE listing. Each
of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself, its
Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock or other equity interests to
the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and
Joint Proxy Statement and the preparation and filing of the NYSE listing
application. The Form S-4, Joint Proxy Statement and the NYSE listing
application shall include all information reasonably requested by such other
party to be included therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly
notify the other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request
from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy
Statement, and shall provide the other with copies of all correspondence
between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other
hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect
to the Joint Proxy Statement, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to respond as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect
to the Form S-4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent (i) shall provide the
other an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and (ii)
shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by
the other. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4 the issuance of any stop
order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Shares issuable to Parent LP in connection with the REIT Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated. Parent shall also take any other action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of Parent Common
Shares in the REIT Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of its capital stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

 



 

(b) If, at any time prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, in the case of
the Form S-4, or receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and Parent
Shareholder Approval, in the case of the Joint Proxy Statement, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any

 



      
 

 



 

misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto, and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or
supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and, to the extent
required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to stockholders or shareholders of the Company and Parent, as
applicable. Nothing in this _Section 6.3(b)_ shall limit the obligations of
any party under _Section 6.3(a)_.

 



 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, but in any event prior to the date of the Companys 2017 annual
meeting of stockholders to elect directors of the Company, the Company shall,
in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws,
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the
Company and to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act.

that they give the Company Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the
Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by
_Section 6.5(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
6.3(c)_, if, on a date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled,
the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make
one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company
Stockholder Meeting to the extent permitted by Law; _provided_ , that the
Company Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is
more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Company Stockholder
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any postponement or adjournments
required by applicable Law); _provided_ further, the Company Stockholder
Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned on the date the Company Stockholder
Meeting is scheduled if the Company shall have received proxies in respect of
an aggregate number of Company Common Stock, which have not been withdrawn,
such that Company Stockholder Approval will be obtained at such meeting.

 



 

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent
Declaration of Trust and Parent Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be

Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall, through the Parent Board,
recommend to its shareholders that they give the Parent Shareholder Approval,
include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and solicit and use
its reasonable best

 



      
 

 



 

efforts to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3(d)_, if, on a date for which the
Parent Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares to obtain the Parent
Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have
the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Parent Shareholder Meeting to the extent permitted by Law; _provided_ , that
the Parent Shareholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is
more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Parent Shareholder
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any postponement or adjournments
required by applicable Law); _provided_ further, the Parent Shareholder
Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned on the date the Parent Shareholder
Meeting is scheduled if Parent shall have received proxies in respect of an
aggregate number of Parent Common Shares, which have not been withdrawn, such
that Parent Shareholder Approval will be obtained at such meeting.

 



 

(e) Each of the Company and Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Meeting on the
same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
contracts, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of the
Parent Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, to, afford to
the other party and to the Representatives of such other party reasonable
access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all
of their respective properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel, and records and, during such period, each of the Company and Parent
shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent
Subsidiaries, respectively, to, furnish reasonably promptly to the other party
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities Laws, and (ii) all other information (financial or otherwise)
concerning its business and properties and personnel as such other party may
reasonably request, subject to any privacy protections with respect to
information concerning personnel as may be required by applicable Law. Subject
to the terms of the Company Major Leases, Parent, at its own expense, shall
have the right to such reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice in order to prepare or cause to be prepared surveys,
inspections, engineering studies, environmental assessments and other tests,
examination or studies with respect to any Company Property that Parent deems
to be reasonably necessary, so long as such access does not unduly interfere
with the Companys ordinary conduct of business; _provided_ , that (x) neither
Parent nor any of its Representatives shall be entitled to conduct intrusive
soil testing or similar assessments at any Company Property without the
Companys prior written consent and (y) Parent shall indemnify the Company for
any losses, costs or damages caused by such access. Subject to the terms of
any applicable leases, the Company, at its own expense, shall have the right
to such reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice in order to prepare or cause to be prepared surveys,
inspections, engineering studies,

 



      
 

 



 

environmental assessments and other tests, examination or studies with respect
to any Parent Property that Company deems to be reasonably necessary, so long
as such access does not unduly interfere with Parents ordinary conduct of
business; _provided_ , that (x) neither the Company nor any of its
Representatives shall be entitled to conduct intrusive soil testing or similar
assessments at any Parent Property without Parents prior written consent and
(y) the Company shall indemnify Parent for any losses, costs or damages caused
by such access. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent
shall be required by this _Section 6.4_ to provide the other party or the
Representatives of such other party with access to or to disclose information
(x) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a Third
Party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after
the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such Third Party
to such access or disclosure), (y) the disclosure of which would violate any
Law (including without limitation employee privacy Laws) or fiduciary duty (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of any Law or fiduciary duty) or (z) that is
subject to any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the
withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege).

 



 

(b) The Company shall cooperate and participate, as reasonably requested by
Parent from time to time and to the extent consistent with applicable Law, in
Parents efforts to oversee the integration of the parties operations in
connection with, and taking effect upon consummation of, the Mergers,
including providing such reports on operational matters and participating on
such teams and committees as Parent may reasonably request (including customer
billing and other data files for the purpose of system integration and testing
as well as compensation and payroll data files for the purpose of payroll
system integration and testing with respect to employees of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries), and including providing reasonable notice to, and
consulting with, Parent in connection with the Companys review and approval
of any budgets or operating plans pursuant to any JV Agreements.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(d) Each of the Company and Parent agree to give prompt written notice to the
other upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any
event or circumstance relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which (i) would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, (ii) would reasonably be
expected to make any of the conditions in _Article VII_ to not be satisfied
or (iii) is an action, suit, proceeding, inquiry

 



      
 

 



 

or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, threatened which questions or challenges the validity of this
Agreement or that could otherwise adversely impact the ability of the parties
hereto to consummate the Mergers; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations and warranties of any party or
relieve any party of any breach of any such representation or warranty or
affect the remedies available to the party receiving notice hereunder. The
failure to deliver any such notice, in and of itself, shall not result in the
failure of, or otherwise affect, any of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_.

 



 

Section 6.5 _No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 6.5_, during the Interim
Period, neither the Company nor Parent shall, and each of the Company and
Parent shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, and its and their
officers and directors, managers or equivalent not to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any other Representatives of itself or its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer or request
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal (provided that for purposes of this _Section 6.5(a)_, the references
in the definition of " _Acquisition Proposal_ " to "twenty percent (20%)"
shall be deemed to be "five percent (5%)" (an " _Inquiry_ ")), (ii) engage in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Third Party any
nonpublic information in connection with, or otherwise cooperate in any way
with, or knowingly facilitate in any way any effort by, any Third Party in
connection with, any Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry, (iii) approve or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share
exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar definitive agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance
with this _Section 6.5_) providing for or relating to an Acquisition Proposal
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (v) propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not, and
shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries, and its and their officers and
directors, managers or equivalent not to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause any other Representatives of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any activity of the
foregoing clauses (i)-(v) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any
Inquiry that was made by any Third Party prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.5(a)_, at any time
prior to obtaining the requisite Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent
Shareholder Approval, as applicable, the Company or Parent, as applicable,
may, in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal by
a Third Party received after the date of this Agreement (that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 6.5_) (i) furnish nonpublic information to
such Third Party (and such Third Partys Representatives) making an
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) prior to so
furnishing such information, the applicable party receives from the Third
Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) any nonpublic
information

 



      
 

 



 

concerning such party and its Subsidiaries that is provided to such Third
Party shall, to the extent not previously provided to the other party, be
provided to such other party prior to or simultaneously with providing it to
such Third Party), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such
Third Party (and such Third Partys Representatives) with respect to the
Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii): (x) the
Company Board or the Parent Board, as the case may be, determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Superior Proposal, and (y) the Company Board or the Parent Board, as the
case may be, determines in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the duties of its directors or trustees under applicable Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that in each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), such
Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in violation of this _Section 6.5_.

 



 

(c) The Company and Parent shall notify the other party promptly (but in no
event later than one (1) Business Day) after receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for nonpublic information relating to such party or
any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party, or any Inquiry from any Person
seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such party relating to a
possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed
in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Third Party making the
Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and the material terms and conditions of any
Inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any
related documentation or correspondence). The Company and Parent shall also
promptly, and in any event within one (1) Business Day, notify the other,
orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data
to any person in accordance with _Section 6.5(b)_ and keep the other party
informed of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all material
documentation or correspondence relating thereto.

 



 

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.5(d)_, neither the Company Board
nor Parent Board nor any committee thereof, shall (i) withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify), in a manner adverse to the Company, on the one hand, or Parent on the
other hand, the Company Recommendation or the Parent Recommendation, as the
case may be, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend (or publicly propose to approve,
adopt or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the
Company Recommendation or the Parent Recommendation, as the case may be, in
the Joint Proxy Statement or any Schedule 14D-9, as applicable, (iv) fail to
publicly recommend against any Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business
Days of the request of the other party, and reaffirm the Company
Recommendation or the Parent Recommendation, as applicable, within ten (10)
Business Days of the request of the other party (any of the actions described
in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this _Section 6.5(d)_, an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), or (v) approve, adopt, declare advisable or
recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve, adopt, declare
advisable or recommend), or cause or permit the Company or Parent, as
applicable, to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this
_Section 6.5_).

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
shall be permitted to, and at any time prior to obtaining the Parent
Shareholder Approval, the Parent Board shall be permitted to, (x) terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement, including an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, with respect to a Superior Proposal, subject to
compliance with _Section 6.5(e)_ and _Section 8.3_, if such board (A) has
received an Acquisition Proposal that, in the good faith determination of such
board, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, constitutes,
a Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and giving effect to all of
the adjustments which may be offered by the other party pursuant to, _Section
6.5(e)_, and (B) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law, or (y) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change if, after the date of this Agreement the Company
or Parent, as applicable, receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 6.5_ and that such board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, and such board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Except in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, neither the Company
Board nor the Parent Board shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement or
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted under _Section 6.5(d)_
unless (i) the Company or Parent, as the case may be, has provided a written
notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to the other party that it
intends to take such action and describing the material terms and conditions
of, attaching a complete copy of, the Superior Proposal that is the basis of
such action, and identifying the Third Party making such Superior Proposal
(ii) during the five (5) Business Day period following the Companys or
Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, as the case may be, the
other party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with the
receiving party in good faith (to the extent the receiving party desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal, and (iii) following the end of the five (5) Business Day period, the
Company Board or the Parent Board, as the case may be, shall have determined
in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors,
taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by
receiving party in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise,
that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any material amendment to the
financial terms or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal, and the notifying party shall
be required to comply again with the requirements of this _Section 6.5(e)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that references to the five (5) Business Day period
above shall then be deemed to be references to a three (3) Business Day
period.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit either party or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to
its

 



      
 

 



 

respective stockholders or shareholders (as applicable) a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or
modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any
other provision of this Agreement, and provided, further, that any such
disclosure that addresses the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, with
respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless the Company Board or the Parent Board,
as applicable, in connection with such communication publicly states that its
recommendation with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of
such party, without disclosing any Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(g) Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
respective Subsidiaries and its and their officers and directors, managers or
equivalent, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any of their
other Representatives, to immediately cease any existing discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The parties shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause all Third Parties who have been furnished confidential
information regarding either party in connection with the solicitation of or
discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the six (6) months prior
to the date of this Agreement to promptly return or destroy such information
(to the extent that the Company is entitled to have such information returned
or destroyed). Moreover, neither the Company nor Parent shall release any
Third Party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change made by either the
Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, unless such (i) Adverse
Recommendation Change is with respect to a Superior Proposal, (ii) the party
making the Adverse Recommendation Change has otherwise complied with this
_Section 6.5_ (including the notice obligations of _Section 6.5(e)_) and
(iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, (A) the Company
shall cause the approval of the REIT Merger to be submitted to a vote of its
stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting and (B) Parent shall cause the
approval of the Parent Share Issuance to be submitted to a vote of its
shareholders at the Parent Shareholder Meeting.

 



 

(i) Without the prior written consent of each of the Company and Parent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), approval of the
REIT Merger (in the case of the Company) or approval of the Parent Share
Issuance (in the case of Parent) is the only matter, other than (i) any say-
on-golden parachute vote that may be required pursuant to Section 14A(b)(2) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder and (ii) a proposal to approve
the adjournment of the Company Stockholder Meeting or the Parent Shareholder
Meeting, as applicable, if necessary, to

 



      
 

 



 

solicit additional proxies, in the event that there are not sufficient votes
at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting or the Parent Shareholder
Meeting, as applicable, to obtain the approval of the Companys stockholders
or Parents shareholders, as applicable, which either the Company or Parent,
as applicable, shall propose to be acted on by its respective stockholders or
shareholders (as applicable) at the Company Stockholder Meeting or the Parent
Shareholder Meeting, as applicable.

 



 

(j) Prior to the termination of this Agreement, neither party shall submit to
the vote of its respective stockholders or shareholders (as applicable) any
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(k) For purposes of this Agreement, except as otherwise may be expressly
qualified in context by reference to the applicable definition:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer for (or
expression by a Third Party that it is considering or may engage in), whether
in one transaction or a series of related transactions, (i) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) any sale,
lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, sale of equity interests,
share exchange, joint venture, business combination or otherwise, of any
assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including equity interests of
any Subsidiary) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole as
determined on a book-value basis, (iii) any issue, sale or other disposition
of (including by way of merger, consolidation, joint venture, business
combination, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into, such
securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of
the Company, (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer in which any Person or
"group" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) shall seek to acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding
shares of any class of voting securities of the Company, (v) any
recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
type of transaction with respect to the Company in which a Third Party shall
acquire beneficial ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company or (vi)
any transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the
foregoing transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall not include (x) the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (y) any proposal or offer relating to any
existing purchase option, right of first offer, right of first refusal or
buy/sell provision contained in any agreement to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party.

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the references in the
definition of " _Acquisition Proposal_ " to "twenty percent (20%)" shall be
deemed to be "fifty percent (50%)") made by a Third Party on terms that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial and legal advisors, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and any other aspects of the transaction described in such
proposal, including the identity of the Person making such proposal, as well
as any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent,
REIT Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub in response to such proposal or
otherwise, to be more favorable to the Company and the Companys stockholders
(solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, when either the term Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal is used with respect to Parent, references to "the Company"
shall be deemed to mean "Parent," references to the "Company Subsidiaries"
shall be deemed to mean "Parent Subsidiaries," references to "Company Board"
shall be deemed to mean "Parent Board," references to "Parent" shall mean "the
Company" and references to "REIT Merger Sub" and "Partnership Merger Sub"
shall be disregarded.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including _Section 6.5_), each of the Company and Parent shall (and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to)
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law
or pursuant to any contract or agreement to consummate and make effective, as
promptly as practicable, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including (i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause
the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Authorities or other Persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the making of all necessary registrations
and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the
taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every
impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Mergers so as to enable the Closing to occur

 



      
 

 



 

as soon as reasonably possible, _provided_ , _however_ , that none of Parent,
Parent LP or any Parent Subsidiary nor the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall be required to take any action that would be materially adverse to the
business or financial condition of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and
(iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or
submissions and will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in responding to
any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including immediately informing the
other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each
other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications
between either party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this
Agreement. To the extent practicable, and permitted by a Governmental
Authority, each party hereto shall permit Representatives of the other party
to participate in meetings (whether by telephone or in person) with such
Governmental Authority.

 



 

(c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding
anything in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and
the Company shall give (or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries or the Company
Subsidiaries, respectively, to give) any notices to Third Parties, and Parent
shall use, and cause each of its Affiliates to use, its reasonable best
efforts, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with Parent in its efforts, to obtain any third-party consents not covered by
_Section 6.6(a)_ and _Section 6.6(b)_ that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Mergers as may be determined by Parent or the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any approval or consent from
any Third Party pursuant to this _Section 6.6(c)_ shall not be considered a
condition to the obligations of Parent, REIT Merger Sub and Partnership Merger
Sub to consummate the Mergers.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received by
such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement,
the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that the
applicable closing conditions would reasonably expected to be incapable of
being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,

 



      
 

 



 

covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving such party or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which relate to this Agreement, the Mergers
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless such settlement involves no admission of liability and no
restrictions or other obligations binding on Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries other than the payment of money and the amount
of such settlement shall be fully covered by insurance proceeds. Parent shall
give the Company the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and
settlement of any shareholder litigation against Parent and/or its directors
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without the Companys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless such settlement involves no admission of liability and no restrictions
or other obligations binding on Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries other than the payment of money and the amount of such settlement
shall be fully covered by insurance proceeds.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements or filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any such
press release or make any such public statements or filings prior to obtaining
the other parties consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without
obtaining the other parties consent, issue such press release or make such
public statements or filings as may be required by Law, Order or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange or the applicable provisions of any
listing agreement of any party hereto. If for any reason it is not practicable
to consult with the other party before making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, then
the party making such statement shall not make a statement that is
inconsistent with any press release or public statements or filings, if any,
to which the other party had previously consented.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent, REIT Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub agree that all rights
to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the REIT Merger Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the REIT Merger Effective Time (including any matters arising in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing
in favor of Indemnitees as

 



      
 

 



 

provided in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or each of the Company
Subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational or governing documents) or in any
indemnification agreement of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or other
applicable contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall survive
the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. Parent and the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity to) (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance
expenses to, Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by them in
their capacities as such at any time prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time,
to the fullest extent required by: (x) the Company Charter or Company Bylaws,
or the articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational or governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, in
each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (y) any indemnification
agreement of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or other applicable
contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or (z) applicable Law,
and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions referenced
in subsections (i)(x) and (i)(y) above in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.9(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the REIT Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the REIT Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to): (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arises out of or pertains to (x) any action or omission or
alleged action or omission in such Indemnitees capacity as a director,
officer, partner, member, trustee or employee of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or (y) this Agreement and any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Mergers; and (ii) pay in advance of the
final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
the expenses (including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.9(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity not to)
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section
6.9(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not include an
admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Entity
(i) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior
written consent and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnitee to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is
prohibited by applicable Law, in which case

 



      
 

 



 

the Indemnitee shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity the
amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

 



 

(c) Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the REIT
Merger Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-
cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of
the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the "
_D andO Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period
of at least six (6) years from and after the REIT Merger Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the REIT
Merger Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies and with policy limits no less than the limits on the Companys
existing policies as long as the annual premium does not exceed 250% of the
annual premium under the Companys existing policies. If the Company or the
Surviving Entity for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies
as of the REIT Merger Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Entity shall continue
to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after
the REIT Merger Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date
hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof,
or (ii) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide,
for a period of not less than six (6) years after the REIT Merger Effective
Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with
comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or
prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, that
is no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company (which may be
provided under Parents DandO Insurance policy) or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay
an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the REIT Merger Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies shall be Third Party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.9_. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or
representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in successfully
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.9_.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.9_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person or any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, or the Surviving
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee or any employee with the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries listed in _Section 4.12(a)(iv)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (each, an " _Existing Indemnification Right_ "). To the
extent of any conflict between an Existing Indemnification Right and the
rights granted to Indemnitees pursuant to this _Section 6.9_, the provision
or provisions more favorable to the Indemnitee shall control.

 



 

(f) Any Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 6.9_,
upon learning of any such indemnifiable claim, shall promptly notify the
Surviving Entity thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
Parent or the Surviving Entity of any liability it may have to such
Indemnitee, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
Surviving Entity. In the event of any such threatened or actual indemnifiable
claim (whether asserted or arising at or before or after the REIT Merger
Effective Time), (A) Parent or the Surviving Entity shall have the right to
assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), and Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be liable to such
Indemnitee for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Entity elects not to assume
such defense, or counsel for the Indemnitee advises that there are issues that
raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Entity and the
Indemnitee, the Indemnitee may retain counsel satisfactory to him or her, and
Parent or the Surviving Entity shall pay all documented fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnitee within twenty (20) Business Days after
statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the
Surviving Entity shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (f) to pay for
only one firm of counsel for all Indemnitees in connection with an
indemnifiable claim (selected by a majority of the applicable Indemnitees) in
any jurisdiction except to the extent that any two or more Indemnitees have a
conflict of interest in such claim, and (B) the Company and, after the REIT
Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity to) promptly pay expenses in advance of the final disposition
of any such threatened or actual claim to each Indemnitee to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, subject to the receipt of an undertaking
by such Indemnitee to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither the Company nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which prior written
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company and the Surviving Entity shall have
no obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and non-appealable, that indemnification by them of such
Indemnitee in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.7_ to
the contrary, this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
Mergers indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries,
and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of
its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.9_. The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees
the payment and performance of the Surviving Entitys obligations pursuant to
this _Section 6.9_.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide, to
employees of the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the REIT Merger Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ") whose employment
with the Surviving Entity, Company Subsidiaries and its Affiliates is
terminated in a severance-qualifying manner during the one (1)-year period
following the REIT Merger Effective Time, (i) cash severance benefits that are
not less favorable than the cash severance benefits, if any, and (ii) other
severance benefits substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other
severance benefits, if any, in each case, that would have been provided to
such Company Employee pursuant to the terms of the Company Benefit Plans
maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
(or, for the avoidance of doubt, the terms as they shall be amended pursuant
to _Section 6.10(c)_) upon such a severance-qualifying termination of
employment.

 



 

(b) For purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and with respect to
vacation, other paid time off and severance only, determination of level of
benefits under the compensation and benefit plans, programs, agreements and
arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Parent Subsidiaries, the Company
Subsidiaries, the Surviving Entity and any of its Subsidiaries or any
respective Affiliate thereof providing benefits to any Company Employees after
the Closing, and in which such Company Employees did not participate prior to
the REIT Merger Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ ") (but excluding any New
Plan that is established after the Closing that does not recognize service
prior to its adoption), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor
employer) before the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was
entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Benefit Plan, except where such credit would result in a duplication
of benefits or retroactive application. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately

 



      
 

 



 

before such replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions and actively-at-work requirements would apply under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan, and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan
year prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time to be taken into account under
such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-
payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. For the avoidance of doubt and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent may elect to continue
the Company Benefit Plans or to permit Company Employees to commence
participation in New Plans, in Parents discretion and at such times as are
determined by Parent.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into an amendment to the applicable Company
Employees Change in Control and Severance Agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ with each Company Employee who is party to a
Change in Control and Severance Agreement with the Company and the Company LP
as set forth in _Section 6.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Entity to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no current or former director, officer, employee or other individual
service provider or any other Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of
this _Section 6.10_, and nothing herein shall amend, or be construed as an
amendment to, any Company Benefit Plan, any Parent Benefit Plan, any New Plan
or any other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The parties shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of
all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any
real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock
transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees
and any similar taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein (together with any related interests, penalties or
additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to
minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(b) Parent and Parent LP shall deliver to the Company and Polsinelli PC (or
other counsel to the Company) a tax representation letter, signed by each of
the officers of Parent and of Parent LP principally responsible for legal,
tax, and financial matters, in each case, in their capacities as officers of
Parent and not in their individual

 



      
 

 



 

capacities, dated as of (i) the effective date of the Form S-4 (if requested
by Parent in connection with the delivery of a tax opinion as an exhibit to
the Form S-4), and (ii) the Closing Date (such tax representation letter, the
" _Parent Tax Letter_ "). The Parent Tax Letter shall be in a form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Parent Tax Letter shall
include language explicitly permitting Hogan Lovells US LLP (or other counsel
to the Company) to rely on the representations set forth therein for purposes
of delivering an opinion as to the REIT status of Parent (including the
opinion described in _Section 7.2(e)_ hereof).

 



 

(c) The Company and Company LP shall deliver to Parent and Hogan Lovells US
LLP (or other counsel to Parent) a tax representation letter, signed by each
of the officers of the Company and of Company LP principally responsible for
legal, tax, and financial matters, in each case, in their capacities as
officers of the Company and not in their individual capacities, dated as of
(i) the effective date of the Form S-4 (if requested by Parent in connection
with the delivery of a tax opinion as an exhibit to the Form S-4), and (ii)
the Closing Date (such tax representation letter, the " _Company Tax Letter_
"). The Company Tax Letter shall be in a form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent. The Company Tax Letter shall include language explicitly
permitting Hogan Lovells US LLP (or other counsel to Parent) to rely on the
representations set forth therein for purposes of delivering an opinion as to
the REIT status of Parent (including the opinion described in _Section
7.3(e)_ hereof).

 



 

(d) All Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with _Section
2.5_ of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Control_ _of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of the Company prior to the REIT Merger Effective
Time. Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and the Company Subsidiaries operations.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Dividends_.

 



 

(a) In the event that the Closing Date is to occur prior to the end of the
then current dividend period of the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
then each of the Company and Parent shall declare a dividend to the respective
holders of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Shares, the record date, and
payment date (to the extent practicable), for which shall be the close of
business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Dividend Date_ "), in each case, subject to funds being legally available
therefor.

 



 

(b) The per share dividend amount payable by the Company with respect to the

indenture governing each series of Notes with the consent of the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding securities of such series, to

any "Change of Control" (as defined in the applicable indenture) occurring in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Notes
COC Consents_ ") and (ii) to amend certain terms of the indenture governing
each series of Notes (the " _Indenture Amendments_ ") as determined by Parent
and in compliance with applicable law (including SEC rules and regulations)
and the provisions of the indentures governing the applicable series of Notes
and as set forth in the consent solicitation documents sent to holders of such
series of Notes to become effective substantially simultaneously with the
Closing and no earlier than the REIT Merger Effective Time, which amendments
may include the elimination of all or substantially all of the restrictive
covenants and certain other provisions contained in the indenture governing
such series of Notes that can be eliminated upon the favorable vote of the
holders of a majority of the principal amount thereof (the " _Other Consents_
" and, together with the Notes COC Consents, the " _Consent Solicitations_ ").
Any documentation relating to any Consent Solicitation (including all
amendments or supplements thereto) (the " _Solicitation Documents_ ") and all
material requested to be published or mailed to the holders of the Notes in
connection with any Consent Solicitation shall be subject to the prior review
of (which review shall be made

parties hereby agree that promptly upon expiration of any Consent
Solicitation, assuming the requisite consents have been received with respect
to such series of Notes, Company LP shall execute a supplemental indenture to
the indentures governing each series of Notes and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the trustee under each such indenture and lenders to enter
into such supplemental indenture prior to or substantially simultaneously with
the execution thereof by Company LP. Any Indenture Amendments contemplated by
any Consent Solicitation (other than any Notes COC Consent) shall revert to
the form in effect prior to the effectiveness of any Indenture Amendments and
be of no further effect if the Closing does not occur.

 



 

(c) If at any time prior to the completion of any Consent Solicitation any
information should be discovered by the Company, Company LP, Parent or Parent
LP that the Company, Company LP, Parent or Parent LP reasonably believes
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Solicitation
Documents, so that the Solicitation Documents shall not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company describing such information shall be disseminated by
or on behalf of Company LP to the holders of the applicable Notes.

 



 

(d) Parent shall select and pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any
dealer manager, information agent, depositary, trustee or other agent retained

acceptable to the Company), and pay all consent fees (or provide Company LP
with the funds required therefor in advance of the required payment thereof)
payable in connection with any Consent Solicitation. At Parents expense, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause Company LP and
the other Company Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to,
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary or
reasonably required in connection with the Consent Solicitations, including,
without limitation, (i) executing supplemental indentures to the indentures
governing each series of Notes, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to cause
the trustee under each such indenture to enter such supplemental indenture
prior or substantially simultaneously with execution thereof by Company LP and
(iii) providing the information necessary to distribute the applicable
Solicitation Documents to the holders of the applicable series of Notes. If
requested by Parent in writing in connection with any COC Consent with respect
to the Notes, the Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries shall use
their reasonable best efforts, or shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their counsel to, deliver legal opinions in customary form and scope
relating to the Company, Company LP, the Company Subsidiaries and/or the
indentures governing the Notes required in connection with any Other Consent.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
6.14_, neither the Company nor Company LP shall be required to take any action

 



      
 

 



 

in connection with any Consent Solicitation that either believes, after
consultation with counsel, could reasonably be expected to cause the Company
or Company LP to violate (i) federal or state securities laws or (ii) the
provisions of the indentures governing the applicable series of Notes. It is
expressly agreed by the parties hereto that the failure to obtain the consent
of the holders of the Notes in connection with any Consent Solicitation shall
not be deemed to be a breach by the Company or Company LP under this Agreement
or a failure of any condition hereto.

be owned pursuant to such ownership limitations; provided that any such Person
delivers to the Parent Board such representations, warranties and covenants to
ensure that the limited exemption provided to such Person satisfies the

result of the failure to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval; or

 



 

(B) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that:

 



 

(i) payment by any party of any portion of the Expense Amount pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ or _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_, as applicable, shall not
relieve such paying party of any subsequent obligation with respect to the
Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, that may
arise under _Sections 8.3(a)(i)_ or _8.3(b)(i)_ , except that, to the extent
any such obligation does arise, it shall be adjusted to an amount equal to the
Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, less all of
the Expense Amount previously paid (if any) to such other party;

 



 

(ii) the party required to pay any Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination
Fee or Expense Amount shall make such payment by wire transfer of same day
funds to an account designated by the party entitled to receive such Company
Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Expense Amount within two (2)
Business Days of such termination (or in the case of clauses (C) and (D) of
_Sections 8.3(a)(i)_ and _8.3(b)(i)_ , two (2) Business Days of the date of
the consummation of such transaction arising from any such Acquisition
Proposal), but under no circumstances earlier than one (1) full Business Day
after receipt of appropriate wire transfer instructions from the party
entitled to payment;

 



 

(iii) under no circumstances shall either the Company or Parent be required to
pay the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on
more than one occasion.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination
Fee, as applicable, is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will

 



      
 

 



 

compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in
which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision, (iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in
order to obtain such payment, either the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for
the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_, such paying party
shall pay the other party its costs and Expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of ten percent (10%)
for the period from the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law and (iv) if the Company Termination Fee or the
Parent Termination Fee is payable, receipt of the Company Termination Fee or
the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries, as applicable, other than for any willful or intentional breach
of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) If the Company or Parent is required to pay a Company Termination Fee,
Parent Termination Fee or Expense Amount, such Company Termination Fee, Parent
Termination Fee or Expense Amount shall be paid into escrow on the date such
payment is required to be paid by such party pursuant to this Agreement by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow account designated
in accordance with this _Section 8.3(e)_. In the event that the Company or
Parent is obligated to pay a Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee
or Expense Amount, the amount payable to the other party in any tax year shall
not exceed the lesser of (i) the Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination
Fee or Expense Amount, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be
paid to such other party without causing it to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year,
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying
Income_ "), and such receiving party has income from unknown sources during
such year in an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying
Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in each case as determined by such partys independent accountants,
plus (B) in the event such receiving party receives either (x) a letter from
the paying partys counsel indicating that the receiving party has received a
ruling from the IRS as described in _Section 8.3(f)_ or (y) an opinion from
its outside counsel as described in _Section 8.3(f)_, an amount equal to the
excess of the Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Expense
Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above.

 



 

(f) To secure the Company or Parents obligation to pay any amounts payable
pursuant to _Section 8.3(e)_, such paying party shall deposit into escrow an
amount in cash equal to the Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or
Expense Amount with an escrow agent selected by the paying party and
reasonably acceptable to the receiving party on such terms (subject to this
_Section 8.3_) as shall be mutually agreed

 



      
 

 



 

upon by the paying party, the receiving party and the escrow agent. The
payment or deposit into escrow of the Company Termination Fee, Parent
Termination Fee or Expense Amount pursuant to this _Section 8.3(f)_ shall be
made at the time the paying party is obligated to pay the receiving party such
amount pursuant to _Section 8.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall
provide that the Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Expense
Amount in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the receiving
party unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the
following: (i) a letter from the receiving partys independent accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the
receiving party without causing such party to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and the receiving party has
income from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to 1% of its
gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to the receiving party, or (ii) a letter from
the receiving partys counsel indicating that (A) the receiving party received
a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by such party of the Company
Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Expense Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B) the receiving partys
outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by
such party of the Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Expense
Amount should either constitute Qualifying Income should be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in
which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Company
Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Expense Amount to the receiving
party. The paying party agrees to amend this _Section 8.3_ at the reasonable
request of the receiving party in order to (i) maximize the portion of the
Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Expense Amount that may be
distributed to the receiving party hereunder without causing the paying party
to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code,
(ii) improve the receiving partys chances of securing a favorable ruling
described in this _Section 8.3_ or (iii) assist the receiving party in
obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in
this _Section 8.3_. Any amount of the Company Termination Fee, Parent
Termination Fee or Expense Amount that remains unpaid as of the end of a
taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this _Section 8.3_, _provided_
, _however_ , that the obligation of the paying party to pay the unpaid
portion of the Company Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Expense
Amount shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five (5)
years from the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by the Parent Board and the Company Board at any time
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and prior to the
REIT Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be (a) any amendment
of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to
be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock, or
which by

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires
the further approval of the stockholders of the Company or shareholders of
Parent without such further approval of such stockholders or shareholders (as
applicable), or (b) any amendment or change not permitted under applicable
Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by each of the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject
to the proviso of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement or
condition contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Company LP, Parent, Parent
LP, REIT Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Fees and_ _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and
Parent shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing and filing of
the Form S-4 and the printing, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy
Statement, other than attorneys and accountants fees.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article,
Section, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section
of, or a Schedule or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated.
The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor Laws. References to a person are also to its successors and
permitted assigns. All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the
United States of America.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by any of

 



      
 

 



 

the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto (except to the Surviving
Entities).

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire_ _Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
schedules, annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter, the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the provisions of
_Section 6.9_, this Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with _Section 8.5_ without notice or liability to any
other person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Accordingly, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. In no event shall the exercise
of any partys right to seek specific performance pursuant to this _Section
9.8_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the right of a party to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement by facsimile transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
