RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement;

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,

ARTICLE IV 

   

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
 Exchange of Certificates  

  

 4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Company: 

  

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and Shares owned by the Company, and (ii) Shares that are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each, an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $12.00 per Share (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), subject to the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, and each certificate formerly representing Shares owned by Dissenting Stockholders shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f). 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be 

   ##### 

  

    

outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist. 

  

 (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select an independent paying agent approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article IV, cash amounts in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make the aggregate payments required pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not provided for in such Paying Agent agreement. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the aggregate amount of the Per Share Merger Consideration represented by such holders Certificates (after giving effect to any required Tax (as defined in Section 5.1(n) withholdings). Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholding) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is 

   ##### 

  

    

presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

  

 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount, if any, in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article IV. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 5.1(d)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature. 

  

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be customarily required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

  

 (f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other 

   ##### 

  

    

instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company
relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Law relating to Tax. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 4.3 _Treatment of Stock Plan_. 

  

 (a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the Stock Plan (as defined in Section 5.1(b)(i)), vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and each such Company Option, vested or unvested, shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company Option times (y) the excess, if any, of the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required under applicable Law to be withheld with respect to such payment. To the extent that applicable Tax amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

  

 (b) _Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Stock Plan and any other Company Benefit Plans, other than Company Options (the " _Company Awards_ "), vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and each such Company Award, vested or unvested, shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably 

   ##### 

  

    

practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the
number of Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time times (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, if the
Company Award provides for payments to the extent the value of the Shares
exceed a specified reference price, the amount, if any, by which the Per Share
Merger Consideration exceeds such reference price), less applicable Taxes
required under applicable Law to be withheld with respect to such payment. To
the extent that applicable Tax amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be
remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Awards in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be. 

  

 (c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.3(a) and (b), including any action to approve the disposition of Company Options and Company Awards in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement to the extent necessary to exempt such disposition under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Stock Plan as of the Effective Time and to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company, Parent or of the Surviving Corporation to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options or Company Awards. 

  

 (d) _Notice_. As soon as practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 6.3), the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of Company Options or Company Awards a letter approved in advance by Parent describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Options or Company Awards pursuant to this Section 4.3 and providing instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company Options or Company Awards. 

  

 4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted. 

   #####

 (A) changes in the economy or financial markets in the United States; 

   

 (B) changes that are proximately caused by factors generally affecting the healthcare information technology industry;

Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has been required to file information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed plan year. It is not reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to any Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be materially increased by application of Section 412(l) of the Code. The Company has not provided, and is not required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the financial
condition, whether or not as a result of a change in the funding method, of
such Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year.

_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the Company shall have used commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or

 (a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, the U.S. employees of the Company will continue to be provided with pension and welfare benefits under employee benefit plans (but excluding equity based benefits) that are at a minimum substantially comparable in the aggregate to those currently provided by the Company to such employees or at a minimum generally comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries as elected by Parent in its sole discretion. On and after the Closing Date, Parent will cause the employee benefit plans in which the employees of the Company are eligible to participate (the " _New Plans_ ") to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder, except for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, service by the U.S. employees of the Company as if such service 

   ##### 

  

    

were with Parent to the same extent such service was credited under a
comparable plan of the Company and to the extent that such time period is
recognized under the terms of such plan of Parent. In addition, Parent shall
cause, to the extent permissible under the New Plans (it being understood
that Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the New
Plans to permit the following), (i) the waiver of all pre-existing condition
exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under
any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an employee under
any comparable Company Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date, and (ii) any
covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any employee (or
covered dependent thereof) of the Company to be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (x) be treated
as an amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (y) give any third
party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9, or (z)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan, or (B) retain
the employment of any particular employee. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall (i) cause to be amended the employee benefit plans and arrangements of it to the extent necessary to provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence participation therein following the Closing unless Parent or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation, and (ii) cause the Company 401(k) Plan to be terminated effective at least one day prior to the Closing. Parent shall cause a tax-qualified defined contributions retirement plan established or maintained by Parent or an Affiliate (the " _Buyer Plan_ ") to accept eligible rollover distributions from the Company 401(k) Plan with respect to any account balance distributed to employees on or after the Closing Date. Rollovers of outstanding loans from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Buyer Plans shall be permitted. 

  

 (c) The Company agrees to cause each of its officers and directors to repay any outstanding liens or notes to the Company prior to the Effective Time.

 6.11 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company (in each case, when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under Delaware Law and its certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification); and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set forth under Delaware Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws shall be made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; _provided_  

   ##### 

  

    

that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest
shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of
any such matter; and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend for such policies a premium amount in excess of the amount set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and, provided further that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Following the six-year anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, agree to amend, modify, cancel or terminate its DandO Insurance to the detriment of the Indemnified Parties or any of their eligible beneficiaries. 

  

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the 

   ##### 

  

    

Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.11. 

  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and other Persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.11(b) hereof. 

  

 (f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other Persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" referred to in Section 6.11(c)) hereof under this Section 6.11 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the DGCL or the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or under any applicable Contracts, Laws and any indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company, which rights shall not be affected by Section 9.7. 

  

 (g) The obligation and liability of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11 shall be joint and several. 

  

 (h) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors or employees, it being understood that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.11 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any such policies. 

  

 6.12 _Other Actions by the Company_. 

   

 (a) _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. 

  

 (b) _Section 16 Matters_. The board of directors of the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act to exempt the conversion to cash of all Shares, Company Options and Company Awards by officers and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or by employees or directors of the Company who may become an officer or director of Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall provide to counsel for the other party for its review copies of such resolutions to be adopted by its board of directors prior to such adoption and the Company shall provide Parent with such information as shall be 

   ##### 

  

    

reasonably necessary for Parents board of directors to set forth the
information required in the resolutions of Parents board of directors.

 9.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.11 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) only, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create any third party beneficiaries or otherwise confer upon any Person other than the 

   ##### 

  

   

parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including, without
limitation, the right to rely upon the representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein. 

   

 9.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

   

 9.10 _Parent Undertaking_. Parent agrees to take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement. Parent unconditionally guarantees to the Company the full and complete performance by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be liable for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this Agreement. This is a guarantee of payment and performance and not collectibility. Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any proceeding first against Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in connection with the performance of its obligations set forth in this Section 9.10. Parent further waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by Law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is available to Merger Sub, in connection with such performance. 

   

 9.11 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. 

   

 9.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (x) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision, and (y) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

   

 9.13 _Interpretation; Construction_. 

   

 (a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." 

  

 (b) The parties to this Agreement have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Inclusion of information in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an admission or otherwise imply that such information (or any other information or matter) is material to the properties, assets, liabilities, business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or to the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or has had or would be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Disclosure of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed or constitute a conclusion or an admission that the Company or its Affiliates have any obligation or liability to any third party with respect to such matters. 

  

 9.14 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may assign, by prior written notice to the Company, any of their rights or obligations hereunder to a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Guarantor, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Parent and Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Guarantor as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall not materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement and that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

    #####
