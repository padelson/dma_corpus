the surviving or resulting corporation at or after the Effective Time pursuant
to the provisions of the DGCL).

 



 

Section 2.2 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Article X_, _Article XI_ and _Article XII_, other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the consummation of the
Merger (the " **Closing** "), but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions, the parties shall cause the filings contemplated by
_Section 2.3_ to be made: (a) no later than the tenth day (or next Business
Day if such day is not a Business Day) following the last day of the month
after such satisfaction or waiver; or (b) on such other date to which Guaranty
and the Company may agree in writing (the " **Closing Date** ").

 



 

Section 2.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and upon the satisfaction
or waiver of all requirements of Applicable Law and the conditions specified
in this Agreement, Guaranty and the Company shall, in accordance with the
provisions of the DGCL and the CBCA, file with the Secretary of State of
Delaware and the Secretary of State of Colorado, respectively, a certificate
of merger and articles of merger, as applicable, and such other documents as
may be required to effectuate the Merger (collectively, the " **Merger
Filings** "). The Merger shall become effective, and the effective time of the
Merger shall occur at the date and time specified in the Merger Filings (the "
**Effective Time** ").

 



 

Section 2.4 _Charter Documents and Facilities of Continuing Company_. At the
Effective Time and until thereafter amended in accordance with Applicable Law,
the Certificate of Incorporation of Continuing Company shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of Guaranty as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Until altered, amended or repealed as therein provided, the
Bylaws of Continuing Company shall be the Bylaws of Guaranty as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Unless and until changed by the board
of directors of Continuing Company, the main office of Guaranty as of the
Effective Time shall become the main office of Continuing Company. Until
thereafter changed in accordance with law or the Charter Documents of
Continuing Company, all corporate acts, contracts, approvals and
authorizations of the Company and Guaranty and their respective shareholders
and stockholders, boards of directors, committees elected or appointed
thereby, officers and agents, which were valid and effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be taken for all purposes as the acts, plans,
policies, contracts, approvals and authorizations of Continuing Company and
shall be as effective and binding thereon as the same were with respect to the
Company and Guaranty, respectively, as of the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Board of Directors and Officers of Continuing Company_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.5(b)_, at the Effective Time and until thereafter

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Compensation, Nominating and Governance

this Agreement through the Effective Time, with personal connections to the
local Colorado civic

 



      
 

 



 

and business communities, and shall meet any qualifications under Guarantys
Charter Documents and board policies, copies of which have been previously
provided to the Company, and Applicable Law. Upon approval of such Person by
the Guaranty Board, such director shall be invited to join and shall be
appointed to the board of directors of Continuing Company after the Effective
Time. Such director shall be entitled to indemnification in connection with
his or her role as a director to the same extent as currently offered to other
directors on the board of directors of Continuing Company. Provided such
director continues to meet the standards for directors of Continuing Company,
such director may be nominated for reelection to the board of directors of
Continuing Company at the next two annual stockholder meetings of Continuing
Company immediately following the Effective Time, and Continuing Companys
proxy materials with respect to such annual meetings shall include the
recommendation of the board of directors of Continuing Company that its
stockholders vote to reelect such director to the same extent as
recommendations are made with respect to other directors on the board of
directors of Continuing Company.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time and until thereafter changed in accordance with
Applicable Law or the Charter Documents of Continuing Company, the officers of

and to any type of property and choses in action shall be transferred to and
vested in Continuing Company by virtue of such Merger without reversion or

occurred, but subject to any existing Liens thereon. The Merger shall have all
other effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and Article 111 of the
CBCA.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Liabilities of Continuing Company_. At the Effective Time,
Continuing Company shall be liable for any liabilities, Indebtedness,
obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses (including court costs
and reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and expenses
associated with investigating, preparing for and participating in any
litigation or proceeding, including all appeals), interest, penalties, amounts
paid in settlement, Taxes, fines, judgments or assessments, in each case,
whether known or unknown, whether asserted or unasserted, whether absolute or
contingent, whether accrued or unaccrued, whether liquidated or unliquidated,
and whether due or to become due (collectively, " **Liabilities** ") of the
Company and Guaranty. All Liabilities and contracts of the Company and of
Guaranty, respectively, matured or unmatured, whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise, and whether or not reflected or reserved against on
balance sheets, books of account, or records of the Company or Guaranty, as
the case may be, shall be those of Continuing Company and shall not be
released or impaired by the Merger. All rights of creditors and other obligees
and all Liens on property of either the Company or Guaranty shall be preserved

Section 2.8 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the

meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations.

 



 

Section 2.9 _Possible Alternative Structures_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, Guaranty
and the Company may mutually agree to revise the structure of effecting the
acquisition of the Company, provided, however, that: (a) there are no adverse
federal or state income Tax consequences to the Companys shareholders as a
result of the modification (including no impact upon the opinions of counsel
related to Tax matters to be delivered

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this Agreement); (b) the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the
Closing Distribution to be paid to the holders of Company Stock under this
Agreement is not thereby changed in kind, value or reduced in amount and the
delivery of such consideration will not be delayed; (c) the benefits to be
received by the Companys directors, officers and employees under this
Agreement are not diminished; and (d) such modification will not delay
materially or jeopardize the receipt of any regulatory approvals or other
consents and approvals relating to the consummation of the Merger or otherwise
cause any condition to Closing set forth in _Article X_, _Article XI_ or
_Article XII_ not to be capable of being fulfilled.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
Continuing Company shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable
or proper to: (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in
Continuing Company its right, title or interest in or to or under any of the
rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; or (b) otherwise carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, Continuing Company and its proper officers and directors or their
designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either of the Company or its Subsidiaries all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, all such other acts and things as may be
necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm Continuing
Companys right, title or interest in or to or under any of the rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **III.** **MERGER CONSIDERATION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each share of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time including shares issued
pursuant to the cashless exercise of Company Stock Options, but excluding the
KSOP Shares (collectively, " **Company Closing Shares** "), shall, subject to
the conditions hereinafter stated, automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist and, along with any certificate representing such share,
shall represent only the right to receive (except any Dissenting Shares, which
shall have the rights specified in _Section 3.6_): (i) a number of shares of
Guaranty Common Stock equal to the quotient, rounded to the nearest hundred
thousandth, obtained by dividing 6,533,914, as such number may be adjusted
pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)(ii)_ or _Section 9.1(i)(ii)_ (the " **Aggregate
Stock Consideration** ") by the number of Company Closing Shares (the " **Per
Share Stock Consideration** "), subject to the escrow of shares of Guaranty
Common Stock provided for in _Section 8.6_, plus cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Guaranty Common Stock as determined in accordance with
_Section 3.1(c)_; and (ii) an amount of cash equal to $35,000,000, as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.2_ (" **Aggregate Cash Consideration** "),
minus the KSOP Cash Consideration (the " **Aggregate Non-KSOP Cash
Consideration** "), divided by the number of Company Closing Shares (the "
**Per Share Cash Consideration** " and, together with the Per Share Stock
Consideration, the " **Per Share Merger Consideration** "), all as estimated
and calculated in good faith as of the Calculation Date in accordance with the
process illustrated on _Company Schedule 3.1(a)_. For clarification of
purposes, the parties agree that _Company Schedule 3.1(a)_ sets forth the
parties good faith estimate of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and certain
components as if the Calculation Date had occurred on February 29, 2016,
subject to adjustments consistent with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each share of Company Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each
share of Company Stock owned by Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than: (i) shares of Company Stock held, directly or indirectly, in
trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary
capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties; and (ii) shares of
Company Stock

 



      
 

 



 

held in respect of a debt previously contracted) (the " **Treasury Shares** ")
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist without
any conversion and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Guaranty will
not issue any fractional shares of Guaranty Common Stock otherwise issuable
pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional shares,
Guaranty shall pay to each former holder of Company Stock otherwise entitled
to receive such fractional share an amount of cash determined by multiplying:
(i) $16.07 by (ii) the fraction of a share of Guaranty Common Stock which such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Section 3.1_.

 



 

(d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the KSOP, each KSOP Share, excluding any Dissenting Shares, shall,
subject to the conditions hereinafter stated, automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist and, along with any certificate representing
such share, shall represent only the right to receive an amount of cash equal
to the Per Share Transaction Value, subject to the escrow of a portion of the
KSOP Cash Consideration, as provided for in _Section 8.6_; provided, however,
that any such cash consideration provided with respect to KSOP Encumbered
Shares shall first be used to completely pay the KSOP Loan pursuant to
_Section 3.4_.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Adjustment of Merger Consideration for Tangible Book Value_.

 



 

(a) If the Tangible Book Value on the Calculation Date is less than
$79,000,000 (the " **Minimum Tangible Book Value** "), the Aggregate Cash
Consideration will be reduced by an amount, rounded to the nearest dollar,
equal to the difference between the Minimum Tangible Book Value and the
Tangible Book Value on the Calculation Date.

 



 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Tangible Book Value** " shall equal
the sum of the capital stock, capital surplus, retained earnings and current
earnings (if not already included in retained earnings) of the Company
(excluding unrealized securities gains or losses, on a consolidated basis, as
determined pursuant to GAAP and the contra-equity effect of the KSOP Loan).
For purposes of calculating Tangible Book Value, the Company shall deduct the
following amounts to the extent not accrued, or paid and expensed, or
otherwise recorded through current earnings by the Company (without
duplication), each on or prior to the Calculation Date: (i) the book value of
all intangible assets, including goodwill; (ii) the estimated 2016 ad valorem
and property Taxes of the Company and Bank, allocable (on a per diem basis) to
the portion of calendar year 2016 ending on the Calculation Date; (iii) the
After-Tax amount of all Transaction Expenses, as allowed by the Code; (iv) the
aggregate After-Tax amount of any Change in Control Payments, including any
payments to be made pursuant to the Termination Agreements; (v) the estimated
After-Tax amount of any Future Benefit Payments due on or after the Closing
Date; (vi) the estimated After-Tax amount of any and all costs incurred in the
termination and liquidation of the KSOP pursuant to _Section 8.7_; (vii) any
amount required to be added to the ALLL pursuant to _Section 6.9_; (viii) the
book value of any Company Real Property Subject to Environmental Termination;
(ix) the book value of any Owned Real Property Subject to Title Termination;
and (x) such other amounts as are agreed upon by the Company and Guaranty in
writing. Tangible Book Value shall be estimated and calculated as of the
Calculation Date. For clarification of purposes, the parties agree that
_Company Schedule 3.1(a)_ sets forth the parties good faith estimate of the
Tangible Book Value as if the Calculation Date had occurred on January 31,
2016. Tangible Book Value shall not be adjusted downward for any adjustment
required by Guaranty pursuant to _Section 6.7_.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. Prior to and effective as of
the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as are necessary
to cause to be exercised or terminated each Company Stock Option, whether or
not vested or exercisable, issued and outstanding

 



      
 

 



 

immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Home State Bancorp 2005
Stock Option Plan (the " **Company Stock Plan** ").

 



 

Section 3.4 _Treatment of Encumbered Shares_. With respect to shares of
Company Stock that: (a) have been issued to the Home State Bank 401(k)
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " **KSOP** "); and (b) remain subject to
the KSOP Pledge Agreement or any other Lien, whether in favor of the Company
as lender under that certain loan agreement between Community Bank of Pleasant
Hill (Missouri) as the trustee of the KSOP trust and the Company or otherwise,
a portion of the KSOP Cash Consideration shall be paid to the Company (or
other creditor in whose favor the encumbrance runs) and applied to the
Indebtedness secured by the KSOP Loan or such Lien so as to effect a release
of the KSOP Loan or such Lien.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Dilution_. If Guaranty changes (or the Guaranty Board sets a
related record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a change in)
the number or kind of shares of Guaranty Common Stock outstanding by way of a
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification,
reorganization or similar transaction, then the Aggregate Stock Consideration
(and any other dependent items) will be adjusted proportionately to account
for such change to provide to the holders of Company Stock the same economic
effect contemplated by this Agreement prior to such change.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Each share of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of which has
not voted in favor of the Merger and who has properly demanded and perfected
such holders dissenters rights of appraisal in accordance with Section
7-113-101, _et seq._ , of the CBCA, is referred to herein as a " **Dissenting
Share**." Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
Dissenting Share shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration or the Per Share Transaction Value, as
applicable, pursuant to this _Article III_ and shall be entitled only to such
rights as are available to such holder pursuant to the applicable provisions
of the CBCA. Each holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive the
value of such Dissenting Shares held by such holder in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the CBCA, provided that such holder complies with the
procedures contemplated by and set forth in the applicable provisions of the
CBCA. If any holder of any Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses
such holders dissenters rights under the applicable provisions of the CBCA,
each such Dissenting Share shall be deemed to have been converted into and to
have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration or the Per Share Transaction Value, as
applicable, without any interest thereon in accordance with the provisions of
this _Article III_. The Company shall give Guaranty: (a) prompt notice of any
written demands for fair value, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to Applicable Law relating to shareholders
demands for fair value; and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for fair value under the CBCA or any other
Applicable Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Guaranty, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for fair
value of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) On the Closing Date, Guaranty shall deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Exchange Agent, to be held in trust for the holders of shares of Company
Stock: (i) book entry shares of Guaranty Common Stock representing the
Aggregate Stock Consideration, via the direct registration system, less shares
of Guaranty Common Stock which may be deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant
to _Section 8.6_; and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to make the
payment of the Aggregate Cash Consideration, as may be adjusted pursuant to
the adjustment set forth in _Section 3.2_, and less cash which may be
deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 8.6_ (such shares and
cash deposited with the

 



       
 

 



 

Exchange Agent being hereinafter referred to as the " **Exchange Fund** ").
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided
in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Exchange Agent, as soon as practicable, but with the intent to be no
later than 15 days after the Closing Date, shall mail to each record holder of
an outstanding certificate or certificates which as of the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Stock (the " **Certificates** "), a letter of
transmittal that will specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and contain instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share
Merger Consideration or the KSOP Cash Consideration, as applicable, into which
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificates will have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the " **Transmittal
Materials** "). All Transmittal Materials shall be provided to the Company for
review and comment no later than 15 days prior to the Closing Date. Upon
surrender to and acceptance by the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with the Transmittal Materials duly completed and executed, (i) the holder of
such Certificate except for the KSOP shall be entitled to receive in exchange
for each share of Company Stock represented thereby the Per Share Merger
Consideration, as may be adjusted pursuant to the adjustment set forth in
_Section 3.2_ and less a pro rata portion of any Escrow Amount deposited with
the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 8.6_, and such Certificate shall
forthwith be cancelled, and (ii) the KSOP shall be entitled to receive the
KSOP Cash Consideration, less a pro rata portion of any Escrow Amount
deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 8.6_, and such
Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
with respect to the shares of Guaranty Common Stock or cash payable upon
surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 3.7_, each Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares or Treasury Shares) shall represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration or the
KSOP Cash Consideration, as applicable, with respect to each share of Company
Stock evidenced by the Certificate.

 



 

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to shares of Guaranty Common Stock and payable to the holders thereof
shall be paid to the holder of a Certificate until such holder surrenders such
Certificate and duly completed and executed Transmittal Materials to the
Exchange Agent in accordance with this _Section 3.7_. After the surrender of
a Certificate and duly completed and executed Transmittal Materials in
accordance with this _Section 3.7_, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive any such dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon,
which had become payable after the Effective Time with respect to the shares
of Guaranty Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate, including
dividends on any shares of Guaranty Common Stock included in the Escrow
Amount.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer ledger of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company of the shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) If any outstanding Certificates and duly completed and executed
Transmittal Materials related thereto are not surrendered prior to the date on
which the Per Share Merger Consideration applicable to such Certificates as a
result of the Merger would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, the unclaimed Per Share Merger Consideration
applicable to such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned
property and any other Applicable Law, become the property of Continuing
Company (and to the extent not in Continuing Companys possession shall be
paid by the Exchange Agent to Continuing Company), free and clear of any and
all claims or interest of any Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Continuing Company, Guaranty, Guaranty Bank, the Exchange Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any

 



      
 

 



 

former holder of Company Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(f) If any shares of Guaranty Common Stock are to be issued in a name other
than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be appropriately endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form
(reasonably satisfactory to Guaranty) for transfer, and that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of
Guaranty Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 



 

(g) If a Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed in a form reasonably acceptable to Guaranty and the
Exchange Agent, and, if required by Guaranty or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Guaranty or the Exchange
Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Continuing Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share
Merger Consideration or KSOP Cash Consideration, as applicable, with respect
to each share of Company Stock formerly evidenced by the Certificate. Guaranty
shall use its Best Efforts to resolve lost Certificate issues with Company
shareholders to avoid undue expense for shareholders.

 



 

(h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund held by the Exchange Agent in respect of
any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Guaranty upon demand.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Continuing Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Per Share Merger Consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the applicable withholding agent,
in its reasonable discretion, determines it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the former holder of Company Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



 

 **IV.** **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Subject to the Company Schedules referred to in this _Article IV_, the
Company represents and warrants to Guaranty as set forth below.

 



 

Section 4.1 _Corporate Existence and Power_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Colorado and a bank holding company
registered under the BHC Act. The Company has all corporate powers and
authority and all material governmental licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals required to own or lease all of its properties and to
carry on its business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where
failure to be so qualified could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is
qualified to do business in the State of Colorado. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has ever had any non-U.S. operations or

 



      
 

 



 

conducted any business outside of the United States of America. The Company
has prior to the date hereof delivered to Guaranty true and complete copies of
its Charter Documents as currently in effect. The Company is not in violation
of any of the provisions of its Charter Documents.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on _Company Schedule 4.1(b)_ : (i) the Company does
not directly engage in and has not directly engaged in any business or
operations; (ii) the Company does not directly own any assets other than the
equity interests in Bank; (iii) the Company is not a party to any contract
relating to the business of any of its Subsidiaries; and (iv) the Company does
not own or have any right to use any asset or property (whether real,
personal, tangible, intangible or otherwise) used or held for use in, or
related to, the business of any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Corporate Authorization_.

 



 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company and Bank, as
applicable, of this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which the
Company or Bank is a party and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby are within their corporate powers, and, except
for the Company Shareholder Approval, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and Bank. Other than the
Company Shareholder Approval, no other votes, approvals or consents of the
holders of any of the Companys capital stock are necessary in connection with
the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by a
Transaction Document. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
the other parties hereto and thereto, each of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which the Company or Bank is a party constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of the Company and Bank, as applicable, and is
enforceable against the Company and Bank, as applicable, in accordance with
its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by any
Enforceability Exceptions.

 



 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Company Board has unanimously: (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) are fair to and in the best interests of the
shareholders of the Company; (ii) approved this Agreement; (iii) adopted and

Company or Bank and all Regulatory Reports filed by Bank with the

 



      
 

 



 

appropriate Governmental Authority after the date of this Agreement. All such
financial information will be prepared from the books and records of the
Company and Bank and will fairly present the consolidated financial position,
results of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows of the Company at
the dates and for the periods indicated in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, except that unaudited

extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company will promptly following
Guarantys request furnish Guaranty with all information concerning the
Company, Bank and the holders of Company Stock required for inclusion in: (i)
any application, filing, statement or document to be made or filed by Guaranty
with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement during the pendency of this Agreement; and (ii)
any filings with the SEC, including the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement, and any applicable state securities authorities, including the
opinion of counsel as to tax matters required to be filed as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement. The Company shall respond promptly to Guaranty to any
comments relating to the Company or Bank from the SEC or its staff. The
Company will cooperate reasonably with Guaranty in the filing of any
applications or other documents necessary to complete the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company agrees to, upon the reasonable
request of Guaranty, furnish to Guaranty a written letter or statement
confirming the accuracy of the information with respect to the Company or Bank
contained in any report or other application or statement referred to in this
Agreement, and confirming that the information with respect to the Company or
Bank contained in such document or draft was furnished by the Company
expressly for use therein or, if such is not the case, indicating the
inaccuracies contained in such document or indicating the information not
furnished by the Company expressly for use therein.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Standstill Provision_. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither the Company nor Bank shall, and the Company agrees to use its Best
Efforts to cause its and Banks directors, officers, employees, agents and
Representatives not to directly or indirectly: (a) entertain, solicit,
encourage, induce or facilitate inquiries, offers or the making or
announcement of any proposal or other action designed to facilitate any
inquiries or proposals that constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal; or (b) provide any information to or negotiate
with any other Person any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees to notify
Guaranty of any such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal within three Business
Days of its receipt, and to provide reasonable detail as to the identity of
the proposed acquirer and the nature of the transaction proposed by the
Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of or the taking of any
action inconsistent with any of the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.5_ by any Representative of the Company or Bank, whether or not such
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or Bank, shall be
deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section 6.5_ by the Company.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Transition_.

 



 

(a) Commencing following the date of this Agreement, and in all cases subject
to Applicable Law, the Company shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to reasonably cooperate with Guaranty and Guaranty Bank to facilitate the
integration of the parties and their respective businesses. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Closing and consistent with the
performance of their day-to-day operations and the continuous operation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, the Company
shall cause the employees and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
reasonably cooperate with Guaranty and Guaranty Bank in performing tasks
reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

required in connection with such integration, including requesting reasonable
support from its outside contractors and vendors. The Company shall and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with Guaranty and Guaranty Bank
in minimizing the extent to which any contracts designated by Guaranty
continue in effect following the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.6(a)_, the Company shall
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use Best Efforts to provide data
processing, item processing and other processing support or outside
contractors to assist Guaranty and Guaranty Bank performing all tasks
reasonably required to result in a successful conversion of the data and other
files and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the production
environment of Guaranty and Guaranty Bank, when reasonably requested by
Guaranty and use its Best Efforts to ensure that a successful conversion will
occur at the time (on or after the Effective Time) designated by Guaranty;
provided, however, that if requested by Guaranty, the Company shall take all
steps reasonably necessary to allow Guaranty and Guaranty Bank to convert to
the Companys existing production environment. Among other things, the Company
shall cause its Subsidiaries to: (i) reasonably cooperate with Guaranty and
Guaranty Bank to establish a mutually agreeable project plan to effectuate the
conversion; (ii) use its Best Efforts to have the Company and its
Subsidiaries outside contractors continue to support both the conversion
effort and its on-going needs until the conversion can be established; (iii)
reasonably provide, or use its Best Efforts to obtain from any outside
contractors, all data or other files and layouts reasonably requested by
Guaranty or Guaranty Bank for use in planning the conversion, as soon as
reasonably practicable; (iv) provide reasonable access to the personnel and
facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries as set forth in _Section 6.3_
and, with the consent of its outside contractors, its outside contractors
personnel and facilities, to reasonably enable the conversion effort to be
completed on schedule; and (v) give notice of termination, conditioned upon
the completion of the transactions contemplated by this _Section 6.6_, of the
contracts of outside data, item and other processing contractors or other
third party vendors when directed to do so by Guaranty provided any such
termination will not be effective until at or after the Effective Time.
Guaranty agrees that all actions taken pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall
be taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption to the customary business
activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Conforming Accounting Adjustments_. If requested by Guaranty, the
Company shall, and shall cause Bank to, consistent with GAAP, immediately
prior to Closing, make such accounting entries as Guaranty may reasonably
request in order to conform the accounting records of the Company and Bank to
the accounting policies and practices of Guaranty. No such adjustment shall by
itself constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation or failure to satisfy
any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision or
constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement or be an acknowledgment
by the Company or Bank: (a) of any adverse circumstances for purposes of
determining whether the conditions to Guarantys obligations under this
Agreement have been satisfied; (b) that such adjustment is required for
purposes of determining satisfaction of the condition to Guarantys
obligations under this Agreement set forth in _Section 10.3_; or (c) that
such adjustment has any bearing on the Aggregate Merger Consideration or
Closing Distribution. No adjustment required by Guaranty shall: (i) require
any prior filing with any Governmental Authority; or (ii) violate any
Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Takeover Statutes_. At all times prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall: (a) take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that no
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and (b) if any
Takeover Statute becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, take all reasonable action
necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, or if necessary, to challenge the validity or
applicability of any Takeover Statute as now or hereinafter in effect.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.9 _Allowance for Loan Losses_. If the ALLL is less than the Minimum
Allowance Amount on the Calculation Date, the Company shall take or cause to
be taken all action necessary to increase the ALLL as of the Closing Date to
an amount equal to the Minimum Allowance Amount.

 



 

Section 6.10 _2015 Financial Statements; Interim Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) As soon as they are available to the Company, but in any event no later
than March 31, 2016 the Company shall provide Guaranty with the audited
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and the related audited
consolidated statement of income, changes in shareholders equity and cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the " **2015 Financial

will: (i) be true, accurate and complete in all respects; (ii) have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP; and (iii) fairly present in conformity with
GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the financial position
of the Company as of the date thereof and its results of operations,
shareholders equity and cash flows for the period then ended. As of the date
of the 2015 Financial Statements, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will have incurred any material liability (whether or not
accrued, fixed, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be
disclosed) except as set forth therein or as otherwise disclosed in the
Company Schedules. All information set forth in the 2015 Financial Statements
(including the notes thereto) relating to Tax matters will be true and
complete.

 



 

(b) On or before the fifth day following the Calculation Date, the Company
shall provide Guaranty with the Companys consolidated financial statements
presenting the financial condition of the Company and Bank as of the
Calculation Date and the Companys consolidated results of operations and
changes in shareholders equity for the period from January 1, 2016 through
the Calculation Date (the " **Interim Financial Statements** "). The Interim
Financial Statements shall: (i) fairly present in all material respects the
assets, liabilities and Tangible Book Value of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates of the Interim Financial Statements; and (ii) be
prepared in a manner consistent with the Company Financial Statements, in
accordance with GAAP and Applicable Law, and reflect all period-end accruals
and other adjustments. The Interim Financial Statements shall be accompanied
by a certificate of the Companys Chief Financial Officer, dated as of the
Closing Date, to the effect that such financial statements continue to reflect
accurately, as of the Calculation Date, the financial condition of the
Company. The Interim Financial Statements shall also reflect accruals for all
fees incurred or expected to be incurred in connection with the Merger
(whether or not doing so is in accordance with GAAP) and shall be accompanied
by a certificate of the Companys Chief Financial Officer, dated as of the
Closing Date, to the effect that they meet the requirements of this _Section
6.10(b)_.

 



 

(c) Each day between the Calculation Date and the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Guaranty with daily updated financial information of the Company
and Bank consisting of general ledger updates and such other information as
Guaranty shall reasonably request.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Third Party Consents_. The Company will use its Best Efforts,
and Guaranty shall reasonably cooperate with the Company at the Companys
request, to obtain all Company Required Approvals and such other waivers or
consents as otherwise required to be obtained from any Person in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, including such
consents set forth in _Company Schedule 4.4_ , and such waivers and consents
shall be in such form and content as is approved by Guaranty and the Company.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Bank Merger_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
cause Bank to reasonably cooperate with Guaranty and Guaranty Bank as
necessary in conjunction with all approvals, filings, and other steps
necessary to cause the consummation of the Bank Merger after the Effective
Time.

 



      
 

 



 

In furtherance of the foregoing, to the extent not previously approved, the
Company shall work with the board of directors of Bank to approve the Bank
Merger and the related Bank Merger Agreement in connection with the execution
of this Agreement, and shall vote all of the shares of Bank voting stock held
by the Company for the Bank Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, the Bank
Merger shall occur after the Merger, and shall be conditioned upon regulatory
approval, the Company Shareholder Approval and the Guaranty Stockholder
Approval.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Environmental Investigation_.

 



 

(a) Guaranty and its consultants, agents and Representatives shall have the
right, upon execution of a mutually agreeable site access agreement, to enter
the Company Real Property (at Guarantys sole cost and expense), but not the
obligation or responsibility, to inspect any Company Real Property, including
conducting asbestos surveys and sampling, environmental assessments and
investigation, and other non-invasive or non-destructive environmental surveys
and analyses (" **Environmental Inspections** ") on or prior to 45 days after
the date of this Agreement, but such 45-day period shall be extended to 60
days with respect to any property for which the Company had not delivered or
made available the Environmental Information prior to the date of this
Agreement. If, as a result of any such Environmental Inspection, further
investigation (a " **Secondary Investigation** ") including test borings,
soil, water, asbestos or other sampling, is deemed desirable by Guaranty,
Guaranty shall: (i) notify the Company of any Company Real Property for which
it seeks to conduct such a Secondary Investigation and the reasons for such
Secondary Investigation; (ii) submit a work plan to the Company for such
Secondary Investigation, for which Guaranty agrees to afford the Company the
ability to comment on and Guaranty agrees to reasonably consider all such
comments (and negotiate in good faith any such comments); and (iii) conclude
such Secondary Investigation, on or prior to 60 days after the date of receipt
of the Companys comments. Guaranty shall give reasonable notice to the
Company of such Environmental Inspections and Secondary Investigations, and
the Company may place reasonable restrictions on the time and place at which
such Environmental Inspections and Secondary Investigations may be carried
out.

 



 

(b) Guaranty shall not have any liability to the Company or Bank or
responsibility of any nature whatsoever for the results, conclusions or other
findings related to any Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or
other environmental survey, except to the extent that Guaranty, its
consultants, agents or representatives cause any environmental liability.
Guaranty promptly shall deliver to the Company copies of any final
environmental report, engineering report, or property condition report
prepared by Guaranty or any third party pursuant to this _Section 6.13_. Any
results or findings of any Environmental Inspections will not be disclosed by
Guaranty to any third party not affiliated with Guaranty, unless Guaranty is
required by Applicable Law to disclose such information or the Company
provides written consent to disclose such information (which shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). If this Agreement is
terminated, then except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, reports to
any Governmental Authority of the results of any Environmental Inspection,
Secondary Investigation or other environmental survey shall be made by the
Company in the exercise of its sole discretion and not by Guaranty. Guaranty
shall make no such report prior to Closing unless required to do so by
Applicable Law, and in such case will give the Company reasonable prior notice
to enable the Company to review and comment on such proposed report and to
make such report on behalf of the Company, at Companys sole discretion.

 



 

(c) If: (i) the results of such Environmental Inspection, Secondary
Investigation or other environmental survey are disapproved by Guaranty
because the Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or other
environmental survey identifies violations or potential violations of
Environmental Laws that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or Bank; or (ii) any past or present events,
conditions or circumstances require further

 



       
 

 



 

investigation, remedial or cleanup action under Environmental Laws involving
an expenditure reasonably expected to exceed $200,000 or that could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Bank
(together, the " **Environmental Condition** "), then Guaranty may terminate
this Agreement with respect to such parcel of Company Real Property subject to
the Environmental Condition (the " **Company Real Property Subject to
Environmental Termination** "), but not as to any other Company Real Property
or any other matter in this Agreement, in which event this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect with respect to all other matters in this
Agreement (including all other Company Real Property except the Company Real
Property Subject to Environmental Termination), and this Agreement shall be
deemed to be modified as necessary to reflect the change in the Company Real
Property to be acquired by Guaranty and Guaranty and the Company shall remove
such Company Real Property Subject to Environmental Termination from the
assets of the Company prior to the Calculation Date; provided, however, if
such Company Real Property Subject to Environmental Termination is a Required
Owned Real Property, Guaranty may elect to terminate this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Company agrees to make available upon request to Guaranty and its
consultants, agents and Representatives all documents and other materials
relating to environmental conditions of any Company Real Property, including
the results of other environmental inspections and surveys to the extent such
documents are in the possession or reasonable control of the Company. The
Company also agrees that all engineers and consultants who prepared or
furnished such reports may discuss such reports and information with Guaranty
and, at Guarantys cost and expense, shall be entitled to certify the same in
favor of Guaranty and its consultants, agents and Representatives and make all
other data available to Guaranty and its consultants, agents and
Representatives.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Title Insurance_.

 



 

(a) In preparation for the Closing, as soon as reasonably practicable and in
no event later than 10 Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the
Company will request, with respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property, a
title commitment on the ALTA Form 2006 Owners Policy of Title Insurance (each
a " **Title Commitment,** " collectively, the " **Title Commitments** ")
issued by Land Title Guaranty Company (" **Title Company** "), committing to
insure Guarantys title in such parcel of Owned Real Property for the amount
listed on _Company Schedule 6.14(a)_. The Company will request on each Title
Commitment that the so-called "standard printed exceptions" are deleted from
the Title Commitment so that Guaranty will have extended coverage. The Company
will deliver or cause the Title Company to deliver to Guaranty, promptly after
the Closing Date, an owners title insurance policy issued by the Title Company
insuring Guarantys title to each Parcel of Owned Real Property consistent
with the applicable Closing Title Commitment (as defined below) (each a "
**Title Policy,** " collectively, the " **Title Policies** "), subject only to
the Permitted Exceptions. The Company will pay the premium for each owners
standard policy at Closing and Guaranty will pay the costs associated with
deletion of the standard printed exceptions or any endorsements to the
standard Title Policy required by Guaranty.

 



 

(b) Guaranty shall review the Title Commitments and if (i) any Title
Commitment discloses that any party other than the Company or Bank has title
to any of the Owned Real Property, or (ii) any title exception is disclosed in
Schedule B to any Title Commitment that is not one of the Permitted
Encumbrances or not one that the Company specifies when delivering the Title
Commitment to Guaranty that the Company will cause to be deleted from the
Title Commitment concurrently with the Closing, including: (A) any exceptions
that pertain to Liens securing any loans; and (B) any exceptions that Guaranty
reasonably believes could materially and adversely affect Guarantys use of
the Owned Real Property described therein (a " **Title Objection** "),
Guaranty will notify the Company in writing of such matters within 15 Business
Days after receiving all of the Title Commitments for the Owned Real Property.
The Company may elect, but shall have no obligations, within fifteen Business
Days of receipt of the final Title Objection (" **Title Cure Period** ") to
remove or cure, or with Guarantys consent, which

 



      
 

 



 

consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to obtain title
insurance over, the title matter subject to such Title Objection. If the
Company does not elect or is unable to remove or cure or, with Guarantys
consent, to obtain insurance over all title matters subject to the Title
Objection within the Title Cure Period, Guaranty may by written notice given
to the Company (" **Election Notice** ") within ten days after the Title Cure
Period (" **Election Notice Period** "), or any other cure period indicated by
the Company, elect only one of the following options:

 



 

(i) waive all uncured and unremoved title matters for which Guaranty has
delivered a Title Objection;

 



 

(ii) terminate this Agreement with respect to such parcel of Owned Real
Property subject to the relevant Title Objection (the " **Owned Real Property
Subject to Title Termination** "), but not as to any other Owned Real Property
or any other matter in this Agreement, in which event this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect with respect to all other matters in this
Agreement (including all other Owned Real Property except the Owned Real
Property Subject to Title Termination), and this Agreement shall be deemed to
be modified as necessary to reflect the change in the Owned Real Property to
be acquired by Guaranty and Guaranty and the Company shall remove such Owned
Real Property Subject to Termination from the assets of the Company prior to
the Calculation Date; or

 



 

(iii) terminate this Agreement if such Owned Real Property Subject to Title
Termination is a Required Owned Real Property.

 



 

(c) If the Company does not receive an Election Notice within the Election
Notice Period, Guaranty shall be deemed to have accepted the status of title
to the Owned Real Property as shown in the initial Title Commitments and all
updates and supplements thereto as reflected in the applicable updated Title
Commitments, subject to the Permitted Exceptions (each Title Commitment after
expiration of the Election Notice Period shall be referred to as a " **Closing
Title Commitment** "), and thereby to have waived any unremoved or uncured
title matters for which Guaranty has delivered a Title Objection.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Confidentiality_. The Company will not, and will cause its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, before or after the
consummation or termination of this Agreement, disclose any confidential
information, whether written or oral (" **Subject Information** ") acquired
from, or made available by, Guaranty, Guaranty Bank or any of their respective
Representatives to any Person for any reason or purpose whatsoever, other than
in connection with the regulatory notice and application process or, after
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, use such Subject
Information for its own purposes or for the benefit of any Person under any
circumstances. The term "Subject Information" does not include any information
that: (a) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to
and known to the public, other than by a breach of this Agreement by the
Company; (b) was available to the Company on a nonconfidential basis from a
source other than Guaranty or Guaranty Bank; or (c) was independently acquired
or developed without violating any obligations of this Agreement.

**Registration Statement** ") and any other applicable documents, including
the notice, proxy statement, and prospectus and other proxy solicitation
materials of the Company and Guaranty constituting a part thereof (the "

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not false or misleading, and at the time of mailing thereof to the Companys
shareholders, at the time of the Company Meeting and at the time the
Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, the
Registration Statement, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading; provided, however, that none of the provisions of this
_Section 7.2_ shall apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration
Statement made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished
solely by the Company for use in the Registration Statement. Guaranty shall
make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities or "Blue Sky" laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder, and shall timely obtain any actions, consents
approvals or waivers required in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 7.3 _NASDAQ Listing_. Guaranty will file all documents required to be

this Agreement will, on the issuance to such shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
The shares of Guaranty Common Stock to be issued to the shareholders of the

will not be subject to any restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act,
except for shares of Guaranty Common Stock issued by Guaranty to any
shareholders of

 



      
 

 



 

the Company who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Guaranty under the
Exchange Act after completion of the Merger.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and for a period of six years after the Effective Time, Guaranty and
its successors and assigns shall indemnify and hold harmless each Person who
is now, or who has been at any time before the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes before the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or
its Subsidiaries and their respective heirs and assigns (collectively, "
**Indemnified Parties** ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that
are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written
consent of Guaranty) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative or investigation (each, a " **Claim** "), in
which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or
witness, arising out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such Claim pertains to
any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective
Time (including the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the Companys or Banks
Charter Documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement and Applicable
Law. Guaranty shall pay reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) in advance of the final disposition of any such proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the extent permissible under Applicable Law upon receipt
of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if he or she shall be
adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 7.5_. If after the Closing Date Guaranty or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
other Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Guaranty shall assume the obligations set forth
in this _Section 7.5_.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
7.5(a)_, upon learning of any Claim, shall promptly notify Guaranty thereof;
provided, however, that failure to so notify will not affect the obligations
of Guaranty under _Section 7.5(a)_ unless and to the extent that Guaranty is
actually prejudiced as a consequence. In the event of any such legal action
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) Guaranty shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof and Guaranty shall not be liable to
such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Guaranty elects not to assume such
defense, Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
Guaranty shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided,
however, that Guaranty shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section 7.5(b)_
to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction; (ii) Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any
such Claim; and (iii) Guaranty shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent; and provided, further, that Guaranty shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated under _Section 7.5(a)_ is prohibited by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Financing_. Guaranty will use its Best Efforts to put in place
financing arrangements on or before the Closing Date as necessary to provide
Guaranty with sufficient capital to enable it to complete the Merger and all
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall provide written evidence
of such financing to the Company in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.7 _Tax Structure_. Guaranty shall not take any action or omit to
take any action that could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Guaranty will give prompt
notice in writing to the Company of any fact, event or circumstance that (i)
is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts,
events and circumstances to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect
to Guaranty, (ii) would make untrue, in any material respect, any
representation or warranty made in, or information provided pursuant to, this
Agreement, or (iii) would cause or constitute a material breach of, or failure
to comply with, any of Guarantys representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually
or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Articles XI or XII.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Confidentiality_. Guaranty, and its subsidiaries, Affiliates and
Representatives, shall comply with all of their respective obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement dated September 21, 2015 between the parties
which is incorporated herein by reference (" **Confidentiality Agreement** ")
and which shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Tax Returns_. Guaranty will prepare and file all Tax Returns for
the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax Periods ending before the Closing
Date which are filed after the Closing Date; but such Tax Returns will be
subject to the review and comment by the Shareholders Representative. For
federal income tax purposes, Guarantys acquisition of the Company Stock
pursuant to the Merger will result in the termination of the Companys S
Election and an S termination year as such term is defined in Section
1362(e)(4) of the Code. For federal income tax purposes, the portion of 2016
from January 1, 2016 through the day before the Closing Date will be treated
as the Companys short S corporation taxable year (the " **Short S Corporation
Tax Period** "). Guaranty will pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation of all Tax Returns and Schedule K-1s to
former Company shareholders for the Short S Corporation Tax Period. Following
the Closing Date, the Shareholders Representative shall have all necessary
authority to review and approve on behalf of the Company and its shareholders
any amendments or modifications to the Companys Tax Returns for any Tax
Period, and to the extent requested by Guaranty, shall represent the Company
and its shareholders in connection with any audit or review by any
Governmental Authority of the Companys Tax Returns with respect to any Tax
Period ending before the Closing Date.

 



 

 **VIII.** **MUTUAL COVENANTS OF GUARANTY AND THE COMPANY**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Supplemental Schedules_. Following the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Guaranty will promptly
supplement or amend its disclosure schedules provided in connection with the
execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter that, if existing, occurring
or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set
forth or described in such disclosure schedules or that is necessary to
correct any information in such disclosure schedules that has been rendered
inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such disclosure schedules
shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_ (in the case of
Guaranty) or _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_ (in the case of the Company)
or otherwise affect the respective rights, obligations, representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Publicity_. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, the
rules of NASDAQ or in connection with the regulatory application process, as
long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Guaranty shall,
nor shall they permit any of their officers, directors or

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives to, issue or cause the publication of any press release,
written shareholder communications, or other public announcement with respect
to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the existence, terms,
conditions, status or transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The parties agree that they will make a good
faith effort to reach agreement expeditiously on such press releases,
shareholder communications, announcements or other public statements. To the
extent any term or provision of this _Section 8.2_ conflicts with any term or
provision in that certain Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and
Guaranty Bank dated September 21, 2015, the term or provision of this _Section
8.2_ shall control.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) To the extent reasonably requested by Guaranty, which request shall be
made to the Company at least 45 days before the Closing Date, the Company or
Bank, as appropriate, shall use its Best Efforts to execute and deliver such
instruments and take such other actions as Guaranty may reasonably request in
order to cause the amendment or termination of any Employee Plan (including as
set forth in _Section 3.3_), except for the KSOP which is governed by
_Section 8.7_, on terms reasonably satisfactory to Guaranty and in accordance
with Applicable Law and, except as may be otherwise provided herein, effective
no later than the Closing Date, and provided that the winding up of any such
plan may be completed following the Closing Date, provided further that the
Company or Bank has used its commercially reasonable efforts to complete the
winding up of any such plan prior to the Closing Date. Guaranty agrees that
the employees of the Company and Bank who continue their employment after the
Closing Date (the " **Company Employees** ") will be entitled to participate
as newly hired or continuing employees in the employee benefit plans and
programs maintained for employees of Guaranty and Guaranty Bank, including any
Employee Plan maintained in existence by Guaranty or Guaranty Bank following
the Closing Date, subject to the granting of credit for prior service as
provided below, in accordance with the respective terms of such plans and
programs, and Guaranty shall take all actions reasonably necessary or
appropriate to facilitate coverage of the Company Employees in such plans and
programs and the granting of such service credit from and after the Closing
Date, subject to _Section 8.3(b)_.

 



 

(b) To the extent that a Company Employee becomes eligible to participate in
an existing employee benefit plan maintained by Guaranty or Guaranty Bank (an
" **Existing Benefit Plan** "), Guaranty shall cause such Existing Benefit
Plan to recognize the prior duration of service of such Company Employee with
the Company for eligibility, participation and vesting under such Existing
Benefit Plan (other than vesting under any stock incentive plan) to the same
extent such duration of service was recognized immediately prior to the
Effective Time under a comparable Employee Plan in which such Company Employee
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided
that such recognition of prior service is permitted by the terms of the
applicable Existing Benefit Plan and Applicable Law and shall not operate to
duplicate any benefits of a Company Employee with respect to the same period
of service. With respect to any Existing Benefit Plan that is a health,
dental, vision plan or other welfare plan in which any Company Employee is
eligible to participate, for the plan year in which such Company Employee is
first eligible to participate, to the extent permitted by the applicable
Existing Benefit Plan and Applicable Law, Guaranty shall use its Best Efforts
to: (i) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting
periods under such Existing Benefit Plan to be waived with respect to such
Company Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the comparable Employee Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) recognize any
health, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Company Employee in the
year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such
Company Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such Existing Benefit Plan. Without limiting the foregoing,

 



      
 

 



 

Guaranty shall extend coverage to Company Employees for health care, dependent
care and limited purpose health care flexible spending accounts established
under Section 125 of the Code to the same extent as available to similarly
situated employees of Guaranty or its Subsidiaries to the extent permitted by
such Existing Benefit Plans and Applicable Law. Company Employees shall be
credited with amounts available for reimbursement equal to such amounts as
were credited under the Companys cafeteria plan to the extent permitted by
such Existing Benefit Plans and Applicable Law. For purposes of determining
Company Employees benefits for the calendar year in which the Merger occurs
under Guarantys vacation program, any vacation taken by a Company Employee
immediately preceding the Closing Date for the calendar year in which the
Merger occurs will be deducted from the total Guaranty vacation benefit
available to such Company Employee for such calendar year.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Regulatory Applications; Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Guaranty and the Company will use their Best
Efforts to (a) prepare and file as promptly as practicable with any
Governmental Authority or other third party all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents; and (b) obtain and maintain
all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, waivers, authorizations and
other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or other third party that
are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Guaranty Required Approvals and the Company
Required Approvals; provided, however, that the parties hereto understand and
agree that neither the Best Efforts of either party hereto nor any other
obligation of a party under this Agreement shall be deemed to include: (i)
entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or
agreement with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; (ii) except as required for disclosure in the
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or to obtain the Guaranty Required
Approvals, a party furnishing to the other party any: (A) personal
biographical or financial information of any of the directors, officers,
employees, managers, stockholders or partners of such party or any of their
respective Affiliates; or (B) proprietary and nonpublic information related to
the organizational terms of, or investors in a party or any of their
respective Affiliates; (iii) Guaranty or any of its Affiliates taking any
action that would result in the imposition of a Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition; (iv) the Company, Bank, Guaranty, Guaranty Bank or any
of their respective Affiliates commencing or being a plaintiff in any
litigation in connection with any registration, filing, application, notice,
approval, Order, qualification or waiver from a Governmental Authority
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (v)
except as required for disclosure in the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement, the Company furnishing to Guaranty any confidential information of
the Company and Bank related to the transaction sale process including,
without limitation, identities of potential purchasers, any offers previously
received, and any Company Board presentations, correspondence and minutes
relating to the Company sale process, other than as may be required to be
disclosed in the Registration Statement; or (vi) divesting or otherwise
holding separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise) any assets,
businesses or properties, or taking any other action (or otherwise agreeing to
do any of the foregoing) with respect to any of its or any of its Affiliates
businesses, assets or properties. Subject to the foregoing, Guaranty and the
Company agree that the Company and Guaranty, prior to the Closing Date, and
Guaranty, after the Closing Date, shall use their Best Efforts to execute and
deliver or cause to be executed and delivered such other documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as
may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement
expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require Guaranty or Guaranty Bank to (and neither
the Company nor Bank shall, without the prior written consent of Guaranty)
take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining any of the foregoing permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of third parties or Governmental
Authorities, that would: (1) reasonably be expected to be materially
burdensome on, or impair in any material respect the benefits of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Guaranty or the

 



      
 

 



 

Company; (2) require any Person other than Guaranty to guaranty, support or
maintain the capital of Guaranty Bank or Continuing Company, as applicable,
after the Closing Date; (3) require any modification of, or impose any
limitation or restriction on, the activities, governance, legal structure,
compensation, or fee arrangements of Guaranty Bank, Continuing Company or any
of their Affiliates (or any of their respective partners, members or equity
holders); (4) cause any Person other than Continuing Company to be deemed to
control Guaranty Bank or Bank after the Closing Date; or (5) require any
contribution of capital to the Company, Bank or Guaranty Bank at the Closing
(each of the foregoing, a " **Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition** ");
provided, however, that the following shall not be deemed to be included in
the preceding list and shall not be deemed a Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition: any restraint, limitation, term, requirement, provision or
condition that applies generally to bank holding companies and banks as
provided by statute, regulation, or written and publicly available supervisory
guidance of general applicability, in each case, as in effect on the date
hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither
the Company nor Bank shall make any payment without Guarantys prior written
consent (other than customary filing fees), take any action, make any
concession or agree to do any of the foregoing, in order to obtain the
consent, authorization or approval of any third party or Governmental
Authority.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Retention Agreements_. The Company shall use its Best Efforts to
cause (a) the Persons set forth on _Guaranty Schedule 8.5(a)_ to execute a
Retention and Non-Solicitation Agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B_ (" **Retention and Non-Solicitation Agreements** "),
and (b) the Persons set forth on _Guaranty Schedule 8.5(b)_ to execute a
Retention Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_
(" **Retention Agreements** "). Guaranty shall pay to specified Company
employees after the Closing the loyalty payments set forth on _Company
Schedule 8.5(c)_ which shall be accrued on the Companys books prior to the
Calculation Date.

 



 

Section 8.6 _S Corp Matters_. If the items set forth in _Company Schedule
4.32(k)_ have not been obtained by the Closing Date, at the Closing Guaranty
shall deposit in escrow the sum of $12,400,000, comprised of (a) cash of
$489,800 in immediately available funds, which cash shall be held in escrow as
a part of the KSOP Cash Consideration; and (b) 741,145 shares of Guaranty
Common Stock, which shares shall be held in escrow as a part of the Aggregate
Stock Consideration and shall be valued for this purpose at $16.07 per share
(such cash and stock, together with all earnings on the cash portion, the "
**Escrow Amount** "), with the Escrow Agent to be held and distributed in
accordance with _Company Schedule 4.32(k)_ and the Escrow Agreement to those
holders of Company Stock who surrendered their Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and otherwise complied with the process of perfecting their right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration or Per Share Transaction Value, as
applicable, pursuant to _Section 3.7_. Guaranty and the Company agree to
negotiate the terms of the Escrow Agreement in good faith and use their
respective Best Efforts to enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Escrow
Agent.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Termination of KSOP_. No later than two days before the Closing
Date, the Company shall provide Guaranty with a copy of a resolution or plan
amendment evidencing that the KSOP will be terminated effective as of no later
than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date; provided, however, that
the effectiveness of such termination may be conditioned on the consummation
of the Merger. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall submit IRS Form
5310 to the Internal Revenue Service seeking a determination ("
**Determination Letter** ") with respect to the KSOP and its termination. The
form and substance of such resolution or plan amendment terminating the KSOP
and the Form 5310 to be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service shall be
subject to the review and reasonable and timely approval by Guaranty. The
Company also may take such other actions in furtherance of terminating the
KSOP as it determines to be reasonably appropriate; provided, however, that
the effectiveness of any such actions may be conditioned on the consummation
of the Merger. On the Closing Date, Guaranty shall succeed the Company as
sponsor and administrator of the KSOP for purposes of overseeing the winding
up and termination of the KSOP. Until such time as Guaranty receives the
Determination Letter from the

 



      
 

 



 

Internal Revenue Service with respect to the KSOP, Guaranty shall cause KSOP
assets (including assets resulting from the receipt of the KSOP Cash
Consideration pursuant to the Merger) to be maintained in the KSOP and
invested in accordance with KSOP participant directions of investment of their
KSOP accounts. Prior to the receipt of the Determination Letter, Guaranty
shall designate a tax-qualified defined contribution plan of Guaranty or one
of its Affiliates (such plan, the " **Guaranty 401(k) Plan**") that either:
(i) provides for the receipt from the Company employees of "eligible rollover
distributions" excluding Guaranty Common Stock and the consideration received
in connection with exchange of the KSOP Shares or similar assets (as such term
is defined under Section 402 of the Code), including loans; or (ii) is amended
to provide for the receipt from the Company employees of such eligible
rollover distributions, including loans. Subject to Applicable Law, each
Company employee who is a participant in the KSOP shall be eligible to
commence participation in the Guaranty 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date and,
upon receipt of the Determination Letter from the Internal Revenue Service,
shall be given the opportunity to receive a distribution of his or her account
balance under the KSOP and elect to "roll over" such account balance
(including any outstanding loan) to the Guaranty 401(k) Plan.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Tail Policy_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
obtain an extended reporting period (otherwise known as "tail coverage")
policy with respect to all liability insurance policies of the Company and
Bank existing as of March 16, 2016 and for which tail insurance is available,
for a period of six years from the Effective Time, including a single-premium
prepaid "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policies covering
the period of six years from the Effective Time with respect to acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (a " **Tail Policy** ").
Subject to this _Section 8.8_, Continuing Company or Guaranty Bank shall pay
the premium for the Tail Policy, and the Tail Policy shall be effective as of
the Effective Time and shall provide for policy limits, terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage (including as coverage relates to
deductibles and exclusions) at least as favorable in the aggregate to the
directors and officers covered under such insurance policies as the policy
limits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage in the existing
policies of the Company and Bank; provided, however, in no event shall
Continuing Company or Guaranty Bank be required to expend in the aggregate for
such six year period more than 200% of the current amount expended on an
annual basis by the Company or Bank to maintain or procure such liability
insurance policies; provided, further, that if Continuing Company or Guaranty
Bank are unable to maintain or obtain the Tail Policy called for by this
_Section 8.8_, Continuing Company or Guaranty Bank shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available at a cost in the aggregate for such six
year period up to 200% of the current annual premium; provided, further, that
officers and directors of the Company and Bank may be required to make
application and provide customary representations and warranties to Continuing
Companys insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such Tail Policy. If,
after the Closing, Continuing Company or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Continuing Company shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 8.8_.

and such Order, decree, ruling or other action shall be final

 



      
 

 



 

and non-appealable unless such Order, decree or ruling or action restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger shall be due to the failure of
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) any approval, consent or waiver of any Governmental Authority required to
permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

material obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or has
resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such
applicable date.

accept.

this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(e)_ will not be

in full) at a rate per annum equal to 1% over the "prime rate" (as published

 **X.** **CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATION OF GUARANTY**

 



 

The obligation of Guaranty under this Agreement to consummate the Merger is
subject to the satisfaction, at or prior to the Effective Time of the

 _Exhibit B_

 

 ** **

 

 **RETENTION AND NONSOLICITATION AGREEMENT**

 



 

This RETENTION AND NONSOLICITATION AGREEMENT (this " **Agreement** ") is dated
as of [*], 2016, by and among Guaranty Bank and Trust Company, a Colorado
banking corporation (" **the Bank** "), solely for purposes of _Section
1(b)_, Guaranty Bancorp, a Delaware corporation and bank holding company
registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the " **Company** "),
and [*] (the " **Employee** ").

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company and Home State Bancorp (" **HSB** "), the sole
shareholder of Home State Bank (" **Home State Bank** "), have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of March 16, 2016 (the "
**Merger Agreement** ");

 



 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, HSB shall merge with
and into the Company, to be followed by a merger of Home State Bank with and
into the Bank;

 



 

WHEREAS, subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, the Employee and the Bank desire to enter into this
Agreement in connection with the grant to the Employee of a restricted stock
award and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which the
Employee hereby acknowledges; and

 



 

WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended to supersede any and all prior agreements,
arrangements and understandings between the Bank and the Employee relating to
the provision of services by the Employee to the Bank.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, the Employee and the Bank agree as follows:

 



 

1. **Effectiveness of Agreement; Grant of Restricted Stock**.

 



 

(a) _Effectiveness of Agreement._ This Agreement shall become effective upon
the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) if the Employee is
employed by Home State Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time. The date
on which the Effective Time occurs shall be the " **Effective Date** ". In the
event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement shall be null and void and shall have no force and effect.

 



 

(b) _Grant of Restricted Stock_. Within 30 days after the Effective Date, the
Company shall grant to the Employee a number of restricted shares of voting
common stock of the Company (" **Restricted Stock** ") equal to the quotient
of: (i) $[*]; and (ii) the closing trading price of the Companys voting
common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the last trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Date. The Restricted Stock shall vest in
three equal installments on the first, second and third anniversary of the
Effective Date, subject to the Employees continued employment with the Bank
and to such other terms and conditions as may be set forth in the award
agreement evidencing the grant of Restricted Stock.

 



 

2. **Confidentiality**.

 



 

(a) _Confidential Information_.

 



 

(i) The Employee agrees that he shall not at any time, except as required in
order to perform his services hereunder or with the prior written consent of
the Bank, or to the extent permitted pursuant to _Section 2(a)(ii)_, as
required by law, directly or indirectly: (A) use, disseminate, disclose or
publish, whether for his benefit or the benefit

      
 

 



 

of any person, firm, corporation or other entity, any Confidential
Information; or (B) deliver to any person, firm, corporation or other entity
any document, record, notebook, computer program or similar repository of or
containing any Confidential Information. " **Confidential Information** "
means: (1) confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets of or
relating to the Bank or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively,
the " **Bank Group** "), including, without limitation, intellectual property
in the form of patents, trademarks and copyrights and applications thereof,
ideas, inventions, works, discoveries, improvements, information, documents,
formulae, practices, processes, methods, developments, source code,
modifications, technology, techniques, data, programs, other know-how or
materials, in each case, that are confidential or proprietary and owned,
developed or possessed by any member of the Bank Group, whether in tangible or
intangible form; or (2) confidential or proprietary information with respect
to the Bank Groups operations, processes, products, inventions, business
practices, strategies, business plans, finances, principals, vendors,
suppliers, customers, potential customers, marketing methods, costs, prices,
contractual relationships, regulatory status, prospects and compensation paid
to employees or other terms of employment.

 



 

(ii) In the event that the Employee becomes legally compelled to disclose any
Confidential Information, the Employee shall provide the Bank with prompt
written notice so that the Bank may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained, the Employee shall furnish only that portion of such
Confidential Information or take only such action as is legally required by
binding order and shall exercise his reasonable efforts to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded any such Confidential
Information.

 



 

(b) _Confidentiality of Agreement_. The Employee agrees that, except to
enforce the terms of this Agreement or as may be required by applicable law or
legal process, during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, he shall not
disclose the terms of this Agreement to any person or entity other than the
Employees accountants, financial advisors, attorneys or spouse, _provided_
that such accountants, financial advisors, attorneys and spouse agree not to
disclose the terms of this Agreement to any other person or entity.

 



 

(c) _Exclusive Property_. The Employee confirms that all Confidential
Information is and shall remain the exclusive property of the Bank. All
business records, papers and documents and electronic files (including emails)
kept or made by the Employee relating to the business of the Bank shall be and
remain the property of the Bank. Upon the request and at the expense of the
Bank, the Employee shall promptly make all disclosures, execute all
instruments and papers and perform all acts reasonably necessary to vest and
confirm in the Bank, fully and completely, all rights created or contemplated
by this _Section 2_. The Employee further agrees that, upon termination of
the Employees employment with the Bank for any reason whatsoever, the
Employee shall return to the Bank immediately all memoranda, books, papers,
plans, information, letters and other data, and all copies thereof or
therefrom, in any way relating to the business of the Bank Group.

 



 

3. **Nonsolicitation**. The Employee agrees that, for a period of two years following the Employees Date of Termination, the Employee shall not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, either for himself or for or through any affiliate, individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity (without the prior written consent of the Bank): (a) Solicit any Client, supplier, licensee or other business relationship of any member of the Bank Group (or anyone who was a Client, supplier, licensee or other business relationship of any member of the Bank Group within the 12 months prior to the Date of Termination) to transact business with a Competitive Enterprise or to reduce or refrain from doing

 



      
 

 



 

business with any member of the Bank Group; (b) interfere with or damage any
relationship between any member of the Bank Group and a Client; or (c) Solicit
anyone who is then an employee of any member of the Bank Group (or who was an
employee of any member of the Bank Group within the 12 months prior to the
Date of Termination) to resign from any member of the Bank Group or to apply
for or accept employment with any other business or enterprise. For purposes
of this Agreement: (i) " **Date of Termination** " means: (A) if the
Employees employment is terminated by the Employee, the date specified in the
notice of termination, which shall not be less than 30 days after notice of
termination is given (unless the Bank selects an earlier Date of Termination);
or (B) if the Employees employment is terminated by the Bank, the date
specified in the notice of termination; (ii) " **Competitive Enterprise** "
means: (1) all banking and financial products and services that are
substantially similar to those offered by any member of the Bank Group or
other business in which any member of the Bank Group is engaged in on the Date
of Termination; (2) any enterprise engaged in any other type of business in
which any member of the Bank Group is also engaged, so long as the Employee is
or was involved in such other business on behalf of the Bank; or (3) any
enterprise that holds any equity, voting or profit participation interest in
any enterprise that engages in such a competitive activity; (iii) " **Client**
" means any client or prospective client of any member of the Bank Group; and
(iv) " **Solicit** " means any direct or indirect communication of any kind,
regardless of who initiates it, that in any way invites, induces, advises,
encourages or requests any person to take or refrain from taking any action.
The Employee shall not be deemed to violate this _Section 3_ solely by virtue
of having an interest in any entity the stock of which is publicly traded if
the Employee is the owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding shares of any
class of stock of such entity, provided that the Employee has no active
participation in the business of such entity (other than voting the Employees
stock) and the Employee does not provide services to such entity in any
capacity (whether as an employee, an independent contractor or consultant, a
board member, or otherwise). As used herein, the term "indirectly" shall
include, without limitation, the Employees permitting the use of the
Employees name by any Competitive Enterprise to Solicit, induce or interfere
with any employee, officer, representative, agent, customer, client supplier,
licensee or other business relationship of any member of the Bank Group.

 



 

4. **Nondisparagement**. The Employee agrees that at no time during the Employees employment with the Bank or thereafter shall he make, or cause or assist any other person or entity to make, any statement or other communication to any third party, reporter, author, producer or similar person or entity or to any general public media in any form (including, without limitation, books, articles or writings of any other kind, as well as film, videotape, audio tape, computer/internet format or any other medium) which impugns or attacks, or is otherwise critical of, the reputation, business or character of the Bank, any member of the Bank Group or any of their respective directors, officers, shareholders or employees.

 



 

5. **Remedies**.

 



 

(a) _Enforcement; Injunctive Relief_. The Employee acknowledges that he has
carefully read and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the restraints imposed upon him pursuant to _Sections 3_ and _4_.
The Employee agrees without reservation that each of the restraints contained
herein is necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the goodwill,
Confidential Information and other legitimate interests of the Bank; that each
and every one of those restraints is reasonable in every respect including,
but not limited to subject matter and length of time; and that these
restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent him from
obtaining other suitable employment during the period in which the Employee is
bound by these restraints. Without intending to limit the remedies available
to the Bank, the Employee agrees that a breach of any of the covenants
contained in _Section 3_ or _4_ may result in material and irreparable injury
to the Bank for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be
possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event
of such a breach or threat thereof, the Bank shall be entitled to seek a
temporary

 



      
 

 



 

restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both, without
bond or other security, restraining the Employee from engaging in activities
prohibited by the covenants contained in _Sections 3_ and _4_ or such other
relief as may be required specifically to enforce any of the covenants
contained in this Agreement. Such injunctive relief in any court shall be
available to the Bank in lieu of, or prior to or pending determination in, any
proceeding. The parties further agree that, in the event that any provision of
_Section 3_ or _4_ shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction
to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be deemed to be
modified to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law.

 



 

(b) _Extension of Restricted Period_. In addition to the other remedies the
Bank may seek and obtain hereunder, the two-year period contemplated by
_Section 3_ shall be extended by any and all periods during which the
Employee is in breach of _Section 3_.

 



 

6. **Notice of Termination**. Any purported termination of the Employees employment by the Bank or by the Employee, as the case may be, shall be communicated by written notice of termination to the other party hereto in accordance with _Section 7_. For purposes of this Agreement, a "notice of termination" shall mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Employees employment under the provision so indicated.

 



 

7. **Notice**. For purposes of this Agreement, all notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given the earlier of when delivered or five days after deposit in the United States mail, certified and return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

 _Exhibit C_

 **RETENTION AGREEMENT**

 



 

This RETENTION AGREEMENT (this " **Agreement** ") is dated as of [*], 2016, by
and between Guaranty Bank and Trust Company, a Colorado banking corporation
(the " **Bank** "), and [*] (the " **Employee** ").

 



 

WHEREAS, Guaranty Bancorp (the " **Company** "), the sole shareholder of the
Bank, and Home State Bancorp (" **HSB** "), the sole shareholder of Home State
Bank (" **Home State Bank** "), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of March 16, 2016 (the " **Merger Agreement** ");

 



 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, HSB shall merge with
and into the Company, to be followed by a merger of Home State Bank with and
into the Bank;

 



 

WHEREAS, subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, the Bank desires to pay to the employee a retention bonus
and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which the
Employee hereby acknowledges; and

 



 

WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended to supersede any and all prior agreements,
arrangements and understandings between the Bank and the Employee relating to
the provision of services by the Employee to the Bank.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, the Employee and the Bank agree as follows:

 



 

1. **Effectiveness**. This Agreement shall become effective at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) if the Employee is employed by Home State Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time. The date on which the Effective Time occurs shall be the " **Effective Date** ". In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement shall be null and void and shall have no force and effect.

 



 

2. **Retention Benefit**.

 



 

(a) The Bank shall pay the Employee a retention bonus (the " **Retention
Benefit** ") in an amount equal to $[*] upon the earlier to occur of the
following: (i) the Employees continuous employment with the Bank from the
Effective Date through the date that is [*] days after the Effective Date (the
" **Retention Period** "); or (ii) the involuntary termination of the
Employees employment with the Bank other than for Cause (as defined below)
during the Retention Period; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Retention Benefit
shall be payable to the Employee because of the reason described in _Section
2(a)(ii)_, the Employees right to receive the Retention Benefit shall be
subject to the Employees execution and non-revocation of a general release
prepared by and acceptable to the Bank in favor of the Bank.

 



 

(b) If, during the Retention Period, the Employee resigns from employment with
the Bank or is terminated by the Bank for Cause, the Employee shall forfeit
all of the Employees rights to be paid the Retention Benefit.

 



 

(c) The Retention Benefit shall be paid in a single lump sum cash payment,
less applicable withholdings and deductions within 30 days of the date that
triggers payments. The Retention Benefit shall not be considered in
calculating the Employees entitlement, if any, to vacation, sick leave,
bonus, incentive compensation, retirement, or other benefits; _provided_ ,
_however_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any
applicable severance benefit plan, to the extent the Retention Benefit is paid
to the Employee, such payment of the Retention Benefit shall be in lieu of any
payment or other benefit otherwise payable to the Employee under any such
applicable severance benefit plan and the

      
 

 



 

Employee shall thereafter not be entitled to any payment or other benefit
under any such applicable severance benefit plan.

 



 

(d) **Definition of "Cause"**. For purposes of this Agreement, " **Cause** "
means the Banks good faith determination of: (i) the Employees willful
failure or refusal to satisfactorily perform his duties or obligations in
connection with his employment; (ii) the Employees having engaged in willful
misconduct, gross negligence or a breach of fiduciary duty, or the Employees
material breach of this Agreement or of any Bank policy; (iii) the Employees
conviction of, or a plea of _nolo contendere_ to, a felony or any other
criminal offense involving moral turpitude, fraud or dishonesty; (iv) the
Employees unlawful use or possession of illegal drugs on the Banks premises
or while performing his duties and responsibilities hereunder; or (v) the
Employees commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement or misappropriation, in
each case, against the Bank or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates,
_provided_ that, in each case (except for circumstances described in clauses
(iii), (iv) or (v) above), the Bank shall provide the Employee with written
notice specifying the circumstances alleged to constitute Cause, and, if such
circumstances are susceptible to cure, the Employee shall have 30 days
following receipt of such notice to cure such circumstances.

 



 

3. **Confidentiality**.

 



 

(a) _Confidential Information_.

 



 

(i) The Employee agrees that he shall not at any time, except as required in
order to perform his services hereunder or with the prior written consent of
the Bank, or to the extent permitted pursuant to _Section 3(a)(ii)_, as
required by law, directly or indirectly: (A) use, disseminate, disclose or
publish, whether for his benefit or the benefit of any person, firm,
corporation or other entity, any Confidential Information; or (B) deliver to
any person, firm, corporation or other entity any document, record, notebook,
computer program or similar repository of or containing any Confidential
Information. " **Confidential Information** " means: (1) confidential or
proprietary information or trade secrets of or relating to the Bank or any of
its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, the " **Bank Group** "),
including, without limitation, intellectual property in the form of patents,
trademarks and copyrights and applications thereof, ideas, inventions, works,
discoveries, improvements, information, documents, formulae, practices,
processes, methods, developments, source code, modifications, technology,
techniques, data, programs, other know-how or materials, in each case, that
are confidential or proprietary and owned, developed or possessed by any
member of the Bank Group, whether in tangible or intangible form; or (2)
confidential or proprietary information with respect to the Bank Groups
operations, processes, products, inventions, business practices, strategies,
business plans, finances, principals, vendors, suppliers, customers, potential
customers, marketing methods, costs, prices, contractual relationships,
regulatory status, prospects and compensation paid to employees or other terms
of employment.

 



 

(ii) In the event that the Employee becomes legally compelled to disclose any
Confidential Information, the Employee shall provide the Bank with prompt
written notice so that the Bank may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained, the Employee shall furnish only that portion of such
Confidential Information or take only such action as is legally required by
binding order and shall exercise his reasonable efforts to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded any such Confidential
Information.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Confidentiality of Agreement_. The Employee agrees that, except to
enforce the terms of this Agreement or as may be required by applicable law or
legal process, during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, he shall not
disclose the terms of this Agreement to any person or entity other than the
Employees accountants, financial advisors, attorneys or spouse, _provided_
that such accountants, financial advisors, attorneys and spouse agree not to
disclose the terms of this Agreement to any other person or entity.

 



 

(c) _Exclusive Property_. The Employee confirms that all Confidential
Information is and shall remain the exclusive property of the Bank. All
business records, papers and documents and electronic files (including emails)
kept or made by the Employee relating to the business of the Bank shall be and
remain the property of the Bank. Upon the request and at the expense of the
Bank, the Employee shall promptly make all disclosures, execute all
instruments and papers and perform all acts reasonably necessary to vest and
confirm in the Bank, fully and completely, all rights created or contemplated
by this _Section 3_. The Employee further agrees that, upon termination of
the Employees employment with the Bank for any reason whatsoever, the
Employee shall return to the Bank immediately all memoranda, books, papers,
plans, information, letters and other data, and all copies thereof or
therefrom, in any way relating to the business of the Bank Group.

 



 

4. **Nonsolicitation**. The Employee agrees that, for a period of two years following the Employees Date of Termination, the Employee shall not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, either for himself or for or through any affiliate, individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity (without the prior written consent of the Bank): (a) Solicit any Client, supplier, licensee or other business relationship of any member of the Bank Group (or anyone who was a Client, supplier, licensee or other business relationship of any member of the Bank Group within the 12 months prior to the Date of Termination) to transact business with a Competitive Enterprise or to reduce or refrain from doing business with any member of the Bank Group; (b) interfere with or damage any relationship between any member of the Bank Group and a Client; or (c) Solicit anyone who is then an employee of any member of the Bank Group (or who was an employee of any member of the Bank Group within the 12 months prior to the Date of Termination) to resign from any member of the Bank Group or to apply for or accept employment with any other business or enterprise. For purposes of this Agreement: (i) " **Date of Termination** " means: (A) if the Employees employment is terminated by the Employee, the date specified in the notice of termination, which shall not be less than 30 days after notice of termination is given (unless the Bank selects an earlier Date of Termination); or (B) if the Employees employment is terminated by the Bank, the date specified in the notice of termination; (ii) " **Competitive Enterprise** " means: (1) all banking and financial products and services that are substantially similar to those offered by any member of the Bank Group or other business in which any member of the Bank Group is engaged in on the Date of Termination; (2) any enterprise engaged in any other type of business in which any member of the Bank Group is also engaged, so long as the Employee is or was involved in such other business on behalf of the Bank; or (3) any enterprise that holds any equity, voting or profit participation interest in any enterprise that engages in such a competitive activity; (iii) " **Client** " means any client or prospective client of any member of the Bank Group; and (iv) " **Solicit** " means any direct or indirect communication of any kind, regardless of who initiates it, that in any way invites, induces, advises, encourages or requests any person to take or refrain from taking any action. The Employee shall not be deemed to violate this _Section 3_ solely by virtue of having an interest in any entity the stock of which is publicly traded if the Employee is the owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding shares of any class of stock of such entity, provided that the Employee has no active participation in the business of such entity (other than voting the Employees stock) and the Employee does not provide services to such entity in any capacity (whether as an employee, an independent contractor or consultant, a board member, or otherwise). As used herein, the term "indirectly" shall include, without limitation, the Employees permitting the use of the Employees name by any Competitive Enterprise to Solicit, induce or interfere

 



      
 

 



 

with any employee, officer, representative, agent, customer, client supplier,
licensee or other business relationship of any member of the Bank Group.

 



 

5. **Nondisparagement**. The Employee agrees that at no time during the Employees employment with the Bank or thereafter shall he make, or cause or assist any other person or entity to make, any statement or other communication to any third party, reporter, author, producer or similar person or entity or to any general public media in any form (including, without limitation, books, articles or writings of any other kind, as well as film, videotape, audio tape, computer/internet format or any other medium) which impugns or attacks, or is otherwise critical of, the reputation, business or character of the Bank, any member of the Bank Group or any of their respective directors, officers, shareholders or employees. The Employee acknowledges and agrees that failure to comply with these requirements will render the Employee liable to the Bank for damages, including attorneys fees, and will excuse any obligation by the Bank to pay the Retention Benefit.

 



 

6. **Remedies**.

 



 

(a) _Enforcement; Injunctive Relief_. The Employee acknowledges that he has
carefully read and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the restraints imposed upon him pursuant to _Sections 4_ and _5_.
The Employee agrees without reservation that each of the restraints contained
herein is necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the goodwill,
Confidential Information and other legitimate interests of the Bank; that each
and every one of those restraints is reasonable in every respect including,
but not limited to subject matter and length of time; and that these
restraints, individually or in the aggregate, will not prevent him from
obtaining other suitable employment during the period in which the Employee is
bound by these restraints. Without intending to limit the remedies available
to the Bank, the Employee agrees that a breach of any of the covenants
contained in _Section 4_ or _5_ may result in material and irreparable injury
to the Bank for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be
possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event
of such a breach or threat thereof, the Bank shall be entitled to seek a
temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both,
without bond or other security, restraining the Employee from engaging in
activities prohibited by the covenants contained in _Sections 4_ and _5_ or
such other relief as may be required specifically to enforce any of the
covenants contained in this Agreement. Such injunctive relief in any court
shall be available to the Bank in lieu of, or prior to or pending
determination in, any proceeding. The parties further agree that, in the event
that any provision of _Section 4_ or _5_ shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision
shall be deemed to be modified to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent
permitted by law.

 



 

(a) _Extension of Restricted Period_. In addition to the other remedies the
Bank may seek and obtain hereunder, the two-year period contemplated by
_Section 4_ shall be extended by any and all periods during which the
Employee is in breach of _Section 4_.

 



 

7. **Successors and Assigns**. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Bank and the Employee, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.

 



 

8. **Notices**. For purposes of this Agreement, all notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given the earlier of when delivered or five days after deposit in the United States mail, certified and return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

10. **Failure to Enforce Not Waiver**. Any failure or delay on the part of either the Bank or the Employee to exercise any remedy or right under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver. The failure of either party to require performance of any of the terms, covenants, or provisions of this Agreement by the other party shall not constitute a waiver of any of the rights under the Agreement. No forbearance by either party to exercise any rights or privileges under this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver, but all rights and privileges shall continue in effect as if no forbearance had occurred. No covenant or condition of this Agreement may be waived except by the written consent of the waiving party.

11. **Severability**. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by any present or future rule of law or public policy: (a) such term or provision will be fully severable and this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision were not a part hereof; (b) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement; and (c) there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and still be legal, valid and enforceable. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision will be interpreted to be only as broad as is enforceable.

 



 

12. **Governing Law**. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado.

 



 

13. **No Guarantee of Employment; Other Agreements**. This Agreement does not constitute an agreement for employment. The Employee or the Bank may terminate the Employees employment at any time for any reason, or for no reason. This Agreement is not intended to, and does not alter the terms of any other agreement between the Bank and the Employee.

 



 

14. **Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed by either of the parties hereto in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

 



      
 

 



 

15. **Section 409A**. This Agreement is intended to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **Code** "), with respect to amounts subject thereto, and shall be interpreted and construed consistent with that intent. No expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, during any calendar year shall affect the amounts eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, to the extent subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and no such right to reimbursement or right to in-kind benefits shall be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. For purposes of Section 409A, each payment in a series of installment payments provided under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Bank may delay the payment of any amount or benefit under this Agreement that the Employee would otherwise be entitled to receive during the first six months following the date of the termination of the Employees employment, to the extent that the payment of such amount or benefit on the scheduled payment date would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

16. **Agreement to Terms**. By executing this Agreement, the Employee acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the Employee has read and considered the terms set forth herein, (b) the Employee understands and agrees to be bound by such terms of his own free will and accord, and (c) the Employee has been advised to consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement.
