Benefit Plans in which any Continued Employee is or will be eligible to
participate (with such eligibility determined taking into account such
service), other than for purposes of determining benefit accrual under
any Buyer Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit plan, provided that in no
event shall any such service be required to be recognized under a Buyer
Benefit Plan to the extent it will result in the duplication    25 
32  of benefits for the same period of service. From and after the Closing,

Plan in which such Continued Employee was a participant immediately prior to
his commencement of participation in such Buyer Benefit Plan; (y) waive any
waiting period or medical examination requirement applicable to any Continued
Employee under any such Buyer Benefit Plan to the extent satisfied under a

deductibles paid by such Continued Employee in the calendar year under an
Employee Benefit Plan and prior to the date such employee commences

applicable co-payments, out-of-pocket expenses and deductible requirements
under such Buyer Benefit Plan for the applicable calendar year.   Section

Indemnity Payment").   (b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless
from and against any and all Taxes resulting from any transaction involving
the Company that occurs after the Closing (including on the Closing Date)
that is not contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 8.02. Apportionment
of Taxes. (a) In order to appropriately apportion any Taxes relating to a
period that includes the Closing Date, the parties hereto will, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, elect with the relevant taxing authority to
treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period
of the Company (a "Short Period"), and such period shall be treated as a
Short Period and a period ending prior to or on the Closing Date for purposes
of this Agreement.   (b) In any case where applicable law does not permit
the Company to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a Short Period,
then, for purposes of this Agreement, the portion of each Tax that is
attributable to the operations of the Company for the period that would have
qualified as a Short Period if such election had been permitted by applicable
law (an "Interim Period") shall be (i) in the case of a Tax that is not based
on net income, the total amount of such Tax for the period in question
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Interim Period, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in
such period, and (ii) in the case of a Tax that is based on net income, the
Tax that would be due with respect to the Interim Period if such Interim
Period were a Short Period determined based upon an interim closing of the
books.    30  37   Section 8.03. Refunds and Tax Benefits. (a) Buyer
shall promptly pay to Seller an amount equal to any refund or credit
(including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) received by a
Tax Indemnitee (i) relating to taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date or (ii) attributable to Taxes that gave rise to a Tax Indemnity
Payment. Buyer shall, if requested by Seller (and at Seller\'s expense),
cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain any refund or credit that
would give rise to a payment under this Section 8.03(a). Buyer shall permit
Seller to control the prosecution of any such refund claim, and shall cause
the relevant entity to authorize by appropriate power of attorney such person
as Seller shall designate to represent such entity with respect to such
refund claim; provided that Seller shall not be entitled to prosecute any
refund claim that would be materially adverse to Buyer without Buyer\'s prior
written consent.   (b) Any amount otherwise payable by Seller under this
Article VIII shall be reduced by any Tax benefit that a Tax Indemnitee would
not have otherwise been entitled to but for the Tax or circumstances that
gave rise to Seller making a Tax Indemnity Payment. If a Tax benefit is
realized by a Tax Indemnitee after the payment of a Tax Indemnity Payment
then such Tax Indemnitee shall pay an amount to Seller equal to the Tax
benefit realized (including by way of a reduction in any estimated Tax
payments).   Section 8.04. Transfer Tax and Other Closing Expenses.
Buyer shall pay directly, or reimburse Seller promptly upon demand and
delivery of proof of payment for, all excise, sales, transfer, documentary,
filing, recordation and other similar taxes, levies, fees and charges, if any
(including all real estate transfer taxes and conveyance and recording fees,
if any), that may be imposed upon, or payable or collectible or incurred in
connection with, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. All
other expenses of Closing will be paid by the party incurring such
expense.   Section 8.05. Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Tax Claims will be governed exclusively by
this Article VIII.   Section 8.06. Contests. If any claim for Tax is
asserted in a Contest against any Tax Indemnitee that would result in the
indemnification of any such Tax Indemnitee by Seller pursuant to this Article
VIII, then the following provisions of this Section 8.06 will apply to the
handling of such claim. For purposes of this Agreement, "Contest" means any
audit, court proceeding or other dispute with respect to any Tax matter that
affects the Company. Unless Buyer has previously received written notice from
Seller of the existence of such Contest, Buyer shall give written notice to
Seller of the existence of any Contest relating to a Tax matter that is or
may be Seller\'s responsibility under this Article VIII within 10 days after
the receipt by Buyer of any written notice of such Contest. Each party shall,
at no cost to the other party, cooperate with the other party hereto and the
other party\'s representatives in a prompt and timely manner in connection
with any Contest. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to,
making available to the other party, during normal business hours, all books,
records, returns, documents, files, other information (including, without
limitation working papers and schedules), officers or employees (without
substantial interruption of employment) or other relevant information
necessary or useful in connection with any Contest requiring any such books,
records and files. Seller shall, at its election, have the right to represent
the interests of the Company in any Contest relating to a Tax matter for
which Seller may be required to make a Tax Indemnity    31 
38  Payment, to employ counsel of Seller\'s choice at the expense of Seller
and to control the conduct of such Contest, including settlement or other
disposition thereof; provided that any settlement that would be materially
adverse to Buyer requires Buyer\'s prior written consent.   Section 8.07.
Tax Returns. (a) Seller shall be responsible for filing (taking into account
any extensions received from the relevant Tax authorities) of all Tax Returns
required by Law (i) to be filed by (or on behalf of) the Company on or prior
to the Closing Date and (ii) which include the Company in a consolidated Tax
Return with Seller. Seller agrees that (i) such Tax Returns will accurately
set forth in all material respects, all items relating to the business
activities of the Company to the extent required to be reflected or included
in such Tax Returns by applicable federal, state, local or foreign Tax Laws,
regulations or rules and (ii) all Taxes shown to be payable on such Tax
Returns shall be paid or will be paid by Seller as and when required
by Law.   (b) Buyer shall be responsible for the timely filing (taking
into account any extensions received from the relevant Tax authorities) of
all Tax Returns required by Law to be filed by the Company after the Closing
Date other than consolidated Tax Returns which include both the Company and
Seller, it being understood that all Taxes indicated as due and payable on
such returns shall be the responsibility of Buyer except for such Taxes which
are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to this Article VIII which Seller
shall pay (as and when required by law). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared
on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a
different treatment of any item is required by an intervening change in
Law.   Section 8.08. After Closing. After the Closing, the parties shall,
and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, make available to the other
during normal business hours, as reasonably requested, and to any Tax
authority, all information, records and documents relating to the liability
or potential liability of the Company for Taxes for all periods prior to or
including the Closing Date and will preserve such information, records and
documents until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or
extensions thereof.   Section 8.09. Survival. All obligations under this
Article VIII shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue until 30 days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations on
assessment of the relevant Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall
not be responsible for any claim for indemnification unless Buyer shall have,
prior to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations, advised
Seller in writing of the facts that constitute or may give rise to an alleged
claim for indemnification under this Article VIII (such claim, a "Tax
Claim"), specifying in reasonable detail the basis under this Agreement for
such claim.   Section 8.10. Characterization as Purchase Price Adjustment.
All amounts paid pursuant to this Article VIII and Article IX by one party
to another party shall be treated by such parties as an adjustment of the
Purchase Price.   Section 8.11. Absence of Withholding Tax Liability.
Seller shall deliver to Buyer a certificate complying with the Code and
Treasury Regulations, in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer, certifying
that the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from withholding under
section 1445 of the Code.    32  39   Section 8.12. Section 338(h)(10)
Election. Seller and Buyer shall effect the timely filing of a completed Form
8023 and shall take such other steps, including those required by Form 8023
and Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1, as may be necessary to make
an effective election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code. Buyer and
Seller shall mutually prepare Form 8594 pursuant to Temporary Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1060-1T or shall take such other action required
pursuant to the Treasury Regulations under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code to
report the allocation of the Purchase Price (the "Purchase Price
Allocation"). Neither Seller nor Buyer shall, nor shall permit any of their
Affiliates to, file any Tax Return, or take any position with a
Tax authority, that is inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation.  
ARTICLE IX   INDEMNIFICATION   Section 9.01. Survival of Representations
and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the parties hereto
contained herein shall survive the Closing for a period of one year from the
Closing Date.   Section 9.02. Indemnification by Seller. Subject to
the provisions of Section 9.04, Seller agrees to indemnify each of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties against, and agrees to hold each of them harmless
from, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by them relating to or arising
out of or in connection with any of the following:   (a) any breach of or
any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Seller contained in
Article III made as of the date hereof or as though restated on and as of the
Closing Date (in each case without giving effect to any exception for
"Material Adverse Effect" or other qualifier using the term "material" or any
variation thereof in such representation or warranty); provided that in the
case of all representations and warranties a notice of the Purchaser
Indemnified Party\'s claim shall have been given to Seller not later than the
close of business within one year of the Closing Date; or   (b) any breach
of or failure by Seller to perform any agreement, covenant or obligation of
Seller contained in this Agreement or any document delivered by Seller to
Buyer at the Closing.   Section 9.03. Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to
the provisions of Section 9.04, Buyer agrees to indemnify each Seller
Indemnified Party against, and agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by them relating to or arising out of or
in connection with any of the following:   (a) any breach of or any
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Purchaser contained in
Article IV made as of the date hereof or as though restated on and as of the
Closing Date (in each case without giving effect to any exception for
"Material Adverse Effect" or other qualifier using the term "material" or any
variation thereof in such representation or warranty); provided that in the
case of all representations and warranties, a notice of the Seller
Indemnified Party\'s claim shall have been given to Buyer not later than the
close of business within one year of the Closing Date; or    33  40  
(b) any breach of or failure by Buyer to perform any agreement, covenant or
obligation of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered
by Buyer to Seller at the Closing.   Section 9.04. Limitations on
Indemnification. (a) Seller shall have no liability pursuant to Section
9.02(a) for any Losses incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds
US$2,000,000, after which time the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover only those Losses that exceed US$2,000,000, and in no
event shall Seller have any liability pursuant to Section 9.02(a) for any
Losses incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in excess
of US$46,200,000 in the aggregate; provided further that this Section 9.04(a)
shall not apply to any intentional or fraudulent breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty.   (b) Buyer shall have no liability
pursuant to Section 9.03(a) for any Losses incurred or suffered by the Seller
Indemnified Parties unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses
exceeds US$2,000,000, after which time the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to recover only those Losses that exceed US$2,000,000, and in no
event shall Buyer have any liability pursuant to Section 9.03(a) for any
Losses incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties in excess of
US$46,200,000 in the aggregate; provided further that this Section 9.04(b)
shall not apply to any intentional or fraudulent breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty.   (c) The amount of any Losses incurred or
suffered by any Indemnified Person shall be calculated after giving effect to
(i) any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Person or any of its
Affiliates with respect to such Losses and (ii) any recoveries obtained by
the Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates from any third Persons with
respect to such Losses; provided that the obligation of any Indemnifying
Person to make any payment to an Indemnified Person shall not be stayed or
delayed pending any determination as to whether an insurance carrier will
make any payment with respect to all or part of any Losses or whether the
Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates will recover from any third
Person with respect to all or part of any Losses. If any such proceeds or
recoveries are received by an Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates
with respect to any Losses after an Indemnifying Person has made a payment to
the Indemnified Person with respect thereto, the Indemnified Person or such
Affiliate shall pay to the Indemnifying Person the amount of such proceeds or
recoveries (up to the amount of the Indemnifying Person\'s payment).  
Section 9.05. Claims. As soon as is reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement not involving a
claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, of the
type described in Section 9.06, the Indemnified Person shall promptly give
notice to the Indemnifying Person of such claim and the amount (to the extent
then determinable) that, subject to Section 9.04, the Indemnified Person will
be entitled to receive hereunder from the Indemnifying Person; provided that
the failure of the Indemnified Person to give notice shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this Article IX except to
the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced
thereby.    34  41   Section 9.06. Notice of Third Party Claims;
Assumption of Defense. The Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly
as is reasonably practicable to the Indemnifying Person of the assertion of
any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, by any
Person not a party hereto in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
this Agreement; provided that the failure of the Indemnified Person to give
notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under
this Article IX except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person
shall have been prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Person may, at its own
expense, (a) participate in the defense of any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding and (b) upon notice to the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying
Person\'s delivering to the Indemnified Person a written agreement that the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02 or
9.03 for all Losses arising out of such claim, suit, action or proceeding and
that the Indemnifying Person shall be liable, subject to Section 9.04, for
the entire amount of any Loss, at any time during the course of any such
claim, suit, action or proceeding, assume control of the defense thereof;
provided that (i) the Indemnifying Person\'s counsel is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall
thereafter consult with the Indemnified Person upon the Indemnified Person\'s
reasonable request for such consultation from time to time with respect to
such claim, suit, action or proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person
assumes such defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not
the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Person.
If, however, the Indemnified Person reasonably determines in its judgment
that representation by the Indemnifying Person\'s counsel of both the
Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person would present such counsel
with a conflict of interest, then such Indemnified Person may employ separate
counsel to represent or defend it in any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding and the Indemnifying Person shall pay the reasonable fees and
disbursements of such separate counsel. Whether or not the Indemnifying
Person chooses to defend or prosecute any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof.   Section 9.07. Settlement. (a) Any settlement or
compromise made or caused to be made by the Indemnified Person or the
Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, of any claim, suit, action or
proceeding of the kind referred to in Section 9.06 shall also be binding upon
the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Person, as the case may be, in the
same manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise. If the
defense of such claim, suit, action or proceeding is not assumed by the
Indemnifying Person, the Indemnifying Person will not be subject to any
liability for any settlement or compromise made without its consent, but such
consent may not be unreasonably withheld; provided that it shall not be
unreasonable for an Indemnifying Person to withhold its consent to any
settlement or compromise involving the imposition of equitable remedies or
involving the imposition of any material obligations on the Indemnifying
Person other than monetary obligations for which the Indemnified Person will
be indemnified hereunder. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of
such claim, suit, action or proceeding, the Indemnifying Person shall have
the right to enter into a settlement or compromise of such claim, suit,
action or proceeding without the consent of the Indemnified Person; provided
that the Indemnifying Person shall be required to obtain such consent if the
settlement or compromise involves the imposition of equitable remedies
or involves the    35  42  imposition of any material obligations on
the Indemnified Person other than monetary obligations for which the
Indemnified Person will be indemnified hereunder.   (b) The Indemnified
Person shall give the Indemnifying Person at least 30 days\' notice of any
proposed settlement or compromise of any claim, suit, action or proceeding it
is defending, during which time the Indemnifying Person may reject such
proposed settlement or compromise; provided that from and after such
rejection, the Indemnifying Person shall be obligated to assume the defense
of and full and complete liability and responsibility for such claim, suit,
action or proceeding. Any and all Losses suffered by the Indemnified Party in
connection with such claim, suit, action or proceeding for which
the Indemnified Person is not otherwise entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the extent they
exceed the unindemnified Losses that would have been suffered by the
Indemnified Person under the proposed settlement that was so rejected.  
Section 9.08. Failure of Indemnifying Person to Act. In the event that the
Indemnifying Person does not elect to assume the defense of any claim, suit,
action or proceeding, then any failure of the Indemnified Person to defend or
to participate in the defense of any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding or to cause the same to be done, shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Person of its obligations hereunder.   Section 9.09. Net
Indemnity Payments. Any amounts payable under Article VIII and Section 9.02
or Section 9.03 shall be treated by Buyer and Seller as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.   Section 9.10. Exclusive Remedy. The provisions of this
Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties for any breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or any document
delivered at Closing; provided that this Section 9.10 shall not cover Tax
Claims to the extent covered by Article VIII.   ARTICLE X   NON-
SOLICITATION   Section 10.01. Non-Solicitation of Customers. Seller agrees
that from and after the date of this Agreement until one year after the
Closing Date (the "Non-Solicitation Period"), neither Seller nor any of its
U.S. Affiliates (other than the Company) will, directly or indirectly,
solicit any Person that is a customer of the Company at any time during the
period from thirty days prior to the date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date to become a retail brokerage customer of MaxBlue, Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown "Connect" or any retail brokerage service that is owned, operated or
promoted by Seller or any of its Affiliates; provided that the foregoing
shall not prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from (1) engaging in
general advertising or mass marketing activities (including through
television, radio, print media, direct mail, telephone contact, the internet
and any other electronic media) that are not targeted specifically to such
Persons, (2) soliciting any Person that is, at any time during the period
from thirty days prior to the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date,
a customer of Seller or any of its Affiliate (other than the Company), (3)
soliciting any Person who initiates contact with Seller or any of its   
36  43  Affiliates (other than in response to a solicitation otherwise
prohibited by this Section 10.01) or (4) soliciting any employee of Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) or any immediate family member
of any such employee. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its non-U.S. Affiliates to comply with the restrictions, subject to
corresponding limitations, set forth in this Section 10.01.   Section
10.02. Non-Solicitation of Continued Employees. Seller agrees that during the
Non-Solicitation Period, neither Seller nor any of its U.S. Affiliates (other
than the Company) will, directly or indirectly, solicit any Continued
Employee for employment or encourage any Continued Employee to leave his or
her employment with the Company or Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller
or any of its Affiliates from (1) engaging in any general solicitation for
employees, (2) hiring any Continued Employee who responds to any such general
solicitation who was not so solicited or encouraged or (3) soliciting or
hiring any Continued Employee whose employment has previously been terminated
by Buyer following the Closing Date (other than a termination resulting from
Seller\'s breach of this Section 10.02). Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its non-U.S. Affiliates to comply with the restrictions,
subject to corresponding limitations, set forth in this Section 10.02.  
Section 10.03. Limitation on Use of NDB Names. Seller agrees that during the
Non-Solicitation Period, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (other than
the Company) will, directly or indirectly, use any NDB Name in connection
with the ownership, operation or promotion of MaxBlue, Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown "Connect" or any retail brokerage service that is owned, operated
or promoted by Seller or any of its Affiliates; provided that the foregoing
shall not prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from using any NDB Name
in connection with the ownership, operation or promotion of (1) the Company
until the Closing Date or, with the prior consent of Buyer, the Company for a
period of 90 days after the Closing as is necessary for the transition of the
Company to Buyer and (2) the market-making activities and other wholesale
brokerage services of NDB Capital Markets, L. P. prior to and after the
Closing Date.   Section 10.04. Specific Performance. Seller recognizes
and affirms that in the event of breach by it of any of the provisions of
this Article X, money damages would be inadequate and Buyer would have no
adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Seller agrees that Buyer shall have the
right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to
enforce its rights and the Seller\'s obligations under this Article X not
only by an action or actions for damages, but also by an action or actions
for specific performance, injunction and/or other equitable relief in order
to enforce or prevent any violations (whether anticipatory, continuing or
future) of the provisions of this Article X. In the event of a breach or
violation by Seller of any of the provisions of this Article X, the running
of any such applicable restricted period (but not of Seller\'s obligations
under this Article X) shall be suspended with respect to Seller during the
continuance of any actual breach or violation. If a bond is required to be
posted in order for Buyer to secure an injunction, the parties agree that
such bond need not exceed the sum of US$1,000.   Section 10.05.
Severability. If at any time any of the provisions of this Article X shall be
determined to be invalid or unenforceable by reason of being vague or
unreasonable as to duration, area, scope of activity or otherwise, then this
Article X shall be    37  44  considered divisible (with the other
provisions to remain in full force and effect) and the invalid or
unenforceable provisions shall become and be deemed to be immediately amended
to include only such time, area, scope of activity and other restrictions as
shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or other
body having jurisdiction over the matter, and Seller expressly agrees that
this Agreement, as so amended, shall be valid and binding as though any
invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein.   ARTICLE

Registration.   (a) Filing. Subject to Section 2.1(c), the Issuer shall file
with the SEC within five (5) Business Days (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) after the Closing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) a Shelf
Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale of the Registrable
Securities by the holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the
methods of distribution elected by such holders and shall use its best
efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective
under the Securities Act as soon as possible thereafter.   (b) Continued
Effectiveness. Subject to Section 2.1(c), the Issuer shall use its best
efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in
order to permit the Prospectus forming a part thereof to be usable by the
holders during the term of this Agreement. The Issuer shall not be deemed to
have used its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement
effective if the Issuer voluntarily takes any action or omits to take any
action that would result in the inability of any holder of Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration     3  53 Statement to be able
to offer and sell any such Registrable Securities during the term of this
Agreement, unless such action or omission is required by applicable law.  
(c) Suspension of Registration. If the filing, initial effectiveness
or continued use of the Shelf Registration Statement at any time would
require the Issuer to make an Adverse Disclosure, the Issuer may, upon giving
prompt written notice of such action to the holders, delay the filing or
initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, the Shelf Registration
Statement; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be permitted to do so
(A) more than two times during any 12 (twelve) month period, (B) for a period
exceeding thirty (30) days on any one occasion or (C) for a period exceeding
sixty (60) days in any 12 (twelve) month period. In the event the Issuer
exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the holders agree to
suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice referred to above,
their use of the Prospectus relating to the Shelf Registration in connection
with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. The Issuer shall
immediately notify the holders upon the expiration of any period during which
it exercised its rights under this Section 2.1(c). The Issuer represents that
it has no knowledge of any current or anticipated circumstance that would
reasonably be expected to cause the Issuer to exercise its rights under this
Section 2.1(c).   (d) Underwritten Offering. If the holders of not less than
a majority of any class of Registrable Securities included in any offering
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement so elect, such offering shall be
in the form of an Underwritten Offering and the Issuer, if necessary, shall
amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement for such purpose. The
holders of a majority of the class of Registrable Securities included in such
Underwritten Offering shall, after consulting with the Issuer, have the right
to select the managing underwriter or underwriters for the offering who shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, it being understood that Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown or any affiliate thereof is acceptable to the Issuer.  
(e) Effect on Demand and Incidental Registration Obligation. The
provisions of Sections 2.2 and 2.3 shall not apply at any time the Issuer is
eligible to file and maintain the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration
Statement and is complying with its obligations under this Section 2.1 with
respect to all Registrable Securities.   2.2. Demand Registrations.   (a)
Demand by Holders. (i) At any time the holders of not less than 25% percent
of any class of the Registrable Securities may make a written request to the
Issuer for registration of (A) all of the Registrable Securities held by such
holders or (B) any part of the Registrable Securities held by such requesting
holders, provided that the estimated market value of the
Registrable Securities to be registered pursuant to this clause (B) is at
least $30 million in the aggregate. Any such requested registration shall
hereinafter be referred to as a "Demand Registration." Each request for a
Demand Registration shall specify the aggregate amount of Registrable
Securities to be registered and the intended methods of disposition
thereof.   (ii) Within ten (10) days following receipt of any request for a
Demand Registration, the Issuer shall deliver written notice of such request
to all other holders of Registrable Securities of the class or classes to
be registered. Thereafter, the Issuer shall include in such Demand
Registration any additional Registrable Securities of each such class which
the    4  54 holder or holders thereof have requested in writing be
included in such Demand Registration, provided that all requests therefor
have been received by the Issuer within ten (10) days of the Issuer\'s having
sent the applicable notice to such holder or holders. All such requests shall
specify the aggregate amount and class of Registrable Securities to be
registered and the intended method of distribution of the same. The Issuer
may not include in such registration additional securities of the class or
classes of the Registrable Securities to be registered hereunder, including
securities to be sold for the Issuer\'s own account or for the account of
Persons who are not holders of Registrable Securities, except for such
additional securities of the class or classes of the Registrable Securities
held by other Persons that, at the date of the Purchase Agreement, had an
existing contractual right to participate in such registration and that
validly request participation in such registration pursuant to such existing
right.   (iii) As promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within thirty
days) following receipt of a request for a Demand Registration, the Issuer
shall file a Registration Statement relating to such Demand Registration and
shall use its best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act.   (b) Limitation on Demand
Registrations. In no event shall the Issuer be required to effect more than
four (4) Demand Registrations.   (c) Demand Withdrawal. A holder may
withdraw its Registrable Securities from a Demand Registration at any time.
If all such holders do so, the Issuer shall cease all efforts to secure
registration and such registration nonetheless shall be deemed a Demand
Registration for purposes of Section 2.2(b) unless (i) the withdrawal is
based on the reasonable determination of the holders who requested such
registration that there has been, since the date of such request, a material
adverse change in the business or prospects of the Issuer or in general
market conditions or (ii) the holders who requested such registration shall
have paid or reimbursed the Issuer for all of the reasonable out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Issuer in connection with the
withdrawn registration.   (d) Effective Registration. The Issuer shall be
deemed to have effected a Demand Registration if the applicable Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC and remains effective for not less
than 180 days (or such shorter period as will terminate when all Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold or
withdrawn), or, if such Registration Statement relates to an Underwritten
Offering, such longer period not to exceed ninety (90) days after such
180(th) day as, in the opinion of counsel for the underwriter or
underwriters, is required by law for the delivery of a Prospectus in
connection with the sale of Registrable Securities by an underwriter
or dealer. No Demand Registration shall be deemed to have been effected if
an Underwritten Offering is contemplated by such Demand Registration and
the conditions to closing specified in the applicable underwriting agreement
are not satisfied by reason of a wrongful act, misrepresentation or breach of
such underwriting agreement or this Agreement by the Issuer.   (e)
Suspension of Registration. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued
use of a Registration Statement in respect of a Demand Registration at any
time would require the Issuer to make an Adverse Disclosure the Issuer
may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the holders, delay
the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, the such    
5  55  Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not
be permitted to do so (A) more than two (2) times during any 12 (twelve)
month period, (B) for a period exceeding thirty (30) days on any one occasion
or (C) for a period exceeding sixty (60) days in any 12 (twelve) month
period. In the event the Issuer exercises its rights under the preceding
sentence, the holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the
notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to the Demand
Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Securities. The Issuer shall immediately notify the holders of the expiration
of any period during which it exercised its rights under this Section
2.2(e).   (f) Underwritten Offering. If the holders of not less than a
majority of the Registrable Securities of any class which are included in any
offering pursuant to a Demand Registration so elect, such offering shall be
in the form of an Underwritten Offering. The holders of a majority of the
class of Registrable Securities included in such Underwritten Offering shall
have the right to select the managing underwriter or underwriters for the
offering, who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, it being
understood that Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown or any affiliate thereof is
acceptable to the Issuer, and subject to the right of the Issuer to select
one co-managing underwriter reasonably acceptable to such holders.   (g)
Priority of Securities Registered Pursuant to Demand Registrations. If the
managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering of a
class of Registrable Securities included in a Demand Registration (or, in
the case of a Demand Registration not being underwritten, the holders of a
majority of a class of Registrable Securities included in such Registration
Statement), inform the holders of such Registrable Securities in writing
that, in its or their opinion, the number of securities of such class
requested to be included in such Demand Registration exceeds the number which
can be sold in such offering without being likely to have a significant
adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the class of
securities offered or the market for the class of securities offered, the
number of Registrable Securities of such class that can be included without
having such an adverse effect shall be allocated pro rata among the holders
which have requested participation in the Demand Registration (based, for
each such holder, on the percentage derived by dividing (i) the number of
Registrable Securities of such class which such holder has requested to
include in such Demand Registration by (ii) the aggregate number
of Registrable Securities of such class which all such holders have requested
to include). To the extent that 25% or more of the Registrable Securities
requested to be registered are so excluded, the holders shall have the right
to one additional Demand Registration under this Section 2.2.   (h)
Registration Statement Form. Registrations under this Section 2.2 shall be on
such appropriate registration form of the SEC (i) as shall be selected by the
Issuer and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the holders of a majority
of each class of Registrable Securities requesting participation in the
Demand Registration and (ii) as shall permit the disposition of the
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of
disposition specified in the applicable holders\' requests for such
registration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, pursuant to a Demand
Registration, (x) the Issuer proposes to effect registration by filing a
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or any successor or similar short-form
registration statement), (y) such registration is in connection with an
Underwritten Offering and (z) the managing underwriter or underwriters shall
advise the Issuer in writing that, in its or their opinion, the use of
another form of registration statement (or the inclusion, rather than
the    6  56   incorporation by reference, of information in the
Prospectus related to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or other short-
form registration statement)) is of material importance to the success of
such proposed offering, then such registration shall be effected on such
other form (or such information shall be so included in such Prospectus).  
2.3. Incidental Registrations.   (a) Participation. (i) If the Issuer at any
time proposes to file a Registration Statement with respect to any offering
of its securities for its own account or for the account of any holders of
its securities (other than (A) a registration under Section 2.1 or 2.2
hereof, (B) a registration on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor form to such
forms, or (C) a registration of securities solely relating to an offering and
sale to employees or directors of the Issuer pursuant to any employee stock
plan or other employee benefit plan arrangement then, as soon as practicable
(but in no event less than ten (10) days prior to the proposed date of filing
such Registration Statement), the Issuer shall give written notice of such
proposed filing to all holders of Registrable Securities that are equity
securities (in the case that the Issuer registers equity securities,
including securities convertible into equity securities) or of Registrable
Securities that are debt securities (in the case that the Issuer register s
debt securities), and such notice shall offer the holders of such Registrable
Securities the opportunity to register such number of Registrable Securities
as each such holder may request in writing (an "Incidental Registration").
Subject to Section 2.3(b), the Issuer shall include in such Registration
Statement all such Registrable Securities which are requested to be included
therein within ten (10) days after the receipt by such holder of any such
notice. If at any time after giving written notice of its intention
to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the
Registration Statement filed in connection with such registration, the Issuer
shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration of
such securities, the Issuer may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to each holder of Registrable Securities and, (x) in the case
of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to
register any Registrable Securities in connection with such registration, and
(y) in the case of a determination to delay registering, shall be permitted
to delay registering any Registrable Securities for the same period as the
delay in registering such other securities.   (ii) If the offering pursuant
to an Incidental Registration is to be an Underwritten Offering, then each
holder making a request for its Registrable Securities to be included therein
must, and the Issuer shall make such arrangements with the underwriters so
that each such holder may, participate in such Underwritten Offering on the
same terms as the Issuer and other Persons selling securities in such
Underwritten Offering. If the offering pursuant to such registration is to be
on any other basis, then each holder making a request for an Incidental
Registration pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) must participate in such
offering on such basis.   (iii) Each holder of Registrable Securities shall
be permitted to withdraw all or part of such holder\'s Registrable Securities
from an Incidental Registration at any time; provided, that, except in the
case of a withdrawal pursuant to Section 2.6(b), the Issuer shall be entitled
to reimbursement from the holder of such withdrawn Registrable Securities for
any SEC registration fees incurred by the Issuer in connection with the
registration of such Registrable Securities.    7  57   (b) Priority of
Incidental Registration. If the managing underwriter or underwriters of any
proposed Underwritten Offering of a class of securities included in an
Incidental Registration (or in the case of an Incidental Registration not
being underwritten, the Issuer) informs the holders of Registrable Securities
of any class sought to be included in such registration in writing that, in
its or their opinion, the total amount or kind of securities which such
holders and any other Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the
number which can be sold in such offering without being likely to have a
significant adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the class
or classes of the securities offered or the market for the class or classes
of securities offered or the Issuer\'s common stock, then the securities of
each class to be included in such registration shall be allocated as
follows:   (i) first, 100% of the securities that the Issuer or (subject to
Section  2.7) any Person (other than a holder of Registrable Securities) 
exercising a contractual right to demand registration has proposed to  sell
shall be included therein;   (ii) second, the number of securities of such
class held by other Persons  that, at the date of the date of the Purchase
Agreement, had an  existing contractual right to participate in such
registration that  in the opinion of such underwriter or underwriters (or in
the case of  an Incidental Registration not being underwritten, the Issuer),
can  be sold without having such adverse effect shall be included
therein,   (iii) third, the number of Registrable Securities of such class
that in the  opinion of such underwriter or underwriters (or in the case of
an  Incidental Registration not being underwritten, the Issuer), can be 
sold without having such adverse effect shall be included therein,  with such
number to be allocated pro rata among the holders that have  requested
participation in the Incidental Registration (based, for  each such holder,
on the percentage derived by dividing (x) the  number of Registrable
Securities of such class that such holder has  requested to include in such
Incidental Registration by (y) the  aggregate number of Registrable
Securities of such class that all  such holders have requested to include);
and   (iv) fourth, and only if all of the Registrable Securities referenced
in  clauses (iii) have been included, any other securities eligible for 
inclusion in such registration shall be included therein.   2.4. Black-out
Periods   (a) Black-out Periods for Holders. In the event of a registration
by the Issuer (other than one during the effectiveness of a registration of
Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2.1), the holders of Registrable
Securities agree, if requested by the Issuer (or, in the case of an
Underwritten Offering, by the managing underwriter or underwriters), not to
effect any public sale or distribution (excluding any sale pursuant to Rule
144 under the Securities Act) of any securities (except, in each case, as
part of the applicable registration, if permitted) which securities are the
same as or similar to those being registered in connection with such   
8  58  registration, or which are convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for such securities, during the period beginning seven (7) days
before, and ending sixty (60) days (or such lesser period as may be permitted
by the Issuer or such managing underwriter or underwriters) after, the
effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such
registration, to the extent such holders are timely notified in writing by
the Issuer or the managing underwriter or underwriters.   (b) Black-out
Period for the Issuer and Others. (i) In the case of a registration of a
class of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2.2 involving the
offering and sale of equity securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for equity securities, the Issuer agrees, if requested by the
holders of a majority of such class of Registrable Securities to be
sold pursuant to such registration (or, in the case of an Underwritten
Offering, by the managing underwriter or underwriters in such Underwritten
Offering), not to effect (or register for sale) any public sale or
distribution of any securities which are the same as or similar to those
being registered, or which are convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for such securities, during the period beginning seven (7) days
before, and ending sixty (60) days (or such lesser period as may be permitted
by such holders or such underwriter or underwriters) after, the effective
date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such registration
(or, in the case of an Underwritten Offering under the Shelf Registration,
the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement in connection
therewith), to the extent the Issuer is timely notified in writing by a
holder of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement or
the managing underwriter or underwriters. The Issuer also agrees not to
effect (or register for sale) any public sale or distribution of
any securities prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
filed pursuant to Section 2.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may
effect a public sale or distribution of securities of the type described
above and during the periods described above if the same (A) is made pursuant
to registrations on Forms S-4 or S-8 or any successor form to such forms or
(B) as part of any registration of securities for offering and sale to
employees or directors of the Issuer pursuant to any employee stock plan or
other employee benefit plan arrangement.   (ii) The Issuer agrees to use
all reasonable efforts to obtain from each holder of restricted securities of
the Issuer which are the same as or similar to those being registered by the
Issuer, or which are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
of its securities, and which holder is a director or executive officer of the
Issuer or holds at least 2% of any class of such securities, an agreement not
to effect any public sale or distribution of such securities (other than
securities purchased in a public offering) during any period referred to in
this Section 2.4(b), except as part of any such registration if permitted.
Without limiting the foregoing (but subject to Section 2.7), if after the
date hereof the Issuer grants any Person (other than a holder of Registrable
Securities) any rights to demand or participate in a registration, the Issuer
agrees that the agreement with respect thereto shall include such Person\'s
agreement as contemplated by the previous sentence.   2.5. Registration
Procedures.   (a) In connection with the Issuer\'s registration obligations
in this Agreement, the Issuer will, subject to the limitations set forth
herein, use its best efforts to effect any such registration so as to permit
the sale of the applicable Registrable Securities in accordance with    
9  59  the intended method or methods of distribution thereof as
expeditiously as reasonably practicable, and in connection therewith the
Issuer will:   (i) before filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or
any amendments or supplements thereto and in connection therewith, furnish to
the underwriter or underwriters, if any, and to one representative of the
holders of each class of the Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement, copies of all documents prepared to be filed, which
documents will be subject to the review of such underwriters and such holders
and their respective counsel and, except in the case of a registration under
Section 2.3, not file any Registration Statement or Prospectus or amendments
or supplements thereto to which the holders of a majority of the class of
Registrable Securities covered by the same or the underwriter or
underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object;   (ii) prepare and file with
the SEC such amendments or supplements to the applicable Registration
Statement or Prospectus as may be (A) reasonably requested by any
participating holder (to the extent such request relates to information
relating to such holder), (B) necessary to keep such registration effective
for the period of time required by this Agreement or (C) reasonably requested
by the holders of a majority of any class of the participating Registrable
Securities;   (iii) notify the selling holders of Registrable Securities and
the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, and (if requested) confirm
such advice in writing, as soon as reasonably practicable after notice
thereof is received by the Issuer (A) when the applicable Registration
Statement or any amendment thereto has been filed or becomes effective and
when the applicable Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto has
been filed, (B) of any written comments by the SEC or any request by the SEC
or any other federal or state governmental authority for amendments or
supplements to such Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional
information, (C) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement or any order preventing or
suspending the use of any preliminary or final Prospectus or the initiation

any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus and
any preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary
to amend or supplement such Registration Statement or Prospectus in order to
comply with the Securities Act and, in either case as promptly as reasonably

and each managing underwriter, if any, without charge, as many copies of the

respective counsel reasonably requests in writing, and do any and all other
acts or things reasonably necessary or advisable to keep such registration or
qualification in effect so as to permit the commencement and continuance of
sales and dealings in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to

the underwriter or underwriters, if any, an opinion or opinions from counsel
for the Issuer dated the effective date of the Registration Statement or, in
the event of an Underwritten Offering, the date of the closing under the
underwriting agreement, in customary form, scope and substance, which counsel

each such class and underwriter or underwriters, if any, and their respective
counsel;   (xiv) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, obtain for

each inter-dealer quotation system on which any of the Issuer\'s securities
of such class are then quoted;   (xix) make available upon reasonable
notice at reasonable times and for reasonable periods for inspection by a
representative appointed by the holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities of each class covered by the applicable Registration Statement, by
any managing underwriter or underwriters participating in any disposition to
be effected pursuant to such Registration Statement and by any attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by such sellers or any such managing
underwriter, all pertinent financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents and properties of the Issuer, and cause all of the Issuer\'s
officers, directors    12  62  and employees and the independent public

agent in connection with such Registration Statement as shall be necessary to
enable them to exe rcise their due diligence responsibility (subject to the
entry by each party referred to in this clause (xix) into customary
confidentiality agreements in a form reasonably acceptable to the Issuer);
and   (xx) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, cause the senior
executive officers of the Issuer to participate in the customary "road show"
presentations that may be reasonably requested by the managing underwriter in
any such Underwritten Offering and otherwise to facilitate, cooperate with,
and participate in each proposed offering contemplated herein and customary
selling efforts related thereto.   (b) The Issuer may require each selling
holder of Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being
effected to furnish to the Issuer such information regarding the distribution
of such Securities and such other information relating to such holder and its
ownership of the applicable Registrable Securities as the Issuer may from
time to time reasonably request. Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees
to furnish such information to the Issuer and to cooperate with the Issuer as
necessary to enable the Issuer to comply with the provisions of this
Agreement. The Issuer shall have the right to exclude any holder that does
not comply with the preceding sentence from the applicable registration.  
(c) Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees by acquisition of
such Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from the Issuer
of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 2.5(a)(iv),
such holder will discontinue disposition of its Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Registration Statement until such holder\'s receipt of the
copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section
2.5(a)(iv), or until such holder is advised in writing by the Issuer that the
use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any
additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus and, if so directed by the Issuer, such holder will deliver to the
Issuer (at the Issuer\'s expense) all copies, other than permanent file
copies then in such holder\'s possession, of the Prospectus covering such
Registrable Securities which are current at the time of the receipt of such
notice. In the event that the Issuer shall give any such n otice in respect
of a Demand Registration, the period during which the applicable Registration
Statement is required to be maintained effective shall be extended by the
number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of
such notice to and including the date when each seller of Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement either receives the copies
of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 2.5(a)(iv)
or is advised in writing by the Issuer that the use of the Prospectus may be
resumed.   2.6. Underwritten Offerings.   (a) Underwriting Agreements. If
requested by the underwriters for any Underwritten Offering requested by
holders pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2, the Issuer and the holders of
Registrable Securities to be included therein shall enter into an
underwriting agreement with such underwriters, such agreement to be
reasonably satisfactory in substance and     13  63   form to the
Issuer, the holders of a majority of each class of the Registrable Securities
to be included in such Underwritten Offering and the underwriters, and to
contain such terms and conditions as are generally prevailing in agreements
of that type, including, without limitation, indemnities no less favorable to
the recipient thereof than those provided in Section 2.9. The holders of any
Registrable Securities to be included in any Underwritten Offering pursuant
to Section 2.3 shall enter into such an underwriting agreement at the request
of the Issuer. All of the representations and warranties by, and the other
agreements on the part of, the Issuer to and for the benefit of
such underwriters included in each such underwriting agreement shall also be
made to and for the benefit of such holders and that any or all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of such
holders. No holder shall be required in any such underwriting agreement to
make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the Issuer or
the underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements
regarding such holder, such holders\' Registrable Securities, such holder\'s
intended method of distribution and any other representations required by
law.   (b) Price and Underwriting Discounts. In the case of an
Underwritten Offering requested by holders pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2,
the price, underwriting discount and other financial terms for each class of
Registrable Securities of the related underwriting agreement shall be
determined by the holders of a majority of such class of Registrable
Securities included in the Underwritten Offering. In the case of any
Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 2.3, such price, discount and other
terms shall be determined by the Issuer, subject to the right of the holders
to withdraw their request to participate in the registration pursuant to
Section 2.3(a)(iii) after being advised of such price, discount and other
terms.   (c) Participation in Underwritten Offerings. No Person may
participate in an Underwritten Offering unless such Person (i) agrees to sell
such Person\'s securities on the basis provided in any underwriting
arrangements approved by the Persons entitled to approve such arrangements
and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the
terms of such underwriting arrangements.   2.7. No Inconsistent Agreements;
Additional Rights. The Issuer will not enter into, and is not currently a
party to, any agreement which is, or could be, inconsistent with the rights
granted to the holders of Registrable Securities by this Agreement or to any
agreement for the registration of securities that is, or could be, in the
aggregate more favorable to the holders of rights to securities thereunder
than to the holders of Registrable Securities under this Agreement.   2.8.
Registration Expenses. (a) The Issuer shall pay all of the expenses set forth
in this paragraph (a) in connection with a registration under this Agreement
of Registrable Securities. Such expenses are (i) all registration and filing
fees, and any other fees and expenses associated with filings required to be
made with the SEC or the NASD, (ii) all reasonable fees and expenses
of compliance with state securities or "Blue Sky" laws, including all fees
and disbursements of counsel in connection with any survey of state
securities or "Blue Sky" laws and the preparation of any memorandum thereon,
(iii) all printing, duplicating, word processing, messenger, telephone,
facsimile and delivery expenses (including expenses of printing certificates
for the Registrable Securities in a form eligible for deposit with The
Depository Trust     14  64  Company and of printing prospectuses),
(iv) all fees and disbursements of counsel for the Issuer and of all
independent certified public accountants of the Issuer, (v) Securities Act
liability insurance or similar insurance if the Issuer so desires, (vi) all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the Registrable
Securities on any securities exchange or the quotation of the Registrable
Securities on any inter-dealer quotation system and (vii) all applicable
rating agency fees with respect to any applicable Registrable Securities. In
addition, in all cases the Issuer shall pay its internal expenses (including,
without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees
performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any audit and the fees
and expenses of any Person, including special experts, retained by the
Issuer. In addition, the Issuer shall pay all reasonable fees and
disbursements of one law firm or other counsel selected by the holders of
a majority of the Registrable Securities being registered, provided,
however, that, to the extent such fees and disbursements exceed an amount of
$50,000 with respect to an individual registration, payment of the amount in
excess of $50,000 shall, in each such case, require the consent of the Issuer
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   (b) The Issuer shall
not be required to pay any other costs or expenses in the course of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including underwriting discounts and
commissions and transfer taxes attributable to the sale of Registrable
Securities and the fees and expenses of counsel to the underwriters other
than pursuant to clause (ii) of paragraph (a) above and the last sentence of
paragraph (a) above.   2.9. Indemnification.   (a) Indemnification by the
Issuer. The Issuer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent
permitted by law, each selling holder of Registrable Securities and their
respective officers, directors, advisors and agents and employees and each
Person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act) such Persons from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof, whether or not
such indemnified party is a party thereto) and expenses (including reasonable
costs of investigation and legal expenses), joint or several (each, a "Loss"
and collectively "Losses"), arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration
Statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the
Securities Act (including any final, preliminary or summary
Prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto
or any documents incorpor ated by reference therein) or (ii) any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading; provided, however, that the Issuer
shall not be liable to any indemnified party in any such case to the extent
that any such Loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such
Registration Statement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Issuer by such holder expressly for use in the
preparation thereof. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability
Issuer may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such holder or
any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of such securities by
such holder . The Issuer will also indemnify, if applicable and if requested,
underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers    15  65   and similar
securities industry professionals participating in any distribution pursuant
hereto, their officers and directors and each Person who controls
such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act)
to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of
the Indemnified Persons.   (b) Indemnification by the Holders. Each selling
holder of Registrable Securities agrees (severally and not jointly) to
indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, the Issuer,
its directors and officers and each Person who controls the Issuer (within
the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) from and against any
Losses resulting from any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission
of a material fact required to be stated in the Registration Statement under
which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act
(including any final, preliminary or summary Prospectus contained therein or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by
reference therein), or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case
of a Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made) not misleading, to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such untrue statement or omission had been con tained in any
information furnished in writing by such selling holder to the Issuer
specifically for inclusion in such Registration Statement. This indemnity
shall be in addition to any liability such holder may otherwise have. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any indemnified party. In
no event shall the liability of any selling holder of Registrable Securities
hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the
proceeds received by such holder under the sale of the Registrable Securities
giving rise to such indemnification obligation. The Issuer shall be entitled
to receive indemnities from, if applicable and if requested, underwriters,
selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry
professionals participating in the distribution, to the same extent as
provided above (with appropriate modification) with respect to information so
furnished in writing by such Persons specifically for inclus ion in any
Prospectus or Registration Statement. Each holder also shall indemnify any
underwriters of the Registrable Securities, their officers and directors and
each Person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the
indemnification of the Issuer.   (c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings.
Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt written
notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks
indemnification (provided, that any delay or failure to so notify the
indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations
hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is actually and materially
prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however, that any
Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select
and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
Person unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such
fees or expenses, (B) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the
defen se of such claim within a reasonable time after having received notice
of such claim from the Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and to
employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person, (C) in the
reasonable judgment of any such Person, based upon advice of its counsel, a
conflict of interest exists between such Person and the indemnifying party
with respect to such claims or     16  66  (D) the indemnified party
has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal
defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from
or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case,
if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person
elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party,
the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such
claim on behalf of such Person). If such defense is not assumed by the
indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made without its consent, but such consent
may not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that an indemnifying party may
withhold its consent to any settlement involving the imposition of equitable
remedies or involving the imposition of any material obligations on such
indemnifying party other than financial obligations for which such
indemnified party will be indem nified hereunder. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense, the indemnifying party shall have the right to settle
such action without the consent of the indemnified party; provided, that the
indemnifying party shall be required to obtain such consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld) if the settlement includes any admission
of wrongdoing on the part of the indemnified party or any restriction on the
indemnified party or its officers or directors. No indemnifying party shall
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to each indemnified party of an unconditional release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation. The indemnifying party or
parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings
in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements
and other charges of more than one separate firm (together with one fir m of
local counsel) at any one time from all such indemnified party or parties
unless (x) the employment of more than one counsel has been authorized in
writing by the indemnifying party or parties, (y) a conflict or potential
conflict exists or may exist (based on advice of counsel to an indemnified
party) between such indemnified party and the other indemnified parties or
(z) an indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of
counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or in addition to those available to the other indemnified parties, in
each of which cases the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels.   (d)
Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provided for in
the paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2.9 is unavailable to an
indemnified party or insufficient to hold it harmless as contemplated by
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2.9, then the indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result
of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on
the other. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and
the parties\' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.9(d) to the cont rary, no
indemnifying party (other than the Issuer) shall be required pursuant to this
Section 2.9(d) to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the
net proceeds received by such indemnifying party from the sale of Registrable
Securities in the offering to which the Losses of the indemnified parties
relate exceeds the amount of any damages which such indemnifying party has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement
or omission. The    17  67  parties hereto agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 2.9(d) were
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that
does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. If indemnification is available under this
Section 2.9, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party
to the full extent provided in Sections 2.9(a) and 2.9(b) hereof without
regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying parties or indemnified
party.   2.10. Rules 144 and 144A. The Issuer covenants that it will file
the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (or,
if the Issuer is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request
of any holder of Registrable Securities after the transfer date, make
publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales
pursuant to Rule 144 or 144A under the Securities Act), and it will take such
further action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder
to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 or 144A or
Regulation S under the Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended from time
to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.
Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Secu rities, the Issuer will
deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with
such requirements and, if not, the specifics thereof.   SECTION 3.
MISCELLANEOUS   3.1. Term. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier
of (i) the third anniversary of the date of this Agreement and (ii) the date
as of which (A) all of the Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to
a Registration Statement (but in no event prior to the applicable period
referred to in Section 4(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder) or
(B) the holders are permitted to sell their Registrable Securities under Rule
144(k) under the Securities Act (or any similar provision then in force
permitting the sale of restricted securities without limitation on the amount
of securities sold or the manner of sale). The provisions of Section 2.9 and
Section 2.10 shall survive any termination after consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.      18  68  
3.2. Injunctive Relief. It is hereby agreed and acknowledged that it will be
impossible to measure in money the damages that would be suffered if
the parties fail to comply with any of the obligations herein imposed on them
and that in the event of any such failure, an aggrieved Person will be
irreparably damaged and will not have an adequate remedy at law. Any such
Person shall, therefore, be entitled (in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled in law or in equity) to injunctive relief,
including, without limitation, specific performance, to enforce such
obligations, and if any action should be brought in equity to enforce any of
the provisions of this Agreement, none of the parties hereto shall raise the
defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.   3.3. Attorneys\' Fees.
In any action or proceeding brought to enforce any provision of this
Agreement or where any provision hereof is validly asserted as a defense, the
successful party shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys\' fees in addition to any
other available remedy.   3.4. Notices. All notices, other communications
or documents provided for or permitted to be given hereunder, shall be made

The registration rights of any holder under this Agreement with respect to
any Registrable Securities may be transferred and assigned, provided that no
such assignment shall be binding upon or obligate the Issuer to any such
assignee unless and until the Issuer shall have received notice of such
assignment as herein provided and a written agreement of the assignee to be

CLEARY, GOTTLIEB, STEEN and HAMILTON   [Letterhead of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen
and Hamilton]      [ ], 2001  Ameritrade Holding Corporation 4211 South
102(nd) Street Omaha, Nebraska 68127  Ladies and Gentlemen:   We have
acted as special counsel to National Discount Brokers Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Seller"), and National Discount Brokers Corporation, a New York
corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 30, 2001 (the "Purchase
Agreement"), between Seller and Ameritrade Holding Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Buyer"). This opinion letter is furnished pursuant to Section
6.01(h) of the Purchase Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Purchase Agreement.   In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have
reviewed the following documents:   (a) an executed copy of the Purchase
Agreement;   (b) an executed copy of the Registration Rights Agreement,
dated as of the  date hereof (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), between
Seller and  Buyer; and   (c) the documents delivered by Seller and the
Company at the Closing  pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.  In addition,
we have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to
our satisfaction of all such records of Seller and the Company and such other
instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers
and representatives of Seller and the Company and such    B-1 
74   Ameritrade Holding Corporation, p.2  other persons, and we have made
such investigations of law, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the
opinions expressed below.   In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we
have assumed the legal capacity of each individual signatory to a document,
the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all
documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, we have assumed and have
not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document we have
reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of each party contained in each of the Purchase Agreement and
the Registration Rights Agreement).   Based on the foregoing, and subject to
the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion
that:   1. Seller is validly existing as a corporation in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the Company is validly existing
as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of New
York.   2. The Company has the corporate power to own and lease its
properties and to conduct its business. Seller has the corporate power to
enter into the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and
to perform its obligations thereunder.   3. The execution, delivery and
performance of the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of Seller, and
each of the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Seller and is a valid, binding and enforceable
agreement of Seller (except that we express no opinion with respect to
provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement providing for indemnification
and contribution).   4. The sale of the Company Shares and the Company Notes
to Buyer pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the performance by Seller of
its obligations in the Purchase Agreement (a) do not require Seller or the
Company to obtain any consent, approval, authorization, registration or
qualification of, or filing with, any governmental authority of the United
States or the State of New York, except for such consents, approvals,
authorizations, registrations, qualifications and filings as have been
obtained or made prior to the date hereof, and except for filings that may be
required after the date hereof under the United States securities laws to
report the resultant ownership by Seller of the Buyer Shares (and we express
no opinion as to any consent, approval, authorization, registration,
qualification or filing that may be required under state securities or Blue
Sky laws), (b) do not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and
provisions of, or constitute a default under, the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-Laws of Seller or the Company, and (c) do not violate any
Law of the United States or the State of New York applicable to Seller or the
Company that is normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement (but we express no opinion as to any law, rule or
regulation under state securities or Blue Sky laws or the
antifraud provisions of United States securities laws).      B-2  
75  Ameritrade Holding Corporation, p.3    5. Assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties, and the compliance with the agreements,
of Buyer contained in the Purchase Agreement, no registration of the Company
Shares and the Company Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is
required for the sale of the Company Shares and the Company Notes to Buyer
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.   Insofar as the foregoing opinions
relate to the valid existence and good standing of Seller or the Company,
they are based solely on a certificate of good standing received from the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or the Secretary of State of the
State of New York, as applicable. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to
the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation
of Seller, (a) we have assumed that each other party to such agreement or
obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it
to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable
against it, and (b) such opinions are subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors\' rights generally and to
general principles of equity. We note that the designation in Section 11.04
of the Purchase Agreement and Section 3.6 of the Registration Rights
Agreement of New York as the venue for certain actions or proceedings
is subject to the power of the federal and state courts in such State to
transfer actions or to dismiss such actions on the ground that such court is
an inconvenient forum for such action or proceeding.   In rendering the
opinions expressed in numbered paragraph 4 above, we express no opinion as to
any consent, approval, authorization, registration, qualification or filing
required under, or any violation of, any Law which may be or become
applicable to the Company as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, Buyer\'s ownership of the Company
Shares or the Company Notes or its operation or intended operation of the
Company after the date hereof.   The foregoing opinions are limited to the
federal law of the United States of America, law of the State of New York and
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.   We are furnishing
this opinion letter to you solely for your benefit in connection with the
Purchase Agreement. This opinion letter is not to be used, circulated, quoted
or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.   Very truly yours,

EXHIBIT C   FORM OF LEGAL OPINION OF MAYER, BROWN and PLATT    [letterhead
of Mayer, Brown and Platt]     [ ], 2001  National Discount Brokers Group,
Inc. 10 Exchange Place Centre Jersey City, New Jersey 07302  Ladies and
Gentlemen:   We have acted as counsel to Ameritrade Holding Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), in connection with the acquisition by Buyer
from National Discount Brokers Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Seller"), of the shares of common stock of National Discount Brokers
Corporation, a New York corporation (the "Company"), and certain promissory
notes issued by the Company to Seller pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated
as of July 30, 2001 between Seller and Buyer (the "Agreement"). In connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement,
Buyer and Seller have also entered into the Registration Rights Agreement
dated as of the date hereof (the "Registration Agreement"). Capitalized terms
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Agreement.   In rendering the opinions expressed herein, we have examined
and relied upon such documents, corporate records, certificates of public
officials and certificates as to factual matters executed by officers of
Buyer as we have deemed necessary or appropriate. We have assumed the
authenticity, accuracy and completeness of all documents, records and
certificates submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the originals of
all documents, records and certificates submitted to us as copies and the
authenticity, accuracy and completeness of the originals of all documents,
records and certificates submitted to us as copies. We have also assumed the
legal capacity and genuineness of the signatures of persons signing all
documents in connection with which the opinions expressed herein are rendered
and the due authorization, execution and delivery of each of the documents
covered by the opinions expressed herein by each party thereto other than
Buyer.   Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set
forth below, we are of the opinion that:  1. Buyer is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware, with all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and     C-1  77 operate its properties and to carry on its business as
they are now owned, leased, operated and conducted.  2. Buyer has full
corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform the Agreement
and the Registration Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby.  3. The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer
of the Agreement and the Registration Agreement and the consummation by Buyer
of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly and validly approved
by Buyer\'s board of directors, and no other corporate actions or proceedings
on the part of Buyer are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of the Agreement, the Registration Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby. Buyer has duly and validly executed and
delivered the Agreement and the Registration Agreement. The Agreement and the
Registration Agreement constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of
Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with their respective terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws in effect that affect
the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and by equitable limitations
on the availability of specific remedies (except we express no opinion with
respect to provisions of the Registration Agreement providing for
indemnification and contribution).  4. No consent, authorization or approval
of, or filing or registration with, any Governmental Entity is necessary in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of the
Agreement and the Registration Agreement and the consummation by Buyer of the
transactions contemplated thereby, except those that have been obtained (and
we express no opinion with respect to the states securities laws or Blue Sky
laws).  5. The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of the Agreement
and the Registration Agreement and the consummation by Buyer of the
transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not (i), violate or
conflict with any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
Buyer or (ii) assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Seller set forth in Section 3.22 of the Agreement, violate any Law applicable
to or binding on Buyer that is normally applicable to transactions of the
type contemplated by the Agreement and the Registration Agreement (except we
express no opinion as to any state securities or Blue Sky law or the
antifraud provisions of the United States securities laws).  6. The shares
of Buyer Common Stock issued to Seller in connection with the Agreement are
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are free of any statutory
preemptive rights.     C-2  78   We are admitted to practice law in the
States of Illinois and New York and we express no opinions as to matters
under or involving any laws other than the laws of the States of Illinois and
New York, the federal laws of the United States of America and the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. With respect to any opinions
contained herein on matters governed by the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, you are aware that we are not admitted to the Bar of the
State of Delaware and that such opinions are based solely upon our
familiarity with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as
a result of our prior involvement in transactions of a nature similar to
those contemplated by the Agreement.   This opinion is furnished by us
pursuant to Section 6.02(k) of the Agreement, is solely for your benefit and
is not to be used, quoted or otherwise relied upon by any other Person, or
filed or furnished to any other Person or any Governmental Entity, without
our prior written consent.    Very truly yours,    MAYER, BROWN and
