Seller  Transaction Expenses to the extent not paid prior to the Closing Date
that are  due and payable on the Closing Date and (C) the aggregate Stock
Option  Adjustment Amounts (the "Preliminary Purchase Price"); provided,
however, one  and one-half percent (1.5%) of the sum of (x) the Preliminary
Purchase Price  plus (y) the aggregate Stock Option Adjustment Amounts
(together, the "Escrow  Amount") shall be delivered to an escrow agent (which
escrow agent shall be a  bank or trust company with a branch located in the
City of New York) appointed  prior to the Closing by the Stockholders
Representative, subject to approval  by the Purchaser, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed, pursuant to an Escrow Agreement
(the "Escrow Agreement") to be  entered into by the Purchaser, the
Stockholders Representative and the Escrow  Agent. Such Escrow Amount shall
be held and disbursed by the escrow agent in  accordance with the terms and
conditions in this Article II and in the Escrow  Agreement. Prior to the
Closing, the Stockholder Representative shall prepare  a schedule (based upon
the respective amounts payable to each Seller net of  any amount payable by
such Seller hereunder, but assuming that individually  and in the aggregate
each holder of Rollover Options held a like number of  Options that were not
Rollover Options in lieu of the Rollover Options so  held) setting forth the
respective percentages of the aggregate Escrow Amount  applicable to each
Seller, which schedule shall be utilized to determine any  distributions to
Sellers from the Escrow Amount or any other adjustments to  the Purchase
Price and corresponding payments to or by the Sellers (the "Pro  Rata
Amount").   (b) As used herein, the "Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount"  shall be the difference between the final Net Working Capital amount
as set  forth in the Final Statement minus the Target. In accordance with
Sections 2.7  and 2.8, the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be (1) increased
by the Net  Working Capital Adjustment Amount, if the Net Working Capital
Adjustment  Amount is a positive integral, or (2) decreased by the Net
Working Capital  Adjustment Amount, if the Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount is a negative  integral. The Preliminary Purchase Price as so adjusted
shall constitute the  "Purchase Price."   Section 2.3. Net Working Capital
As used herein, "Net Working Capital" shall be determined in the same manner
as the parties calculated the Target as of the close of business on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Schedule 2.3 sets forth the
calculation of Net Working Capital used by the parties to negotiate the
Target and all calculations of Net Working Capital pursuant to this Agreement
shall be made in the same manner as Schedule 2.3. Current assets shall only
be included in the calculation of Net Working Capital to the extent the MW
Companies continue to retain the benefit thereof immediately after closing
(it being understood and agreed that prepaid items directly related to the
officers\' and directors\' insurance will not be governed by this sentence).
Any current assets and current liabilities attributable to the  
-9-  incurrence of expenses directly related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any tax effect thereof (including, without
limitation, cancellation of the Options and payment of Funded Indebtedness)
shall not be considered in calculating Net Working Capital.   Section 2.4.
Payment of the Purchase Price.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, on the Closing  Date, the Purchaser shall pay, to such account or
accounts as specified by the  Company, in writing, on behalf of such intended

to (A) 0.985 multiplied by (B) the Per Share  Amount multiplied by (C) the
number of shares of Class A Common Stock owned  by such Class A Common
Stockholder as of the Closing less (D) all amounts  outstanding and payable
under any notes receivables of any MW Companies  (including the outstanding
principal balance and any accrued but unpaid  interest) owed by such Class A
Stockholder as of the Closing Date, if any  (the "Stockholder Loan
Amount");   (ii)to each Class D Stockholder an amount (rounded to the 
nearest whole cent) equal to (A) 0.985 multiplied by (B) the Per Share 
Amount multiplied by (C) the number of shares of Class D Common Stock owned 
by such Class D Common Stockholder as of the Closing;   (b) All payments
required pursuant to Section 2.4(a), Section 2.5  and Section 2.7 shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds  against delivery of, if
applicable: (i) stock certificates representing the  shares of Class A Common
Stock and Class D Common Stock being sold, in each  case in proper form as
reasonably requested by the Purchaser and (ii)  documentation reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser that all of the  outstanding Class B Warrants
and all of the outstanding Options shall be  cancelled prior to or at the
Closing.   (c) With respect to each payment made pursuant to Section
2.4(a),  Section 2.5 and Section 2.7, the Purchaser shall be entitled to, or
to cause  the appropriate MW Company to, deduct, withhold and remit to the
appropriate  Governmental Entities (or cause to be deducted, withheld and
remitted) any and  all Taxes required by Law with respect to such payment.
Any such withheld  amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been  paid to the party who otherwise would have received
such amounts but for such  withholding of Taxes.   Section 2.5. Payments of
Other Amounts Payable at Closing. On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
pay or cause to be paid to such account or accounts as the Stockholders
Representative specifies to the Purchaser in writing at least two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date:   (a) the aggregate amount of all Funded
Indebtedness as of  the Closing Date;    -10-   (b) the aggregate amount
of all Seller Transaction Expenses, to  the extent not paid prior to the
Closing Date that are due and payable on the  Closing Date;   (c) to each
Class B Warrantholder an amount (rounded to the  nearest whole cent) equal to
(i) 0.985 multiplied by (ii)(A) the Per Share  Amount minus (B) the Warrant
Exercise Price of such Class B Warrant multiplied  by (iii) the number of
shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion  of each such Class B
Warrant owned by such Class B Warrantholder as of the  Closing; and   (d)
to each Option Holder with respect to each outstanding Option  that is or
becomes as of the Closing vested (other than with respect to any  Rollover
Options) an amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to  (i)(A) 0.985
multiplied by (B)(1) the Per Share Amount minus (2) the Option  Exercise
Price of such Option, multiplied by (C) the number of shares of Class  A
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each such outstanding Option 
(other than any Rollover Options) owned by such Option Holder as of the 
Closing minus (ii)(A) 0.015 multiplied by (B)(1) the Per Share Amount minus 
(2) the Option Exercise Price of the Rollover Option multiplied by (C) the 
number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such 
Rollover Option owned by such Option Holder, if any.   Section 2.6. Closing

transactions provided for in this Article II (the "Closing") shall take place

Company and the Stockholders, such waiver may be made by the Company on
behalf of itself and each of the Stockholders) and (b) such other date, time
or place as the Purchaser and the Company (on behalf of itself and the
Stockholders) mutually agree; provided, however, notwithstanding anything

discretion, to postpone the Closing until after the expiration of the Company
Review Period. Subject to the foregoing, each of the parties will use its
commercially reasonably efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as soon as practicable. The date on which the Closing

2.7. Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.   (a) No later than 45 days
following the Closing Date, the  Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and shall deliver to the  Stockholders Representative a draft final
statement setting forth in  reasonable detail the Purchaser\'s calculation of
the final Purchase Price  which shall include a calculation of final Net
Working Capital amount, Net  Debt, Seller Transaction Expenses and the Net
Working Capital Adjustment  Amount (the "Draft Final Statement"). Seller
Transaction Expenses shall be  reconciled to the actual amount thereof. The
Draft Final Statement will be  accompanied by a report of the Company\'s
independent accountants stating that  the calculation of the final Net
Working Capital amount was prepared in the  same manner as Schedule
2.3.    -11-   (b) The Stockholders Representative shall have 45 days
following  the Purchaser\'s delivery or deemed delivery of the Draft Final
Statement to  the Stockholders Representative (the "Review Period") to review
and respond to  the Draft Final Statement, during which period the Purchaser
shall grant the  Stockholders Representative and its advisors (including
independent  accountants and legal counsel) reasonable access to all books
and records and  other materials used to prepare the Draft Final Statement
and any work papers  prepared by the Purchaser or (subject to execution of
customary exculpation  letters) its independent accountants with respect to
the Draft Final Statement  (collectively, the "Net Working Capital
Materials").   (c) In the event the Stockholders object to all or any part
of the  Draft Final Statement, the Stockholders Representative shall so
notify the  Purchaser in writing (such notice, a "Notice of Objections")
prior to the  expiration of the Review Period setting forth a description of
such objections  in reasonable detail and the amount of the adjustment which
the Stockholders  believe should be made to each item of their objection. If
the Stockholders  Representative fails to deliver a Notice of Objections
within the Review  Period, the Draft Final Statement shall be deemed to have
been accepted by the  Stockholders and shall become the Final Statement.  
(d) As soon as practicable but in no event later than 20 Business  Days
following the delivery by the Stockholders Representative of the Notice  of
Objections (the "Discussion Period"), the Purchaser and the Stockholders 
Representative shall meet and endeavor to resolve the matters set forth in
the  Notice of Objections. Any matters set forth in the Notice of Objection
that  are resolved by the Purchaser and the Stockholders Representative
shall  collectively be referred to herein as the "Resolved Objections." The
Draft  Final Statement shall be revised to reflect any Resolved Objections.
To the  extent the parties are able to resolve all matters set forth in the
Notice of  Objections, the Draft Final Statement as so adjusted by the
Resolved  Objections shall become the "Final Statement."   (e) In the event
the Purchaser and the Stockholders  Representative are unable to resolve all
matters set forth in the Notice of  Objections within such Discussion Period,
the following procedures shall  apply:   (i) After the end of the
Discussion Period, upon written  request of either the Purchaser or the
Stockholders Representative, the  parties shall jointly appoint the
Independent Expert to assist in the  resolution of the outstanding
objections;   (ii)Upon appointment of the Independent Expert, each party 
shall provide to the Independent Expert and to the other party, within five

the Notice of Objections and any other written submission or materials such 
party may wish to make, or provide, in support of its position, including 
the Net Working Capital Materials;   (iii) Each party may submit a reply
brief in response to the  written submissions referred to in clause (ii)
above, such reply brief to  be delivered to the Independent Expert and to the
other party within five  Business Days after the receipt of the other
party\'s written submissions;    -12-   (iv)The Independent Expert shall
review the matters set  forth in the Notice of Objections that are not
Resolved Objections (the  "Differences") and the written submissions, if any,
of the parties and  shall determine, based on the requirements set forth in
this Article II  (and related definitions), and only with respect to the
Differences  submitted, whether and to what extent the Draft Final Statement
requires  adjustment; provided, however, that in no event shall any
determination  made by the Independent Expert of any Differences result in an
adjustment  greater than the amount of the adjustment requested with respect
to such  Difference in the Notice of Objections. It is the understanding
and  agreement of the parties that time is of the essence in the resolution
of  the Differences, and each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to  cause the Independent Expert to make its determination as expeditiously
as  possible.   (v) The Independent Expert shall have the discretion to 
determine whether to convene a meeting or meetings of the parties to assist 
in the resolution of the Differences.   (vi)The fees and expenses of the
Independent Expert shall be  borne by the Purchaser and the Stockholders
Representative (on behalf of  the Sellers) in inverse proportion as each of
them may prevail on the  Differences resolved by the Independent Expert,
which proportionate  allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis
based on the relative  dollar values of the amounts in dispute.   (vii) The
Independent Expert\'s resolution of the Differences  shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties. The Draft Final  Statement, as adjusted to reflect
any such determination of by the  Independent Expert, shall become the Final
Statement.   Section 2.8. Final Purchase Price.   (a) In the event that
the Purchase Price as set forth in the Final  Statement exceeds the

Stockholders, the Option Holders and the Class B Warrantholders  their
respective Pro Rata Amount of such excess and (ii) the respective Pro  Rata
Amount of the Escrow Amount shall be released and disbursed by the escrow 
agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement to each of the 
Stockholders, the Option Holders and the Class B Warrantholders.   (b) In
the event that the Preliminary Purchase Price is greater  than the Purchase
price as set forth in the Final Statement, the escrow agent  shall disburse
from the Escrow Amount, in accordance with the terms of the  Escrow
Agreement: (i) to the Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of such  excess
and (ii) to each of the Stockholders, the Option Holders and the Class  B
Warrantholders their respective Pro Rata Amount of the balance remaining of 
the Escrow Amount, if any. If the amount payable to Purchaser in accordance 
with this Section 2.8(b) exceeds the Escrow Amount, the Sellers shall pay 
their respective Pro Rata Amount of the difference to the Purchaser, it
being  understood that the Escrow Amount is not a limitation on the amount
payable to  the Purchasers under this Section 2.8(b).   (c) If the Escrow
Amount exceeds the amount to which the Purchaser  may be entitled based on
the Draft Final Statement, then the escrow agent  shall be authorized
under    -13-   the Escrow Agreement to release and discharge such excess
amount as soon as  practicable after the date of the Draft Final Statement
and prior to the final  determination of the Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount.   (d) The amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be
paid  to the applicable recipient, whether disbursed by the escrow agent or
paid by  the Sellers or the Purchaser, within ten Business Days following the
date on  which the Draft Final Statement becomes the Final Statement.

MW Companies, either in connection with this transaction or  otherwise, which
payment would increase, be accelerated and/or would not be  deductible under
Code Sections 162(m) or 404.   (e) With respect to any Employee Plan, other

excluded from participation in  any Employee Plan. All liabilities or
expenses of the MW Companies in respect  of any Employee Plan (including

Environmental Matters.   (a) In the event that Environ, the Purchaser\'s
environmental  consultant (the "Purchaser Fayetteville Consultant"),
determines that the  costs of investigating and remediating one or more
Fayetteville Environmental  Conditions (the "Likely Fayetteville Costs") are
reasonably likely to exceed  $150,000 (the "Fayetteville Threshold"), the
Purchaser shall submit to the  Company a written opinion of the Purchaser
Fayetteville Consultant setting  forth such Likely Fayetteville Costs (the
"Purchaser Fayetteville Report") no  later than 10 Business Days after the
date hereof. Any fees and expenses of  the Purchaser Fayetteville Consultant
shall be for the account of and shall be  paid for by the Purchaser.   (b)
In the event that the Company receives a timely submission of  the Purchaser
Fayetteville Report, the Company shall have, for a period of 10  Business
Days    -43-   thereafter (the "Company Review Period"), the right to
review and respond to  the estimate of Likely Fayetteville Costs contained in
the Purchaser  Fayetteville Report. During the Company Review Period, the
Purchaser shall  grant to the Company and its advisors (including its
environmental consultants  and legal counsel) reasonable access to all
materials reviewed and used by the  Purchaser or the Purchaser Fayetteville
Consultant in preparing the Purchaser  Fayetteville Report. Prior to the end
of the Company Review Period, the  Company shall deliver to the Purchaser
either (i) its written agreement to the  Likely Fayetteville Costs set forth
in the Purchaser Fayetteville Report or  (ii) a separate written estimate of
the Likely Fayetteville Costs determined  by the Company\'s environmental
consultants (the "Company Fayetteville  Consultant") (such submission by the
Company, the "Company Fayetteville  Report"). Any fees and expenses of the
Company Fayetteville Consultant shall  be for the account of and shall be
paid for by the Sellers. In the event the  Company fails to deliver the
Company Fayetteville Report prior to the  expiration of the Company Review
Period, the Likely Fayetteville Costs set  forth in the Purchaser
Fayetteville Report shall be deemed to be the "Agreed  Fayetteville Costs"
for the purposes hereunder.   (c) In the event that the difference between
the Likely  Fayetteville Costs in the Purchaser Fayetteville Report and the
Likely  Fayetteville Costs in the Company Fayetteville Report is greater than
25% of  the larger of the two estimates (unless the difference is less than
$500,000  in which case the last sentence of this clause (c) shall apply),
the Purchaser  Fayetteville Consultant and the Company Fayetteville
Consultant shall jointly  select an environmental consultant of national
repute or otherwise reasonably  acceptable to Purchaser (the "Fayetteville
Independent Consultant") to make an  independent determination of the Likely
Fayetteville Costs. The fees and  expenses of the Fayetteville Independent
Consultant shall be shared equally  between the Purchaser and the Sellers.
The parties shall grant to the  Fayetteville Independent Consultant
reasonable access to all materials  reviewed and used by each of their
consultants in preparing such estimates of  the Likely Fayetteville Costs. It
is the understanding and agreement of the  parties that time is of the
essence and each party shall use its reasonable  best efforts to cause the
Fayetteville Independent Consultant to make its  determination as
expeditiously as possible but in any event not later than 60  days from the
date hereof. The average of the estimated Likely Fayetteville  Costs as
determined by the Purchaser Fayetteville Consultant, the Company 
Fayetteville Consultant and the Fayetteville Independent Consultant shall 
constitute the Agreed Fayetteville Costs for purposes hereunder. In the
event  that the difference in the Likely Fayetteville Costs as set forth in
the  Purchaser Fayetteville Report and the Company Fayetteville Report is
less than  25% of the larger of the two estimates, the average of the two
estimates shall  be deemed to be the Agreed Fayetteville Costs for purposes
hereunder.   (d) In the event that the Agreed Fayetteville Costs are less
than  the Fayetteville Threshold, the provisions of this Section 10.1(a),
(b), (c)  and e(iii) shall immediately terminate and shall have no further
force or  effect.   (e) From and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
indemnify  the Purchaser, the MW Companies and their respective Affiliates
(each an  "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties")
against and  hold harmless from (i) the first $250,000 of Hammonton ISRA
Damages; (ii)  seventy-five percent of Hammonton ISRA Damages in excess of
those referred to  in clause (i) above; and (iii) seventy-five percent of
any    -44-   Fayetteville Damages in excess of the Fayetteville
Threshold; provided,  however, (x) the aggregate liability of the Sellers
pursuant to clause (ii)  and (iii) above for any Damages suffered by the
Indemnified Parties shall in  no event exceed $5,500,000, and (y) the
Indemnified Parties shall carry out  any investigation and remediation
activities with respect to the foregoing  matters in the most cost-effective
manner that complies with any applicable  Environmental Laws and does not
interfere with operations at the Fayetteville  Facility or Hammonton Facility
as they were conducted on the Closing Date.   (f) The Indemnified Parties,
the Stockholder\'s Representative and  the Company will cooperate with one
another as reasonably appropriate with  respect to spending plans, budgets,
periodic historical spending results and  other pertinent information
regarding the status of any remediation or other  activities conducted in
connection with the matters covered by this Section  10.1. Purchaser agrees
the Company following the Closing shall be responsible  for that portion of
the Hammonton ISRA Damages and the Fayetteville Damages  not covered by the
contribution levels required by Section 10.1(e)(ii) and  (iii).   (g) All
obligations of the Sellers pursuant to Sections 10.1 and  10.2 hereof shall
be (i) several and not joint, (ii) in proportion with each  of their Pro Rata
Amounts and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in this Article X
or otherwise, in no event shall a Class B Warrantholder\'s  liability in
respect of any Damages owed pursuant to Sections 10.1 or 10.2  exceed
(together with all related liabilities and amounts paid in respect of 
Section 10.19 herein or any other section of this Agreement and whether in 
their capacity as Class B Warrantholders or Stockholders) the lesser of (A) 
such Class B Warrantholder\'s Pro Rata Amount, in respect of its Shares and 
Class B Warrants, of any such Damages and (B) the proceeds actually received 
by such Class B Warrantholder in respect of its Shares and Class B Warrants 
pursuant to this Agreement (except that such Class B Warrantholder shall be 
liable up to the amount set forth in clause (A) for any Damages attributable 
to any breach of representation by that Class B Warrantholder or in any 
Warrant cancellation agreement entered into by such Class B
Warrantholder).   (h)   (i) As soon as practicable after the Company has
determined that there are reasonably likely to be Hammonton ISRA Damages in
excess of $250,000, the Company will promptly notify the Purchaser and the
Company will, within 10 Business Days thereafter, submit to the Purchaser a
written report of an independent environmental consultant chosen by the
Company ("Company NJ Consultant") setting forth such consultant\'s estimate
of the likely amount (the "Likely NJ Costs") of Hammonton ISRA Damages (the
"Company NJ Report"). Any fees and expenses of the Company NJ Consultant
shall be paid for by the Sellers.   (ii) In the event that the Purchaser
receives a timely submission of the Company NJ Report, the Purchaser shall
have, for a period of 10 Business Days thereafter (the "Purchaser Review
Period"), the right to review and respond to the estimate of Likely NJ Costs
contained in the Company NJ Report. During the Purchaser Review Period, the
Company shall grant to the Purchaser and its advisors (including its
environmental consultants and legal counsel) reasonable access to all
materials reviewed and used by the Company or the Company NJ Consultant in
preparing the Company NJ Report. Prior to the end of the Purchaser
Review    -45-  Period, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Company either
(i) its written agreement to the Likely NJ Costs set forth in the Company NJ
Report or (ii) a separate written estimate of the Likely NJ Costs determined
by the Purchaser\'s environmental consultants (the "Purchaser NJ Consultant")
(such submission by the Purchaser, the "Purchaser NJ Report"). Any fees and
expenses of the Purchaser NJ Consultant shall be for the account of and shall
be paid for by the Purchaser. In the event the Purchaser fails to deliver the
Purchaser NJ Report prior to the expiration of the Purchaser Review Period,
the Likely NJ Costs set forth in the Company NJ Report shall be deemed to be
the "Agreed NJ Costs" for the purposes hereunder.   (iii) In the event that
the difference between the Likely NJ Costs in the Company NJ Report and the
Likely NJ Costs in the Purchaser NJ Report is greater than 25% of the larger
of the two estimates (unless the difference is less than $500,000 in which
case the last sentence of this clause (h)(iii) shall apply), the Company NJ
Consultant and the Purchaser NJ Consultant shall jointly select an
environmental consultant of national repute or otherwise reasonably
acceptable to Company (the "NJ Independent Consultant") to make
an independent determination of the Likely NJ Costs. The fees and expenses of
the NJ Independent Consultant shall be shared equally between the Company and
the Sellers. The parties shall grant to the NJ Independent Consultant
reasonable access to all materials reviewed and used by each of their
consultants in preparing such estimates of the Likely NJ Costs. It is the
understanding and agreement of the parties that time is of the essence and
each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the NJ Independent
Consultant to make its determination as expeditiously as possible. The
average of the estimated Likely NJ Costs as determined by the Company NJ
Consultant, the Purchaser NJ Consultant and the NJ Independent Consultant
shall constitute the Agreed NJ Costs for purposes hereunder. In the event
that the difference in the Likely NJ Costs as set forth in the Company NJ
Report and the Purchaser NJ Report is less than 25% of the larger of the two
estimates, the average of the two estimates shall be deemed to be the Agreed
NJ Costs for purposes hereunder.   Section 10.2. General Indemnification
.   (a) The Sellers shall indemnify, defend, save and keep harmless  the
Indemnified Parties against and from all Damages sustained or incurred by 
any of them resulting from or arising out of or by virtue of:   (i) an
inaccuracy in or a breach by any Seller of the  representations and
warranties of such Seller set forth in Section 4.1  (Authority and Related
Matters); and   (ii) an inaccuracy in or breach by the Company of the 
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.2 (Corporate 
Authority), 3.4 (Capital Stock) or 3.5 (Subsidiary).   (b) The Sellers shall
not be liable under this Section 10.2 unless  a claim has been asserted by
written notice, setting forth the basis for such  claim, delivered to the
Stockholders Representative with respect to a claim  for indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.2 hereof, prior to ninety (90) days  following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (excluding  extensions
thereunder, whether automatic or permissive).    -46-   Section 10.3.
Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may be amended only by a written
agreement signed by the Purchaser, the Stockholders and the Company at any
time prior to the Closing Date with respect to any of the terms contained
herein.   Section 10.4. Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
respective representations and warranties of the Purchaser, the Stockholders
and the Company contained in Articles III, IV and V of this Agreement shall
terminate at, and not survive, the Closing other than the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.2 (Corporate Authority), 3.4 (Capital
Stock), 3.5 (Subsidiary) and 4.1(a) and (b) (Authority and Related Matters)
which shall survive such date and consummation as set forth above in Section
10.2.   Section 10.5. Partial Invalidity. Wherever possible, each provision
hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but in the case that any provision contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had never
been contained herein unless the deletion of such provision or provisions
would result in such a material change as to cause completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby to be unreasonable.   Section 10.6.
Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
and delivered to each of the Company and the Purchaser.   Section 10.7.
Assignment; Successors and Assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties except
that the Purchaser may, without the obligation to obtain the prior written
consent of any other party, assign this Agreement or all or any part of its
rights or obligations hereunder to one (1) or more direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiaries of the Purchaser and may assign its rights under
this Agreement to its lenders for collateral security purposes (in all or any
of which cases the Purchaser shall remain responsible for the performance of
all of its obligations under this Agreement). In addition, without the
obligation to obtain the prior written consent of any other party, following
the Closing the Purchaser may assign its rights and delegate its duties under
this Agreement to any successor (by operation of law or otherwise), or any
purchaser of a majority of its or the Company\'s equity interest or
substantially all of its assets. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors or permitted assigns, heirs, legatees,
distributees, executors, administrators and guardians.   Section 10.8.

and Schedules shall refer to the Articles, Sections, Exhibits and
Schedules, respectively, of this Agreement.    -47-   Section 10.9.
Schedules and Exhibits. The schedules and exhibits referred to in this
Agreement shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement
to the same extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Except
as expressly set forth herein, disclosure of any fact or item in any schedule
hereto shall, to the extent reasonably apparent by cross-reference from the
face of such schedule and relevant to any other schedule or schedules,
be deemed to be disclosed in such other schedule or schedules,
notwithstanding the lack of a specific cross-reference.   Section 10.10.
Knowledge. In each provision of this Agreement in which a representation or
warranty is qualified to the "knowledge" of a Person or to the "best of the
knowledge" of a person, unless otherwise stated in such provision, each such
phrase means that the Person does not have actual knowledge after
due investigation thereof of any state of facts which is different from the
facts described in the warranty or representation. With respect to the
Company, such knowledge shall refer solely to the "knowledge" of one or more
of the Persons identified in Schedule 10.10.   Section 10.11. Waivers. Any
term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the time for its
performance may be extended, by the party or parties entitled to the benefit
thereof, in each case in writing. The failure of any party hereto to enforce
at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a
waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this
Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce
each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement
shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.  
Section 10.12. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to
involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have
to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative,
agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,

the foregoing waiver, (ii) each party understands and has considered the
implications of this waiver, (iii) each party makes this waiver voluntarily,
and (iv) each party has been induced to enter into this agreement by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section

law, any judgment in respect of a dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the
United States by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of such judgment
being conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.   Section
10.18. No Implied Representations.   (a) Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the  Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither the
Company, the Sellers nor  any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied  except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement.   (b) In connection with the Purchaser\'s investigation of the
MW  Companies in connection herewith, the Purchaser has received certain 
projections and other forecasts regarding the MW Companies. The Purchaser 
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such  projections and other forecasts, that the Purchaser is familiar with
such  uncertainties and that the Purchaser is taking full responsibility for
making  its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections  and other forecasts so furnished to it (including the
reasonableness of the  assumptions underlying such    -50-   projections
and other forecasts). Accordingly and without limiting the  foregoing,
neither the Company nor any Sellers make any representation or  warranty with
respect to such projections and other forecasts (including the 
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such projections and other 
forecasts).   Section 10.19. Stockholders Representative.   (a) Each
Stockholder, by the execution of this Agreement (and each  other Seller upon
execution of such other instrument of similar import entered  into by such
other Seller), agrees that the Stockholders Representative shall  be
authorized to act on behalf of such Sellers for all purposes of this 
Agreement with the full and exclusive power and authority to represent and 
bind such Seller with respect to all matters arising under and pursuant to 
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
taking  by the Stockholders Representative of any and all actions and the
making of  any decisions required or permitted to be taken) on such Seller\'s
behalf (a)  to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, (b) to pay
such Seller\'s  expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and
performance of this  Agreement (whether incurred on or after the date
hereof), (c) to disburse any  funds received hereunder to such Seller and
each other Seller, (d) to endorse  and deliver any certificates or
instruments representing the Shares, the  Options and the Class B Warrants
and execute such further instruments of  assignment as the Purchaser shall
reasonably request, (e) to execute and  deliver on behalf of such Seller any
amendment or waiver hereto, (f) to take  all other actions to be taken by or
on behalf of such Seller in connection  herewith, (g) to withhold funds to
pay Seller related expenses and  obligations, and (h) to do each and every
act and exercise any and all rights  which such Seller or the Sellers
collectively are permitted or required to do  or exercise under this
Agreement).   (b) As part of the power and authority granted under this
Section  10.19 and not in limitation, each Seller specifically consents to
the  Stockholders Representative\'s exercise of the power (i) to bring,
defend  and/or resolve any claim made pursuant to Article X, (ii) to agree
to,  negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, to bring suit or
seek  arbitration and to comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with  respect to such claims, and (iii) to take all actions
necessary in the  judgment of the Stockholders Representative for the
accomplishment of the  foregoing.   (c) Neither the Stockholders
Representative nor any agent employed  by it shall incur any liability to any
Seller by virtue of the failure or  refusal of the Stockholders
Representative for any reason to consummate the  transactions contemplated
hereby or relating to the performance of its other  duties hereunder, except
for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad  faith.   (d) In all
matters in which action by the Stockholders  Representative is required or
permitted, the Purchaser shall be entitled to  rely on any and all action
taken by the Stockholders Representative under this  Agreement without any
liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the  Sellers.   (e)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in no  event shall the
Stockholders Representative (A) take any action in respect of  any of the
foregoing that does    -51-   not, in all respects, treat each Seller in
a manner which is pro rata (based  on its ownership of the Company in the
aggregate, including all Shares,  Options and Warrants, held by such Seller
immediately prior to the Closing  calculated on a fully diluted basis) or (B)
amend this Agreement in any manner  whatsoever to expand, increase or alter
any Seller\'s liability and (ii) in no  event shall a Seller\'s liability
with respect to any of the foregoing exceed  (together with all related
liabilities and amounts paid in respect of Sections  10.1 and 10.2 herein or
any other section of this Agreement) such Seller\'s pro  rata portion, based
on the ownership of the Company in the aggregate,  including all Shares,
Options and Warrants, held by such Seller immediately  prior to the Closing
calculated on a fully-diluted basis, of any liability for  such
amounts.    (signatures on next page)    -52-   IN WITNESS WHEREOF,
