THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of December  5, 2019, by and between DTE ATLANTIC, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Purchaser_ "), and MARINA ENERGY LLC, a New
Jersey limited liability company (" _Seller_ "). Purchaser and Seller are
referred to herein collectively as the " _Parties_ " and individually as a "
_Party_."   Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meaning ascribed to such terms in _Article I_ hereof.

 

 

RECITALS:

 

 

WHEREAS, Seller is the legal and beneficial owner of one hundred percent
(100%) of the outstanding Equity (defined below) of ACB  Energy Partners LLC,
a New Jersey limited liability company (the " _Company_ ") (the " _Company
Equity Interests_ ");

 

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Company owns the assets comprising the
cogeneration facility located at the Project Site (as  hereinafter defined)
(the " _Cogen Facility_ ");

 

 

WHEREAS, prior to the Closing, Seller will cause certain assets to be
transferred to the Company subject to the terms and  conditions set forth in
this Agreement, which assets comprise the thermal generating facility known as
the Marina Thermal Facility (the " _Marina Thermal Facility,_ " and together
with the Cogen  Facility shall be referred to herein collectively as the "
_Facility_ ");

 

 

WHEREAS, the Facility provides heating, cooling, electricity, thermal energy,
and emergency generation to the Borgata hotel,  casino, and entertainment
complex located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and certain sales of wholesale
electricity from time to time;

 

 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Seller desires to sell to the Purchaser, and  the Purchaser
desires to purchase from Seller, all of the Company Equity Interests.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained herein, and other good and valuable  consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I

 

DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION

 

 

Section 1.1 _Definitions_.

 

 

For all purposes of this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided or
unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

 

 

" _$_ " or " _USD_ " means United  States Dollars.

 


 

     

" _Action_ " means any adverse administrative action, regulatory action,
judicial action,  suit, arbitration or adversarial proceeding by any Person
or by or before any Governmental Entity.

 

 

" _Affiliate_ " of any Person means a Person that directly or indirectly
through one or more  intermediaries' controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with, the first Person. For purposes of this definition, the
term "control," "controlled by" or "under common control with" means the
power, direct or indirect, to direct or  cause the direction of the
management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract, as trustee or executor, or otherwise. For the
avoidance of doubt, from and after the Closing the Company shall not be

Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Closing Estimated
Working Capital Statement is provided by the Seller to the  Purchaser for
informational purposes and to assist the Purchaser in verifying the Working
Capital following the Closing Date in accordance with _Section 2.3_.

 

 

Section 2.3 _Working Capital Adjustments and Requirements._

 

 

(a) The Initial Working  Capital Statement was prepared by Seller and is
attached as _Part A_ of _Schedule 2.2_. Prior to delivering the Closing
Estimated  Working Capital Statement pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ , the
Seller shall give the Purchaser reasonable prior written notice of the same
and allow the Purchaser to, at the Purchaser's own  cost and expense,
reasonably participate in the development of such statement and the Seller
shall provide the Purchaser and its representatives and accountants with

working papers, used by the Seller and their accountants to prepare the
Closing Estimated Working Capital Statement, as applicable, for the purpose of
verifying that the amounts set forth therein are determined in accordance with
the guidelines and  procedures set forth in this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

16  

(b) To the extent the  Purchaser reasonably determines during the forty-five
(45) day-period following the Closing Date that the Working Capital as of the
Closing Date was less than it otherwise would have been on the Closing Date
due to an action taken that was not  consistent with, or a failure to take an
action that was required by, _Section 7.17(a)_ , _Schedule 2.2_ or the other
applicable  provisions of this Agreement, then the Purchaser shall determine
the amount of such shortfall and shall provide notice of the same, with
reasonably detailed supporting information, to the Seller (such notice, the "
_Working Capital Shortfall Statement_ " and the shortfall described therein
the " _Working Capital Shortfall_ "). The Purchaser shall provide any Working
Capital  Shortfall Statement no later than the last day of such forty-five
(45) day-period.

 

 

(c) The Seller shall  complete its review of the Working Capital Shortfall
Statement within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof. Purchaser shall
provide the Seller and its respective representatives and accountants with

Statement for the purpose of verifying that the amounts set forth therein were
determined in accordance with the guidelines and procedures  set forth in
this Agreement.

 

 

(d) A Working Capital  Shortfall Statement shall be binding and conclusive
upon, and deemed accepted by, the Seller unless the Seller determines that
there is an inaccuracy in the Working Capital Shortfall Statement, or the
resulting Working Capital Shortfall  calculated therein, and the Seller
provides a notice of such determination to the Purchaser (a " _Working Capital
Objection_ ") within the time period described in _Section 2.3(c)_ ; provided
that the Seller may deliver only one Working Capital Objection and may not
amend its Working Capital Objection  once it has been delivered to the
Purchaser. The Working Capital Objection shall set forth a specific
description of the basis of such Working Capital Objection and the specific
adjustments to the Working Capital Shortfall reflected on the  Working
Capital Shortfall Statement which the Seller believes should be made. Any
items not disputed in a valid Working Capital Objection shall be deemed to
have been accepted by the Seller.

 

 

(e) If the Seller and the  Purchaser are unable to resolve all of their
disputes with respect to aspects of the Working Capital Shortfall Statement
within thirty (30) days following the Purchaser's receipt of a Working Capital
Objection, they shall refer their remaining  differences to Plante Moran (the
" _CPA Firm_ ") for a decision. The CPA Firm shall resolve any such
disagreements submitted to it acting as experts and not as arbitrators, and
its decision  shall be final and binding on the Parties upon delivery of the
written opinion set forth in _sub-clause (iii)_ below. The procedure and
schedule under which any dispute shall be submitted  to the CPA Firm shall be
as follows:

 

 

(i) The Seller shall  submit any unresolved elements of the Working Capital
Objection to the CPA Firm in writing (with a copy to the Purchaser), supported
by any documents or affidavits upon which the Seller relies. Failure to do so
without reasonable cause shall  constitute a withdrawal of the Working
Capital Objection with respect to any unresolved element to which such failure
relates.

 

 

(ii) Within fifteen (15)  days following the Seller's submission of the
unresolved elements of the Working Capital Objection as specified in _sub-
clause (i)_ above, the Purchaser shall submit its response to the  CPA Firm
in writing (with a copy to the Seller), supported by any documents or
affidavits upon which such response relies.

 


 

 

 

17  

(iii) The CPA Firm shall  deliver its written opinion within fifteen (15)
days following its receipt of the information provided for in _sub-clause
(ii)_ above, or such longer period of time as the CPA Firm  determines is
necessary, not to exceed thirty (30) days. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the CPA Firm is limited to the unresolved portion of the
applicable Working Capital Objection. The Purchaser and the Seller shall make
readily  available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records and any
working papers (including those of the Parties' respective accountants)
relating to the Working Capital Shortfall Statement and all other items
reasonably requested by the CPA Firm.

 

 

Any expenses relating to the engagement of the CPA Firm (the " _CPA Costs_ ")
shall be  allocated between the Purchaser and the Seller so that the Seller's
share of the CPA Costs shall be in the same proportion that (1) the aggregate
amount of the disputed items submitted by the Seller to the CPA Firm that are
unsuccessfully disputed  bears to (2) the total amount of all disputed items
submitted by the Seller to the CPA Firm. Each Party shall each bear the fees
of its respective accountants incurred in connection with the determination
and review of the Working Capital Shortfall  Statement.

 

 

(f) The Working Capital  Shortfall Statement, and the corresponding Working
Capital Shortfall, shall become final and binding on the Parties upon the
earliest of (i) if no Working Capital Objection has been given with respect to
the Working Capital Shortfall Statement, the  expiration of the period within
which the Seller must make its objection pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ , (ii)
agreement in writing by the Seller and Purchaser that the Working Capital 
Shortfall Statement, together with any modifications thereto agreed by the
Seller and Purchaser, shall be final and binding and (iii) the date on which
the CPA Firm shall issue its written determination with respect to any dispute
relating to the  Working Capital Shortfall Statement. The Working Capital
Shortfall set forth in the Working Capital Shortfall Statement that has become
final and binding pursuant to this _Section 2.3(f)_   shall be the " _Final
Working Capital Shortfall_ ".

 

 

(g) To the extent a Final  Working Capital Shortfall is determined pursuant
to this _Section 2.3_ , then within five (5) Business Days after the Working
Capital Shortfall Statement becomes final and binding on the  Parties in
accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_ , the Seller shall make payment of the Final
Working Capital Shortfall amount by wire transfer to Purchaser (or its
designee) in immediately  available funds. The Parties agree that any payment
of the Final Working Capital Shortfall pursuant to this _Section 2.3(g)_ shall
(i) be allocated to, and treated as an adjustment to, the  Purchase Price,
and (ii) not be treated as an indemnity payment subject to the provisions of
_Article XI_.

agree that, except as provided in this Section, the Purchase Price deemed paid

determined for those purposes, shall be allocated among those assets and for
those purposes in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder and as set forth on the allocation schedule (the "
_Allocation Schedule_ "). A draft of the Allocation Schedule shall be prepared
by Purchaser and delivered to Seller within forty-five (45) days following the
date of this Agreement. If Seller  notifies Purchaser, in writing, that
Seller objects to one or more items reflected in the Allocation Schedule
within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such Allocation Schedule, Purchaser and
Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to negotiate  to resolve
such dispute within one hundred twenty (120) days of Closing.

 

 

If Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with regard to the
Allocation Schedule within such one hundred twenty (120) day period,  Seller
and Purchaser shall be free to use their own allocation and/or determination
of the consideration in preparing their respective U.S. federal Tax Returns
and other filings.

 

 

Except as otherwise required by any final and non-appealable decision or Order
by any court of competent jurisdiction or by applicable Law, any  allocation
agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser, as provided above, shall be binding on
Seller and Purchaser for all income Tax reporting purposes, and Seller and
Purchaser shall not take (or cause or permit any Affiliate to take)
inconsistent  positions with respect to, and shall each use (and cause each
Affiliate to use) Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sustain, such agreed upon
allocation in any subsequent income Tax audit or similar proceeding, and each
of Seller and Purchaser agrees  to cooperate with the other in preparing an
IRS Form 8594, and to furnish the other with a draft copy of such form within
a reasonable period before its filing due date.

representatives reasonable access to such records during normal business hours
and (b) permit the requesting Party or its representatives to make copies of
such records, in each case at no cost to the  requesting Party or its

, _however_ that nothing  herein shall require any Party to disclose any
information to the other if such disclosure would result in the loss of any

destroying Party sends to the other Parties  written notice of its intent to
destroy such records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the
records to be destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the

requesting such  cooperation shall pay the out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and disbursements) of the Party providing such
cooperation and of its employees and agents reasonably incurred in connection
with providing such cooperation, but shall  not be responsible to reimburse
the Party providing such cooperation for the salaries or costs of fringe

change, development or occurrence which is the subject of a Schedule
Supplement would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to

Business Days following Purchaser's receipt of the applicable Schedule
Supplement;  _provided_ , that if Purchaser has the right to, but does not

outstanding are set forth on _Schedule 7.11_ (the " _Existing  Guarantees_
"). Prior to Closing, unless waived or otherwise agreed to by the Parties,
Purchaser shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the beneficiaries
of each Existing Guarantee to accept a substitute guarantee containing  terms
equal to or more favorable to the beneficiary thereof than the terms of such
Existing Guarantee (a " _Substitute Guarantee_ "). Promptly upon termination

Agreement, no other services shall be provided by Seller with respect to the
Company.

 

 

Section 7.14 _ISRA and Environmental Compliance_.

or penalties thereon, any cost or fees imposed by the NJ Tax Director related
thereto and any tax on the gain  from the sale of the Assets (collectively, "
_NJ Taxes_ "), exists and the amount thereof (the " _NJ Tax Deficiency_ "),
then Purchaser  and Seller shall close as scheduled and without delay, and
Purchaser shall withhold the portion of the Purchase Price equal to the amount
of the Deficiency, which amount so withheld shall be placed in an escrow

Company and any applicable Affiliates to, comply with the covenants set forth
in _Part B_ of _Schedule 2.2_ ; it being understood that any failure to comply

Working Capital or that the Working Capital was managed in a manner
inconsistent with the requirements of this Agreement, the Seller  shall
cooperate in good faith to address any reasonable request of the Purchaser
made in connection with such determination; it being understood that the
provisions of _Section 2.3_ shall  control any adjustments to the Purchase
Price after Closing.

Closing Date,  Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred
by any Seller Indemnified Party after the Closing as a result of or arising
out of:

 

 

(a) Any breach as of the  Closing Date of any representation or warranty (as
though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent a
representation or warranty is expressly made as of an earlier date, in which
case only as of such earlier date) of Purchaser in _Article VI_ of this
Agreement;

 

 

(b) Any breach by  Purchaser of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or

 

 

(c) Any Taxes of the  Company that are allocable to a period beginning after
the Lockdown Date.

 

 

Section 11.4 _Method of Asserting Claims_.

 

 

All claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party under this _Article
XI_ shall be  asserted and resolved as follows:

 

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any claim or demand in respect of which an
Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under this _Article XI_   is asserted
against such Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
the Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the " _Third   Party Claim
Notice_ ") and the details thereof including an estimate of the claimed Losses
(if known and quantifiable), the nature and basis of the alleged breach or act
giving rise to such claim and all relevant facts and  circumstances relating
thereto, including the provision(s) of this Agreement under which such
indemnification obligation arises, and copies of all relevant pleadings,
documents and information in the possession of the Indemnified Party to the 
Indemnifying Party within a period of thirty (30) days following the assertion
of the Third Party Claim against the Indemnified Party (the " _Third Party
Claim Notice Period_ "); _provided_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party within the Third Party Claim Notice Period shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the 
extent such failure shall have actually and materially prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party. Within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of the Third
Party Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall, in writing, either
acknowledge or deny its  obligations to indemnify and defend under this
_Article XI_.

 


 

 

 

55  

(b) If the Indemnifying  Party acknowledges its obligations to indemnify and
defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim within fifteen (15)
days after having been notified by the Indemnified Party of the existence of
such Third Party Claim, then the  Indemnifying Party shall defend such Third
Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be
diligently prosecuted to a final conclusion or will be settled, at the
discretion of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that imposes injunctive
or other equitable  relief against the Indemnified Party or does not fully
and finally release the Indemnified Party from all claims, unless consented to
by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will cooperate fully in such
defense, including by making  available to the Indemnifying Party all books,
records and documents within the Indemnified Party's control or that it can
reasonably obtain relating to the Third Party Claim, and all costs or expenses
incurred by it at the request of the  Indemnifying Party shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party may, at its cost and expense, at any
time to prevent default or protect its interests, file any pleadings or take
any other action that the Indemnified Party  reasonably believes to be
necessary or appropriate to protect its interests due to the failure of the
Indemnifying Party to diligently defend such Action. The Indemnified Party, at
its expense, may participate in, but not control (except as  provided in the
subsequent paragraph), any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
conducted by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 11.4(b)_.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary (other than _Section
11.4(e)_ ), the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of
such defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by  the Indemnified
Party) and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by
the Indemnified Party if (1) the claim for indemnification relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding, Action, 
indictment, allegation or investigation; (2) the claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (3) the Indemnifying Party
fails to acknowledge its obligations to indemnify and defend the Indemnified
Party against  the Third Party Claim within the fifteen (15) day time period;
(4) the named parties to any such suit, Action or proceeding (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party, and in the reasonable  judgment of outside counsel to the Indemnified
Party, representation of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by
the same counsel would be inadvisable due to actual or potential differing
defenses or conflicts of interests between them  that make joint
representation inappropriate; or (5) upon petition by the Indemnified Party,
the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing
to take reasonable steps to diligently prosecute or defend such Third Party 
Claim.

 


 

 

 

56  

(d) _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving
an Action brought pursuant to a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ")  
may be asserted by written notice to the Indemnifying Party, specifying, in
reasonable detail, the amount of Losses attributable to such claim to the
extent then known (if at all), the nature and basis of the alleged breach or
act giving rise to  such claim and all relevant facts and circumstances
relating thereto, including the provision(s) of this Agreement under which
such indemnification obligation arises. The Indemnifying Party shall have
fifteen (15) days following receipt of  notice of the Direct Claim to make
such investigation of the Direct Claim as the Indemnifying Party reasonably
considers necessary or appropriate. For the purpose of such investigation, the
Indemnified Party shall make available to the  Indemnifying Party the
information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Direct
Claim, together with all such other information as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request, except to the extent producing such information  would
violate attorney- client privilege, attorney work product or an applicable
confidentiality agreement or obligation. If both parties agree, at or prior to
the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period (or any mutually agreed upon
extension  thereof), to the validity and amount of such Direct Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay to the Indemnified Party the full
agreed-upon amount of the Direct Claim. No Indemnified Parties shall undertake
or cause to be undertaken or  allow any removal, remedial or response action
with respect to which any Indemnified Parties may be entitled to
indemnification without providing reasonable prior written notice to the
Indemnifying Party.

 

 

(e) _Tax Claims_. Notwithstanding the above provisions of this _Section 11.4_
, the procedures set forth in _Section 10.3_ , and not the provisions set
forth in the above provisions of _Section 11.4_ , shall govern audits and
administrative and judicial  proceedings with respect to Taxes.

 

 

(f) _Mitigation_.

 

 

(i) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnified Party will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate all
Losses relating to a claim.

 

 

(ii) Without limiting _Section 11.4(f)_ , if and to the extent that Purchaser
intends to assert any Direct Claim arising out of _Section 11.2(d),_
Purchaser  shall promptly notify Seller of the facts or circumstances giving
rise to such claim, and shall consult with Seller in good faith prior to
taking any action with respect to mitigating, remedying or resolving such
facts or circumstances; _provided_ that Purchaser shall have no obligation to
implement any specific recommendation made by Seller as a result of such
consultation.

 

 

Section 11.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

 

(a) No Purchaser  Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make an indemnity
claim, either individually or together with other related indemnity claims
arising out of the same event, facts or circumstances, for any Losses not
exceeding Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)  in the aggregate for such claim or
series of related claims. The limitations set forth in this _Section 11.5(a)_
shall not apply to a breach of any of the Seller's Fundamental 
Representations, the representations and warranties contained in _Section
5.15_ (Tax Matters), _Section 5.12_ (Environmental  Matters), the covenant
contained in _Section 7.1(l)_ or the indemnity in any of _Section 11.2(c)_ or
_Section 11.2(d)_.

 


 

 

 

57  

(b) Seller shall have no  liability arising out of or relating to _Section
11.2(a)_ and Purchaser shall have no liability arising out of or relating to
_Section  11.3(a)_ unless the aggregate Losses actually incurred by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, arising therefrom exceed one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price
(and then only to the extent  that such Losses exceed such amount). The
limitations set forth in this _Section 11.5(b)_ shall not apply to a breach of
any of the Seller's Fundamental Representations or the  representations and
warranties contained in _Section 5.15_ (Tax Matters).

 

 

(c) (i) Seller's liability  arising out of or relating to _Section 11.2_
(other than breaches of the Seller's Fundamental Representations and the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 5.15_ (Tax Matters) or
the indemnity in any of _Section 11.2(b)_ , _Section  11.2(c)_ , or _Section
11.2(d)_ ) shall not exceed twelve and one half percent (12.5%) of the
Purchase Price; (ii) Purchaser's liability arising out of or relating to
_Section 11.3_ (other than breaches of Purchaser's Fundamental
Representations) shall not exceed twelve and one half percent (12.5%) of the
Purchase Price; and  (iii) Seller's liability for breaches of any of Seller's
Fundamental Representations, the representations and warranties contained in
_Section 5.15_ (Tax Matters) or arising out of _Section 11.2(b)_ , _Section
11.2(c)_ , or _Section 11.2(d)_ and Purchaser's  liability for breaches of
Purchaser's Fundamental Representations, shall not exceed the Purchase Price;
_provided_ , _however_ ,  Seller's aggregate liability and Purchaser's
aggregate liability for all breaches of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement shall not exceed the
Purchase Price.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the limitations set forth in _Sections
11.5(a)_ , _11.5(b)_ and _11.5(c)_   shall not apply to any Losses resulting
from or arising out of fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or
intentional breach, and no recovery of any such Losses shall accrue towards or
reduce the limitations on liability set forth in _Section 11.5(c)_.

 

 

(e) For the avoidance of  doubt, the limitations set forth in _Sections
11.5(a)_ , _11.5(b)_ and _11.5(c)_   that pertain to _Section 11.2(a)_ or
_11.2(b)_ shall not apply to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to
_Section 11.2(d)_ on account of the fact that the facts and circumstances
giving rise to such indemnification claim constitute a breach of
representation or warranty set forth in this  Agreement or any covenant or
agreement made by Seller under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

 

 

Section 11.6 _Time Limits on Claims_.

 

 

(a) Except as provided  in this Section, other than in the event of fraud,
gross negligence or willful misconduct and with the exception of the
Fundamental Representations, no claim or Action may be brought under this
_Article   XI_ hereto for breach of a representation or warranty (i) under
_Section 5.12_ (Environmental Matters) more than three (3) years following the
Closing Date or (ii) under any  other Section (other than a Seller
Fundamental Representation) more than eighteen (18) months following the
Closing Date. Any claim for breach of a representation or warranty (other than
a Fundamental Representation) not made within the  foregoing applicable
relevant time period shall expire and be forever barred thereafter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim for a breach of a Fundamental
Representation or the representations and warranties contained in _Section
5.15_ (Tax Matters) shall survive until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations plus ninety (90) days.

 


 

 

 

58  

(b) The covenants and  agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement
that by their terms do not contemplate performance after the Closing shall
survive for eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, and the remaining
covenants and agreements shall survive  in accordance with their respective
terms until such covenant or agreement has been performed. For the avoidance
of doubt, any claim for a breach of the covenants and agreements in _Section
7.14_   shall not be subject to any time limitation.

 

 

(c) The applicable period  set forth in this _Section 11.6_ for each such
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement is referred to herein as the
" _Survival  Period_." Seller and Purchaser shall not have any liability for
indemnification claims made under this _Article XI_ with respect to any such
representation, warranty,  covenant or agreement after the applicable
Survival Period, if any, unless a written notice of claim is provided (in
accordance with the requirements of _Section 11.4_ ) prior to the  expiration
of such applicable Survival Period.

 

 

Section 11.7 _Tax Effect; Insurance Proceeds_.

 

 

The liability of the Indemnifying Party with respect to any Loss shall be
reduced by the Tax benefit actually realized, and any insurance proceeds 
actually received (whether pursuant to or as a result of _Section 7.7(b)_ or
otherwise) by the Indemnified Party as a result of any such Losses and shall
include any Tax detriment actually  suffered by the Indemnified Party as a
result of such Losses. Without limitation to the foregoing, no Party shall be
entitled to recover Losses from the other under this _Article XI_ to the 
degree that the affected Indemnified Party has already been made whole and
such indemnifiable Losses would constitute double recovery of amounts already
paid (directly or indirectly) to such Indemnified Party, pursuant to this
_Article XI_ or by third parties. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount
from a third party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification
hereunder after all or a portion of  such Loss has been paid by an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article XI_ , the Indemnified Party shall
promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (a) the amount
paid  by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount
received from the third party in respect thereof, over (b) the full amount of
such Loss (including all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees) incurred by the  Indemnified Party in recovering such amounts from a
third party in respect of such Loss).

 

 

Section 11.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_.

 

 

Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision  of
Applicable Law), Purchaser, Seller and their respective Affiliates shall treat
any and all indemnification payments under this _Article XI_ as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for all  Tax purposes. Any indemnification payments
made by Seller under this _Article XI_ shall be allocated to the applicable
Company Equity Interests which directly or indirectly represent an  Equity
interest in the Company that gave rise to the Loss resulting in the
indemnification payment.

capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules shall have the respective
meanings assigned to such terms in this Agreement. Each  numbered Schedule in
the Disclosure Schedules qualifies the correspondingly numbered
representation, warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein and such
other representations, warranties or covenants to the extent a matter in such
numbered  Schedule is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to
such other representation, warranty or covenant reasonably apparent on the
face of the disclosure.
