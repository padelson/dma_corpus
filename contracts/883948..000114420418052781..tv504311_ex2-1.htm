AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of October 4, 2018, between UNION BANKSHARES CORPORATION, a
Virginia corporation (" _UBSH_ "), and ACCESS NATIONAL CORPORATION, a Virginia
corporation (" _ANCX_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of UBSH and ANCX have approved, and deem it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders
to consummate, the business combination transaction provided for herein in
which ANCX will merge with and into UBSH (the " _Merger_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of UBSH and ANCX have each determined that
the Merger is consistent with and will further their respective
business strategies and goals; and

  



  

WHEREAS, as an inducement for each party to enter into this Agreement,
certain shareholders of each of UBSH and ANCX have simultaneously herewith
entered into affiliate agreements in the form of _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_
, respectively, in connection with the Merger (collectively, the " _Affiliate
Agreements_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that, for federal income tax
purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), and the Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code (and any
future amendments to such regulations and any corresponding provisions of
succeeding regulations) (the " _Treasury Regulations_ "), and that this
Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) for purposes of
Sections 354, 356 and 361 of the Code (and any comparable provision of state
Law) for federal and applicable state income tax purposes.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE 1 
 THE MERGER AND RELATED MATTERS

  



  

Section 1.1 The Merger.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with
the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the " _VSCA_ "), at the Effective Time
(as defined in _Section 1.3_ ), ANCX will be merged with and into UBSH
pursuant to the Plan of Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit C_ and made a part hereof (the " _Plan of Merger_ "). The
separate corporate existence of ANCX thereupon shall cease, and UBSH will be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (UBSH is referred to herein as the "
_Continuing Corporation_ " whenever reference is made to it as of the
Effective Time or thereafter). The Merger will have the effect set forth in
Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA.

  



    

 | 1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 1.2 Closing.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. at the offices of
Covington and Burling LLP, 850 10th St NW, Washington, DC 20001 on the date that
the Effective Time occurs, which date shall be no later than three (3)
business days following the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law)
of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature only can be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless accelerated or
extended as both parties may agree (the  " _Closing Date_ "). All documents
required by this Agreement to be delivered at or prior to the Closing Date
will be exchanged by the parties at or by the Closing.

  



  

Section 1.3 Effective Time.

  



  

On the Closing Date, UBSH and ANCX will execute and file articles of merger
meeting the requirements of Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA, including
containing the Plan of Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), with the
Virginia State Corporation Commission (the " _SCC_ "). The Merger shall
become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger is issued by the SCC
(or at such later time as may be specified by mutual agreement of the parties
in the Articles of Merger), as provided in Sections 13.1-720 and 13.1-606 of
the VSCA (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.4 Corporate Governance and Related Matters.

  



  

On or prior to the Effective Time, subject to compliance by the Board of
Directors of the Continuing Corporation with its fiduciary duties
(including compliance with the Continuing Corporation's Organizational
Documents and Corporate Governance Guidelines), the Board of Directors of
UBSH shall cause Michael W. Clarke, or, if Mr. Clarke is unable or unwilling
to serve as a director of the Continuing Corporation, a director of ANCX that
is mutually agreeable to ANCX and UBSH, (the " _ANCX Director_ ") to be
appointed as a director of the Continuing Corporation as of the Effective
Time to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders of the
Continuing Corporation following the Effective Time. Subject to compliance by
the Board of Directors of the Continuing Corporation with its fiduciary
duties (including compliance with the Continuing Corporation's Organizational
Documents and Corporate Governance Guidelines), the Continuing Corporation
shall nominate the ANCX Director for reelection to the Board of Directors
of the Continuing Corporation at the first annual meeting of the shareholders
of the Continuing Corporation following the Effective Time, and the
Continuing Corporation's proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting
shall include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Continuing
Corporation that its shareholders vote to reelect the ANCX Director to the
same extent as recommendations are made with respect to other directors on
the Board of Directors of the Continuing Corporation.

Section 1.5 Banking Operations.

  



  

(a) After the Effective Time, Access National Bank, a national
banking association and wholly owned subsidiary of ANCX (" _Access National
Bank_ "), shall merge with and into Union Bank and Trust, a Virginia chartered
bank and wholly owned subsidiary of UBSH (" _Union Bank_ ") (the " _Bank
Merger_ "), pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of
Merger substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Bank Merger
Agreement_ ") and the separate existence of Access National Bank shall cease
and Union Bank shall survive and continue to exist as a bank incorporated and
chartered under the Laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. UBSH may at any time
change the method or timing of effecting the combination of Access National
Bank and Union Bank if and to the extent UBSH deems such changes necessary,
appropriate or desirable for any reason in its discretion (including to
ensure that the Merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code); provided, that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of Merger Consideration (as defined herein), (ii)
adversely affect the ability of the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (iii) materially impede or
delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv)
result in the Bank Merger occurring prior to the Merger of ANCX and UBSH; and
provided, further, that (x) UBSH shall provide ANCX with five days' prior
written notice of such change and the reasons therefor, and (y) UBSH shall not
make any change that would materially affect the Tax consequences to ANCX or
its shareholders without the prior written consent of ANCX (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(b) On or prior to the effective time of the Bank Merger, UBSH as
the sole shareholder of Union Bank shall cause the ANCX Director to be
appointed as a director of Union Bank as of the effective time of the Bank
Merger to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholder of Union
Bank following the Effective Time. Provided that the ANCX Director continues
to be eligible to serve as a director of the Continuing Corporation, and
subject to compliance by the Board of Directors of Union Bank with its
fiduciary duties (including compliance with Union Bank's Organizational
Documents and Corporate Governance Guidelines) Union Bank shall nominate the
ANCX Director for reelection to the Board of Directors of Union Bank at the
first annual meeting of the shareholder of Union Bank following the Effective
Time.

  



  

Section 1.6 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Continuing
Corporation.

  



  

As of the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation, as amended, of UBSH
(the " _UBSH Articles_ ") and bylaws, as amended, of UBSH, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of the Continuing Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

Section 1.7 Tax Consequences.

  



  

Each of the parties intends, and undertakes and agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action which would cause the
Merger not, to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder for
federal and applicable state income tax purposes. The parties adopt this
Agreement as a  "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) for purposes of Sections 354, 356 and 361 of
the Code (and any comparable provision of state Law) for federal and
applicable state income tax purposes. ANCX and UBSH shall prepare and file
with each of their respective Tax Returns all information required by Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-3 and related provisions of the Treasury Regulations
in a manner consistent with treating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code and
shall take no position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with this treatment unless required to do so by applicable law.
Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their
appropriate officers to execute and deliver to its respective counsel,
certificates containing appropriate representations and covenants, reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel, at such time or times as
may be reasonably requested by such counsel, including as of the effective
date of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Closing Date, in connection with
such counsel's deliveries of opinions with respect to the Tax treatment of the
Merger.

  



  

Section 1.8 Appraisal Rights.

  



  

In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no appraisal rights shall be
available to the holders of ANCX Common Stock in connection with the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE 2 
 MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

  



  

Section 2.1 Conversion of Shares.

  



  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of UBSH, ANCX or any holder of any of the following securities:

  



  

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $1.33 per share, of UBSH
(" _UBSH Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of
the Continuing Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  



  

(b) All shares of common stock, par value $0.835 per share, of ANCX
(" _ANCX Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are owned, directly or indirectly, by UBSH or ANCX (other
than shares of ANCX Common Stock held in trust accounts (including grantor or
rabbi trust accounts), managed accounts and similar accounts, or otherwise
held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third
parties) (any such shares, the " _ANCX Cancelled Shares_ ") shall no longer
be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Each share of ANCX Common Stock, except for ANCX Cancelled
Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will cease to be outstanding and will be converted automatically into and
exchanged for the right to receive 0.75 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value
$1.33 per share, of the Continuing Corporation (" _Continuing Corporation
Common Stock_ ") (with respect to a given share of ANCX Common Stock, the  "
_Merger Consideration_ "); it being understood that upon the Effective Time,
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ , UBSH Common Stock, including the shares issued
to former holders of ANCX Common Stock, shall be the Continuing Corporation
Common Stock, and use its reasonable best efforts to make the Letter of
Transmittal available to any such shareholder who requests such Letter of
Transmittal following the initial delivery of the Letter of Transmittal.

been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number
or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar change in
capitalization, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made to
the Exchange Ratio, and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement.

Consideration.

  



  

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, UBSH shall, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article 2_ , (i) deposit, or cause to be deposited,

in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock, to the
extent determinable, and (ii) evidence of shares in book-entry form,
representing the shares of the Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be
issued and paid pursuant to this _Article 2_ (collectively with the cash

(c) _Letter of Transmittal_. UBSH shall prepare appropriate and
customary transmittal materials (such materials and instructions to
include customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message"
with respect to Book-Entry Shares) on which UBSH and ANCX shall mutually

specify that delivery of the Letter of Transmittal and, as applicable, title
and risk of loss with respect to (i) an outstanding Certificate or
outstanding Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represent outstanding shares of ANCX Common Stock (the  " _Certificates_ "),
and (ii) uncertificated shares of ANCX Common Stock represented by book-entry
(" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case other than ANCX Cancelled Shares,
shall be effected only upon proper delivery of the completed Letter of
Transmittal and, as applicable and subject to _Section 2.3(d)_ , the surrender
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent. UBSH shall
make available and mail the Letter of Transmittal not more than five (5)
business days after the Effective Time to all Persons who were record holders

Section 2.3 Exchange of Shares.

  



  

(a) Each holder of an outstanding share of ANCX Common Stock who has
properly surrendered their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent (or has complied with _Section 2.3(d)_ ), together with a Letter of
Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documentation as the Exchange Agent and
UBSH may require, shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with
respect to such share of ANCX Common Stock in non-certificated book-entry form
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.6_ in respect of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_ , in
accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Whenever a holder of an outstanding share of ANCX Common Stock
shall become entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.3(a)_ , in addition to the rights of such holder set forth in
_Section 2.4_ , any such holder shall be entitled to receive:

  



  

(i) evidence of issuance in non-certificated book-entry form the
number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which
the aggregate number of shares of ANCX Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement; and

  



  

(ii) a check representing the amount of cash for fractional shares,
if any, into which the aggregate number of shares of ANCX Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.6_  of this
Agreement.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, the Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to
deliver the Merger Consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional shares to
which any holder of ANCX Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger
until such holder surrenders his, her or its Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, or otherwise complies with _Section 2.3(d)_ , for exchange as
provided in _Section 2.3(a)_. Whenever a holder of an outstanding share of
ANCX Common Stock shall become entitled to receive any Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, the Continuing Corporation shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver
such Merger Consideration to such holder within two (2) business days
thereafter.

  



  

(c) _Abandoned Property._ Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither the Continuing Corporation nor the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to a holder of ANCX Common Stock for any amounts paid
or property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property Law.

  



  

(d) _Lost Certificates_. A holder of ANCX Common Stock whose
Certificates have been lost, destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing
shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and dividends or
distributions to which such shareholder shall be entitled, if any, upon
compliance with reasonable conditions imposed by the Continuing Corporation
and the Exchange Agent pursuant to applicable Law and as required in
accordance with the Continuing Corporation's and the Exchange Agent's
respective standard policies (including the requirement that the shareholder
furnish an affidavit of lost certificate, surety bond or other customary
indemnity).

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Continuing Corporation;
provided, that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration, and the Continuing Corporation shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of ANCX
Common Stock in the amount of any such losses to the extent necessary for
payment of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration. Any interest or other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Continuing
Corporation or as directed by the Continuing Corporation. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains
unclaimed by the former holders of ANCX Common Stock for 12 months after the
Effective Time shall, to the extent permitted by Law, be paid to the
Continuing Corporation. Any former holder of ANCX Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article 2_ shall thereafter look only to the
Continuing Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
Continuing Corporation Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former
share of ANCX Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.

  



  

(f) _Rounding_. All dollar amounts payable to any registered holder
of ANCX Common Stock pursuant to this _Article 2_ shall be rounded to the
nearest whole cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward), based on the
aggregate amount payable for all shares of ANCX Common Stock registered in
such shareholder's name.

  



  

Section 2.4 Rights of Former Holders of ANCX Common Stock.

  



  

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of ANCX shall be closed as to
holders of ANCX Common Stock, and no transfer of ANCX Common Stock by
any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for
exchange in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.3(a)_ , each Book-
Entry Share or Certificate shall from and after the Effective Time represent
for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor. To the extent permitted by Law,
former holders of record of ANCX Common Stock shall be entitled to vote after
the Effective Time at any meeting of Continuing Corporation shareholders the
number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which their
respective shares of ANCX Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether
such holders have surrendered their Book-Entry Shares or Certificates for
exchange as provided in _Section 2.3(a)_. Whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by the Continuing Corporation on Continuing
Corporation Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no
dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of
ANCX Common Stock, if any, as of any time subsequent to the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the holder of any Book-Entry Share or Certificate
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time until such holder surrenders such
Book-Entry Share or Certificate for exchange as provided in _Section 2.3(a)_.
However, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate representing
ANCX Common Stock, the Merger Consideration, together with all such
undelivered dividends or other distributions without interest, shall be
delivered and paid with respect to each Book-Entry Share or other share
represented by such Certificate.

Section 2.5 ANCX Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

  



  

(a) _Section 2.5(a)_ of the ANCX's Disclosure Letter lists all of
the equity or equity-based compensation plans maintained by ANCX under which
awards are currently outstanding or any awards may be made thereunder (each,
an " _ANCX Stock Plan_ "). At the Effective Time, each option to purchase
shares of ANCX Common Stock (an " _ANCX Stock Option_ ") granted under an
ANCX Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, (i) only with
respect to ANCX Stock Options granted on or before the date of this
Agreement, fully vest to the extent not previously vested, (ii) cease to
represent a right to purchase shares of ANCX Common Stock, and (iii) convert
automatically into an option to purchase a number of shares of UBSH Common
Stock (each, a " _Converted Stock Option_ ") equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the total number of shares of ANCX Common Stock subject to
such ANCX Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the
Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down the next lower whole
number of shares. Each Converted Stock Option will have an exercise price per
share of UBSH Common Stock equal to (A) the per share exercise price for the
shares of ANCX Common Stock subject to such ANCX Stock Option, _divided by_
(B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. In the case of
any ANCX Stock Option that is intended to qualify as an incentive stock
option under Section 421 of the Code, the adjustments described above will be
made in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.424-1(a), and for each other ANCX Stock
Option in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D). Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Converted
Stock Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
applicable to the converted ANCX Stock Option under the applicable ANCX Stock
Plan and the agreements evidencing the relevant grants thereunder, other than
with respect to vesting for ANCX Stock Options granted on or before the
date of this Agreement. Any Converted Stock Option that is an ANCX Stock
Option granted after the date of this Agreement (except with respect to any
ANCX Stock Option granted to a director of ANCX) shall continue to be subject
to the vesting terms in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
unless otherwise agreed in writing by UBSH.

  



  

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
ANCX or a committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions
of this _Section 2.5_ , including, but not limited to, delivering written
notice (in form reasonably approved by UBSH) to each holder of an ANCX Stock
Option of the treatment of such award pursuant to this _Section 2.5_.

  



  

Section 2.6 No Fractional Shares.

  



  

Each holder of shares of ANCX Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger
which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock multiplied
by the product of (i) the average of the closing sale prices of UBSH Common
Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") for the ten (10) full
trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding (but not
including) the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

Section 2.7 Withholding Rights.

  



  

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined herein) Law. The Continuing Corporation will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable by it pursuant to
_Article 2_ of this Agreement to any Person such amounts, if any, as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as defined
herein) Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to
the appropriate Governmental Authority by the Exchange Agent or by the
Continuing Corporation, such amounts withheld will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or the
Continuing Corporation, respectively.

(v) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be
so qualified, as reflected in a current favorable determination letter or is
maintained under a prototype or volume submitter plan and is entitled to rely
upon a favorable opinion or advisory letter, as applicable issued by the

such qualification or exemption. There have been no "terminations," "partial
terminations" or "discontinuances of contributions," as such terms are used
in Section 411 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, to any tax-

contingent) for breach of, or has breached its, fiduciary duty under ERISA.

  



  

(viii) There are no actions, suits, investigations or claims pending, or
to its Knowledge threatened or anticipated, with respect to any Benefit Plans

Guaranty Corporation, or any other federal or state governmental department
or entity.

  



  

(ix) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) (A) result in, cause the vesting,

payment, right or other benefit to any current or former employee, leased
employee, independent contractor, officer, director or other service provider
of it or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) result in any (1) requirement to fund
any benefits or set aside benefits in a trust (including a rabbi trust) or

trust. On or after the date hereof, but prior to the Effective Time, ANCX
shall deliver to UBSH its preliminary estimate and analysis as to whether any
amount paid or payable to any of its employees or independent contractors
(whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by it or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (the " _280G Analysis_ "). Neither
ANCX nor its Subsidiaries are required to make or will make any payments or
provide any benefits that will be an "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code. In addition to the foregoing, except as
otherwise set forth in _Section 3.2(p)(ix)_ of ANCX's Disclosure Letter, no
amounts payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) shall be non-
deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code. No Benefit Plan maintained
by it or any of its Subsidiaries provides for the gross-up or reimbursement

letter with the Department of Labor for each such plan.

  



  

(xi) It and its Subsidiaries have made prior to the date hereof all

administered in accordance with the requirements of the ACA. It and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all respects with the requirements of Section
4980H of the Code so as to avoid the imposition of any Taxes or assessable
payments thereunder. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
or obligation to provide post-retirement or post-termination health, medical
or life insurance benefits to any employees or former employees, leased
employees, independent contractors, officers, or directors, or any dependent
or beneficiary thereof, except as otherwise required under state or federal
benefits continuation Laws for which the covered individual pays the full
cost of coverage. In the case of any such required continuation coverage,
except as set forth in _Section 3.2(p)(xii)_  of ANCX's Disclosure Letter,
the covered individual is required to pay the full cost of coverage. No Tax
under Code Sections 4980B, 4980H or 5000 has been incurred with respect to
any Benefit Plan and to its Knowledge no circumstance exists which could give
rise to such Tax.

  



  

(xiii) No Benefit Plan maintained by it or its Subsidiaries (other than
an ANCX Stock Plan, ANCX Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan or the
ANCX 401(k) Plan) permits investments in equity of ANCX or investments in
which the value is based on or associated with equity of ANCX or UBSH.

(iii) All UBSH Benefit Plans are in compliance in all material
respects with applicable Laws, including without limitation ERISA and

Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal
Revenue Service to be so qualified, as reflected in a current favorable
determination letter or is maintained under a prototype or volume submitter
plan and is entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion or advisory letter, as
applicable issued by the Internal Revenue Service. To its Knowledge, nothing
has occurred since the date of any such determination that is reasonably
likely to affect adversely such qualification or exemption. There have been
no "terminations," "partial terminations" or "discontinuances of
contributions," as such terms are used in Section 411 of the Code and the
regulations thereunder, to any tax-qualified plan during the preceding five

risks and in such amounts as its management reasonably has determined to be
prudent in accordance with industry practices, and are in compliance in all
material respects with their insurance policies and are not in Default under
any of the terms thereof. Each such insurance policy is outstanding and in
full force and effect, and, except for policies insuring against potential
liabilities of officers, directors and employees of it and its Subsidiaries,
it or its relevant Subsidiary is the sole named beneficiary of such policies,
and all premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been paid,
and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion. Since

notice of a premium increase or cancellation or a failure to renew with
respect to any insurance policy or bond or, within the last three (3)
calendar years and since January 1, 2018 has been refused any insurance
coverage sought or applied for, and it has no reason to believe that existing
insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when the same shall expire upon
terms and conditions as favorable as those presently in effect, other than
possible increases in premiums or unavailability of coverage that do not
result from any extraordinary loss experience on the part of it or its
Subsidiaries. Set forth in _Section 3.2(r)_ of its Disclosure Letter is a
list of all insurance policies or bonds currently maintained by it and its
Subsidiaries.

or omissions which could give rise to any claim or right of rescission, set-

or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take
appropriate steps to correct the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 5.5(a)_ , nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit ANCX, prior to the ANCX Shareholders Meeting and
subject to compliance with the other terms of this _Section 5.5_ , from
furnishing confidential or nonpublic information to, or engaging or
participating in discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from
a breach of this _Section 5.5_ ) if (i) the Board of Directors of ANCX
concludes in good faith, after consultation with ANCX's outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the failure to take such actions would be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its
shareholders under applicable Law, (ii) before furnishing any confidential or
nonpublic information, ANCX receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less restrictive (with respect to each
provision) than the Confidentiality Agreements, which confidentiality
agreement shall not provide such Person with any exclusive right to negotiate

given such access shall have previously been provided to UBSH, and (iii)
Board of Directors of ANCX concludes in good faith, after consultation
with ANCX's outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal (as defined below). ANCX shall immediately (within twenty
four (24) hours) notify UBSH orally and in writing of its receipt of any such
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or any inquiry
that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions thereof, and the identity of the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal, and will thereafter keep UBSH apprised of
any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis,
including by providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence
relating thereto.

  



  

(c) The term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal, indication
of interest or inquiry (whether communicated to ANCX or publicly announced to
ANCX's shareholders and whether binding or non-binding) by any Person
relating to any of the following transactions or series of related
transactions involving ANCX, or its Subsidiaries: (i) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving ANCX or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of ANCX; (ii)
any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of ANCX and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class
of equity or voting securities of ANCX or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated
assets of ANCX; or (iii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party

including the likelihood of obtaining financing and of receiving all required
approvals of Governmental Authorities, and including the terms and conditions
of this Agreement (as it may be proposed in writing to be amended by UBSH)) is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, and, if
consummated, would result in a transaction that is more favorable to the
shareholders of ANCX from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (as it may be proposed in writing to be
amended by UBSH); provided, that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior
Proposal," "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in _Section 5.5(c)_ , except the reference to "25% or more" in
such definition shall be deemed to be a reference to "50% or more".

party, the approval or recommendation of the Board of Directors of ANCX or
UBSH, as applicable, or any such committee thereof with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (a " _Change in ANCX
Recommendation_ " or a " _Change in UBSH Recommendation_ ," respectively).

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to the ANCX Shareholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of
ANCX may (i) make a Change in ANCX Recommendation (although the resolutions
approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the Board of Directors of ANCX may communicate the
basis for its lack of ANCX Board Recommendation to its shareholders in the
Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by Law or (ii) terminate the Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(i)_ and enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal subject to compliance with _Section 7.4(b)_ ; provided,
that the Board of Directors of ANCX may only take actions under this _Section
5.5(f)_ , if, (A) an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (that
did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.5_ ) is made to ANCX by a
third party, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, (B) the Board
of Directors of ANCX has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
outside financial and legal advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the Board of Directors of ANCX have
concluded in good faith (after consultation with their financial and legal
advisors) that failure to do so would be a violation of its fiduciary duties
to its shareholders under applicable Law, (D) five (5) business days shall
have elapsed since ANCX has given written notice to UBSH advising UBSH that
ANCX intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the
reasons therefor, including, all information required to be delivered under

amendment to any material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a
new Notice of Change and determination as referred to in this
_Section 5.5(f)_ ), (E) during such five (5) business day period, ANCX has
and has caused its outside financial and legal advisors to, consider and, at
the reasonable request of UBSH, engage in good faith discussions with UBSH
regarding, any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by UBSH, and (F) the Board of Directors of ANCX, following
such five (5) business day period, again reasonably determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, and
taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by UBSH by the conclusion of such five (5)
business day period) that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would be
a violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable Law.
Notwithstanding a Change in ANCX Recommendation, unless this Agreement has
been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the ANCX Shareholders Meeting
shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders
of ANCX at the ANCX Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of voting on the
approval of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby.

any time prior to the UBSH Shareholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of
UBSH may make a Change in UBSH Recommendation (although the resolutions
approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the Board of Directors of UBSH may communicate the
basis for its lack of UBSH Board Recommendation to its shareholders in the
Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by Law; provided, that the Board of Directors of UBSH may
only take actions under this _Section 5.5(g)_ , if(A) the Board of
Directors of UBSH have concluded in good faith (after consultation with their
outside financial and legal advisors) that failure to do so would be a

period, UBSH has and has caused its outside financial and legal advisors to,
consider and, at the reasonable request of ANCX, engage in good faith
discussions with ANCX regarding, any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement proposed in writing by ANCX, and (D) the Board of Directors
of UBSH, following such five business day period, again reasonably determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial and legal
advisors, and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement proposed in writing by ANCX by the conclusion of such five
business day period) that failure to take such action would be a violation of
its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable Law.

representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons

would reasonably be expected to be materially financially burdensome to the
business, operations, financial condition or results of operations on
UBSH's business or on the business of ANCX or Access National Bank (which
restriction, commitment, or condition could include materially increasing
capital, divesting or reducing lines of businesses or asset classes, entering

Section 5.8 Employee Benefit Plans.

  



  

(a) As of the Effective Time and for a period of one year thereafter
(or such shorter period of employment, as the case may be), the
Continuing Corporation shall provide to employees of ANCX and its
Subsidiaries, who after the Effective Time become employees of the
Continuing Corporation or its Subsidiaries (" _ANCX Continuing Employees_ ")
(i) base salary or wages that are comparable to the base salary or wages
provided to either (x) such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
or (y) similarly situated employees of the Continuing Corporation and its
Subsidiaries; (ii) incentive compensation opportunities that are comparable
to the incentive compensation opportunities provided to either (x) such
employee immediately prior to the Effective Time or (y) similarly situated
employees of the Continuing Corporation and its Subsidiaries; and (iii)
employee benefits (other than equity incentive compensation and defined
benefit retirement benefits) which are, in the aggregate, comparable to the
employee benefits provided to either (x) such employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time or (y) similarly situated employees of the Continuing
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, in each case of clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii), with the choice between sub-clauses (x) and (y) to be determined by
UBSH in its sole discretion; provided that the Continuing Corporation may
provide such benefits to ANCX Continuing Employees under the Benefit Plans of
ANCX or a Subsidiary, under benefit plans maintained by the Continuing
Corporation (" _Continuing Corporation Plans_ ") or by a combination thereof.

  



  

(b) For purposes of eligibility and participation (except as
otherwise provided below for paid-time off), in any benefit plan of the
Continuing Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, but not benefit accrual,
service with or credited by ANCX or any of its Subsidiaries
(including service with any predecessor of ANCX or any of its Subsidiaries)
shall be treated as service with the Continuing Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to the same extent that such service was recognized by ANCX under
a corresponding Benefit Plan; provided, that such recognition of service
shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of an ANCX Continuing Employee
with respect to the same period of service or (ii) apply for purposes of any
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement (x) under which similarly-
situated employees of the Continuing Corporation or its Subsidiaries do not
receive credit for prior service or (y) that is grandfathered or frozen,
either with respect to level of benefits or participation.

  



    

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) ANCX shall amend its paid time off policy effective as of no
later than December 31, 2018, to provide that employees may rollover to a
subsequent calendar year no more than 40 hours of unused paid time off. On or
before December 31, 2018 (or such other time as may be mutually agreed in
writing between ANCX and UBSH), ANCX and its Subsidiaries shall pay to
employees any accrued and unused paid time off in excess of 40 hours. ANCX
shall provide to UBSH all information and documentation reasonably requested
by UBSH evidencing the foregoing. UBSH shall have a right to review and
approve in advance (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
the policy amendment and related employee communications. From and after the
Effective time, the vacation and paid-time off policies of ANCX and its
Subsidiaries shall be frozen and ANCX Continuing Employees shall be covered
under the applicable policy of Union Bank. For purposes of vacation and sick
leave under the Union Time Away From Work Policy (" _Union PTO Policy_
"), ANCX Continuing Employees shall receive credit for purposes of
eligibility and future benefit accrual for prior service with ANCX or any of
its Subsidiaries and shall be eligible to rollover into the "PTOR" subaccount
of the Union PTO Policy for use for vacation or sick time, up to a maximum of
40 hours of unused amounts that were carried over from the prior year under
ANCX's paid time off policy.

  



  

(d) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, the Continuing
Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
welfare Continuing Corporation Plans that cover the ANCX Continuing Employees
after the Effective Time to (i) waive any waiting period and restrictions and
limitations for preexisting conditions or insurability (except for pre-
existing conditions that were excluded, or restrictions or limitations that
were applicable, under the corresponding Benefit Plans of ANCX or a
Subsidiary), and (ii) cause any deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-
pocket payments made by the ANCX Continuing Employees under welfare Benefit
Plans maintained by ANCX for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs
to be credited to such ANCX Continuing Employees under welfare Continuing
Corporation Plans for the same plan year, so as to reduce the amount of any
deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments payable by such
ANCX Continuing Employees under welfare Continuing Corporation Plans.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, ANCX shall vest 100% all accrued
benefits for affected participants under the Access National
Corporation Profit Sharing Plan (the " _ANCX 401(k) Plan_ "), effective on
and subject to the consummation of the Merger. Following the Effective Time,
UBSH shall cause the ANCX 401(k) Plan to be merged into the 401(k) plan
maintained by UBSH (the " _UBSH 401(k) Plan_ " and together with the ANCX
401(k) Plan, each a " _401(k) Plan_ "), with such merger to be completed by
December 31, 2019. Each party agrees to amend its 401(k) Plan to the extent
necessary to ensure that there is no duplication of participation or benefits
under the 401(k) Plans and ANCX agrees to amend the ANCX 401(k) Plan,
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, to provide that no
additional amounts under the ANCX 401(k) Plan may be invested in the ANCX
stock fund under the ANCX 401(k) Plan on or after the Effective Time, and to
timely distribute any and all required notices to
participants, beneficiaries, shareholders or others in connection with such
amendment and to timely take any and all other action required in connection
with such amendment. To the extent any employer matching contributions for
2018 have been accrued under, but not yet contributed to, the ANCX 401(k)
Plan as of the Effective Time, the Continuing Corporation shall make or shall
cause its Subsidiary to make, such contributions to the ANCX 401(k) Plan in a
timely manner. No ANCX Continuing Employee shall be eligible to
participate in the 2018 UBSH/Union Bank profit sharing program, which amounts
are (if any) payable in 2019. Without limiting the foregoing, it is the
intent of UBSH that ANCX Continuing Employees, to the extent the applicable
employee meets the other eligibility requirements therein, shall be eligible
for the Union Bankshares Corp. Employee Stock Ownership Plan not earlier than
the regular entry date under such plan that first follows the Effective Time.

agree that _Section 5.8(f)_ of ANCX's Disclosure Letter shall apply to such
employees. UBSH will decide prior to the Effective Time which of those
employees will receive an offer of employment with the Continuing Corporation.
Any such employee who receives and accepts an offer of employment will be
employed by the Continuing Corporation or a Subsidiary as an at-will employee
and pursuant to terms established by the Continuing Corporation and will be an
ANCX Continuing Employee. Any such ANCX Continuing Employee shall be
eligible, immediately following the Effective Time, to become a participant in
a Continuing Corporation severance plan, based on his or her position with
the Continuing Corporation, if any such plan is available to similarly
situated employees of the Continuing Corporation.

  



  

(g) At the written request of UBSH, with such written request
provided to ANCX in a timely manner as to allow ANCX to comply with
any notice requirements under any applicable Benefit Plan or related service
contract, ANCX shall terminate any Benefit Plan of ANCX or a Subsidiary
(other than the ANCX 401(k) Plan), in accordance with applicable Law and

Effective Time, ANCX shall notify UBSH in writing of: (i) all
terminations, hiring, engagements and promotions of employee or independent
contractor after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time permitted by
_Section 4.1(e)_ and (ii) increases in compensation and benefits, bonus
payments and equity grants permitted by _Section 4.1(e)_.

  



  

(i) Within 30 days following the date hereof, ANCX will provide to
UBSH a supplement _Section 3.2(o)(i)(A)_ of ANCX's Disclosure Letter that
includes, for each employee the following information: whether full-time or
part-time, Fair Labor Standards Act designation, current annual bonus
opportunity, fringe benefits (other than employee benefits applicable to all
employees), bonus payouts for the past three years, and immigration status.

  



  

(j) Nothing in this _Section 5.8_ shall (i) constitute an amendment
to any Benefit Plan or any UBSH Benefit Plan, (ii) be construed to limit the
right of the Continuing Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, from and after
the Effective Time, to amend or terminate any of the benefit plans maintained
by UBSH or ANCX or their respective Subsidiaries before the Effective Time to
the extent that such benefit plans permit any such amendment or termination,
or (iii) confer on any Continuing Employee or any other Person any rights to
employment or other service relationship.

  



  

Section 5.9 Nasdaq Listing.

  



  

UBSH shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of the
Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued to holders of ANCX Common

that are exercised after the Effective Time to be approved for listing on
Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

Section 5.10 Indemnification.

  



  

(a) Following the Effective Time, the Continuing Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless any Person who has rights to
indemnification from ANCX or any of its Subsidiaries (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") (in any capacity), against all costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgements, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to, the fact that such Person is or was a
director or officer of ANCX and pertaining to matters, acts or
omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a "
_Claim_ "), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the same extent and on the same conditions as such Person was
entitled to indemnification pursuant to applicable Law and ANCX's
Organizational Documents or any ANCX Subsidiary's Organizational Documents,
as the case may be, or any indemnification agreements to which an Indemnified
Party is a party as in effect on the date of this Agreement, subject, in call
cases, to the provisions in this _Section 5.10_.

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
_Section 5.10(a)_ , upon learning of any such Claim, shall promptly notify
the Continuing Corporation thereof. In the event of any such Claim (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) the Continuing Corporation
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Continuing
Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, (ii) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and
(iii) the Continuing Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent; provided, further, that the
Continuing Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) UBSH, or ANCX in consultation with UBSH, shall at or prior to
the Effective Time, purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy on terms
and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current
policies of the directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
ANCX with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective Time,
covering, without limitation, the Merger; provided, however, that the
aggregate cost of such "tail" policy shall in no event exceed three hundred
percent (300%) of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by
ANCX for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the premium necessary
to purchase such "tail" prepaid policy exceeds the Maximum Amount, UBSH will
obtain the maximum amount of that insurance obtainable for a premium equal to
the Maximum Amount.

  



  

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her respective heirs and
legal representatives. The rights to indemnification and the other rights
provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or
otherwise.

assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger, transfers
all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other Person or
engages in any similar transaction, then in each case, the Continuing
Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Continuing Corporation will expressly assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.10_. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent
required by any agreement previously entered into by ANCX in connection with
a merger, acquisition or other business combination, the provisions of this
_Section 5.10_ shall apply to directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries
of predecessor entities previously acquired by ANCX.

its Subsidiaries who is involuntarily terminated by the Continuing Corporation
on and after the Effective Time and through the first anniversary after the

provided by UBSH, by such employee.

all leases with respect to real or personal property used by it or any
Subsidiary. With respect to the leases disclosed in _Section 5.12_ of ANCX's

efforts to obtain all consents necessary or appropriate to transfer and
assign, as of the Effective Time, all right, title and interest of ANCX and

to the extent requested by UBSH, and ANCX agrees to enter into such amendments
to this Agreement as UBSH may reasonably request in order to give effect to
such restructuring; provided, that no such change shall (i) alter or change
the Exchange Ratio or Merger Consideration, (ii) adversely affect the Tax
treatment of the Merger with respect to ANCX's shareholders or
(iii) materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in a timely manner. The parties hereto agree to reflect

use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall
have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the
Exchange Ratio or the Merger Consideration, in a manner adverse to such party

Section 5.15 Takeover Laws.

  



  

Neither party hereto shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Laws
to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereto shall take all
necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover
Laws now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Laws may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party
hereto and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary and legally
permissible so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Takeover Laws

directors or affiliates (or combination thereof) relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall give UBSH the opportunity to consult
in the defense of any shareholder litigation relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall give UBSH the right to review and
comment on all filings or responses to be made by ANCX in connection with any
such litigation, and the right to consult on the defense or settlement with
respect to any such shareholder litigation, and ANCX will in good faith take
such comments into account. In addition, no such settlement by ANCX shall be
agreed to without UBSH's prior written consent, and no such consent of UBSH
shall be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b) UBSH shall give ANCX prompt notice of any action, arbitration,
audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued,

following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the Continuing
Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

After the date of this Agreement, each party hereto shall coordinate with the
other regarding the declaration of any dividends in respect of ANCX
Common Stock (to the extent permitted to be made under this Agreement) and

obtained), (B) by UBSH pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ or (C) by UBSH or ANCX
pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ and (iii) prior to the date that is 12 months
after the date of such termination ANCX enters into an Acquisition Agreement
or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether
or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then ANCX
shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such Acquisition Agreement
or the date of consummation of such transaction, pay UBSH a fee equal to
$25,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by UBSH.

  



  

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by UBSH pursuant to
_Section 7.1(e)_ or by ANCX pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ , then ANCX shall,
on the date of termination, pay UBSH the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by UBSH.

  



  

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by ANCX pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_ , then UBSH shall, on the date of termination, pay ANCX the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts designated by ANCX.

  



  

(d) The payment of the Termination Fee by ANCX or UBSH pursuant to
this _Section 7.4_ , as applicable, constitutes liquidated damages and not a
penalty, and shall be the sole monetary remedy of ANCX or UBSH, as the case
may be, in the event of termination of this Agreement specified in such
section. Each of UBSH and ANCX acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.4_  are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, UBSH and ANCX,
respectively, would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if UBSH or
ANCX, as applicable, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this
_Section 7.4_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, UBSH or ANCX, as
applicable, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the other
party for the fee set forth in this _Section 7.4_ , UBSH or ANCX, as
applicable, shall pay to the other party its fees and expenses (including
attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of the fee at a rate per annum equal to the prime
rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was
required to be made.

  



  

Section 7.5 Expenses.

  



  

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense,
including filing, registration and application fees, printing and
mailing fees, and fees and expenses of its own financial or other
consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel, except that the
costs and expenses of printing the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement and the filing fees payable to the SEC in connection with the
Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement shall be borne equally by
UBSH and ANCX.

 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

Section 8.1 Entire Agreement.

  



  

This Agreement, including the Disclosure Letters, Exhibits and the other
documents and instruments referred to herein, together with the
Confidentiality Agreements, the Bank Merger Agreement and the Affiliate
Agreements contains the entire agreement between UBSH and ANCX with
respect to the Merger and the related transactions and supersedes all prior
arrangements or understandings with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 8.2 Waiver and Amendment.

  



  

Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived and the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party may be
extended in writing at any time by the party that is, or whose shareholders
are, entitled to the benefits thereof; provided, that after the UBSH
Shareholder Approval or ANCX Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there may
not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any extension or
waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof that requires further approval
under applicable Law. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver
or extension or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure to comply
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition. This Agreement may be
amended or supplemented by a written instrument duly executed by the parties
hereto at any time, whether before or after the later of the date of the UBSH
Shareholders Meeting or the ANCX Shareholders Meeting; provided, that after
obtaining the UBSH Shareholder Approval or ANCX Shareholder Approval,
there shall be made no amendment that requires further approval by such
shareholders.

  



  

Section 8.3 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

  



  

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to the conflict of Law or
choice of Law principles thereof that might otherwise refer construction or
interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive Law of another
jurisdiction. Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in
respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in any state or federal court
located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and, solely in connection with
claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the
subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any
such action or proceeding in such courts, (iii) waives any objection that such
courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party
and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section
8.4_.

Section 8.5 Counterparts; Facsimile Signature.

  



  

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, but such counterparts together shall constitute one and
the same agreement. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument
entered into in connection with this Agreement may be executed by facsimile
signature or other electronic transmission signature and such signature shall
constitute an original for all purposes. No party to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise the use of facsimile machine or email delivery of a 
".pdf." format data file to deliver a signature to any such agreement or
instrument or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party forever waives any such defense.

  



  

Section 8.6 Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries.

  



  

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations shall
be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law
or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. Any
purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns. Except as specifically provided in _Section 5.10_ ,
this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein)
is not intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto or
their respective successors, any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
Knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the
parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the
date of this Agreement or as of any other date. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof to the contrary, no consent, approval or agreement of any
third party beneficiary will be required to amend, modify to waive any
provision of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.7 Specific Performance.

  



  

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and,
accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties'
obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby
further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at Law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post
security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

Section 8.8 Waiver of Jury Trial.

  



  

Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under
this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues,
and therefore each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation,
directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and
acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver, (ii) it understands and has considered the implications of
this waiver, (iii) it makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each party has
been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this  _Section 8.8_.

  



  

Section 8.9 Severability.

  



  

In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable any other provisions hereof. Any
provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or
degree shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable. Further, the parties agree that a court of competent
jurisdiction may reform any provision of this Agreement held invalid or
unenforceable so as to reflect the intended agreement of the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 8.10 Captions; Articles and Sections.

  



  

The captions contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
are not part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to
particular Articles or Sections shall mean and refer to the referenced
Articles and Sections of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.11 Interpretations.

  



  

(a) Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein
shall be construed or resolved against any party hereto, whether under
any rule of construction or otherwise. No party hereto shall be considered
the draftsman. The parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement has been
reviewed, negotiated and accepted by all parties and their attorneys and,
unless otherwise defined herein, the words used shall be construed and

(b) Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to include
the plural, and any plural term the singular. Whenever the words "include," 
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed
followed by the words "without limitation." The word "or" shall not be
exclusive and "any" means "any and all." The words "hereby," "herein,"
"hereof," "hereunder" and similar terms refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any specific Section. All pronouns and any variations thereof refer
to the masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the context may
require. If a word or phrase is defined, the other grammatical forms of
such word or phrase have a corresponding meaning. A reference to a document,
agreement or instrument also refers to all addenda, exhibits or schedules
thereto. A reference to any "copy" or "copies" of a document, agreement or
instrument means a copy or copies that are complete and correct. Unless
otherwise specified in this Agreement, all accounting terms used in
this Agreement will be interpreted, and all accounting determinations under
this Agreement will be made, in accordance with GAAP. Any capitalized terms
used in any schedule, Exhibit or Disclosure Letter but not otherwise defined
therein shall have the meaning set forth in this Agreement. All references to
"dollars" or "$" in this Agreement are to United States dollars. All
references to "the transactions contemplated by this Agreement" (or similar
phrases) include the transactions provided for in this Agreement, including
the Merger and the Bank Merger. Any contract or Law defined or referred to
herein or in any contract that is referred to herein means such contract or
Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of contracts) by waiver or consent and (in the case of Law) by
succession of comparable successor Law and references to all attachments
thereto and instruments incorporated therein. The term "made available" means
any document or other information that was (a) provided (whether by physical
or electronic delivery) by one party or its representatives to the other party
or its representatives at least two business days prior to the date hereof,
(b) included in the virtual data room (on a continuation basis without
subsequent modification) of a party at least two business days prior to the
date hereof, or (c) filed by a party with the SEC and publicly available on
EDGAR at least two business days prior to the date hereof.
