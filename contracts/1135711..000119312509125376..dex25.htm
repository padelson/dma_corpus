DURING THE PERIOD COMMENCING THROUGH AND INCLUDING [INSERT DATE 12 MONTHS
FOLLOWING CLOSING DATE] (THE " _RESTRICTED PERIOD_ "), THE HOLDER OF THE

OR INDIRECTLY, (I) OFFER, PLEDGE, SELL, CONTRACT TO SELL, SELL ANY OPTION OR
CONTRACT TO PURCHASE, PURCHASE ANY OPTION OR CONTRACT TO SELL, GRANT ANY
OPTION, RIGHT OR WARRANT FOR THE SALE OF, MAKE ANY SHORT SALE OR OTHERWISE
DISPOSE OF OR TRANSFER ANY SHARES, OR (II) ENTER INTO ANY SWAP OR ANY OTHER

INDIRECTLY, THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCE OF OWNERSHIP OF ANY SHARES, WHETHER ANY
SUCH SWAP OR TRANSACTION IS TO BE SETTLED BY DELIVERY OF COMMON STOCK OF
NETLOGIC MICROSYSTEMS, INC. OR OTHER SECURITIES, IN CASH OR OTHERWISE.
THE FOREGOING RESTRICTION IS EXPRESSLY INTENDED TO PRECLUDE THE HOLDER OF THE
SHARES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY HEDGING OR OTHER TRANSACTION WHICH IS DESIGNED TO
OR WHICH REASONABLY COULD BE EXPECTED TO LEAD TO OR RESULT IN A SALE OR  



 

13  DISPOSITION OF ANY OF SUCH SHARES EVEN IF SUCH SECURITIES WOULD BE DISPOSED
OF BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE HOLDER OF THE SHARES. SUCH PROHIBITED HEDGING
OR OTHER TRANSACTION WOULD INCLUDE WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SHORT SALE OR ANY
PURCHASE, SALE OR GRANT OF ANY RIGHT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY PUT OR
CALL OPTION) WITH RESPECT TO ANY SHARES OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY SECURITY THAT
INCLUDES, RELATES TO, OR DERIVES ANY SIGNIFICANT PART OF ITS VALUE FROM SUCH;
_PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , _THAT_ THE TERMS OF CLAUSES (I) AND (II) SHALL NOT

The transfer agent of the Parent will deliver such shares in compliance with
this Section 2.1(g). The terms and provisions of this Section 2.1(g) are
specific terms of the Merger, and the approval and adoption of this Agreement
and approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders shall constitute
approval by such Company Stockholders, as specific terms of the Merger,
and the irrevocable agreement of such Company Stockholders to be bound by

2.2 _Dissenting Holders_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
eligible under the DGCL to exercise appraisal or dissenters rights and are
held by a holder who (a) has not voted in favor of this Agreement and the
Merger, (b) has exercised and perfected appraisal or dissenters rights for
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and (c) has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters rights
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive such consideration for Company Stock set forth
in Section 2.1(a)(i), but rather such shares shall be converted into the right
to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.2(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal and dissenters rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the consideration for
such shares set forth in Section 2.1(a)(i), without interest, less the
withholdable portion of the Escrow Amount with respect to such shares (whether
or not actually withheld) as set forth in Sections 2.1(a) and 2.6, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such Dissenting Shares.

(c) The Company shall (i) comply with the requirement of Section 262 of the

the Company and (iii) give Parent the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not make any payment or settlement
offer with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in
writing to such payment or settlement offer.



 

14 (d) Any consideration paid by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
to any Person with respect to any Excess Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL in excess of the consideration that would otherwise be
payable pursuant to Section 2 for each such Excess Dissenting Share (such
consideration, unless determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a
court, being subject to the written approval of the Representative, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and all
interest, costs, expenses and fees as incurred by the Company, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation in connection with the exercise of all rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Excess Dissenting Shares shall
constitute "Damages" for purposes of this Agreement, and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall, without limiting any other
rights, be entitled to recover such Damages from the Indemnification Funds.

2.3 _Options_. The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action
such that each outstanding and unexercised Option shall be terminated one
Business Day prior to the Closing Date (unless exercised contingent on the
Closing prior to such termination date), including but not limited to, not
less than 30 days prior to the Closing Date, sending notice thereof to every
holder of an Option.

2.4 _Warrants_. The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action
such that each outstanding and unexercised Warrant shall be terminated one

holder of a Warrant.

(other than the holders of Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled to receive on
the Earn-Out Distribution Date, consideration equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing the Nominal Earn-Out Consideration, if any, by the Applicable
Closing Price (the " _Earn-Out Consideration_ "). The Nominal Earn-Out
Consideration shall be calculated as follows:

(i) In the event Net Revenue during the Earn-Out Period is less than or equal
to 75% of the Net Revenue Target then the Nominal Earn-Out Consideration shall
be $0;

(ii) In the event Net Revenue during the Earn-out Period is greater than 75%
of the Net Revenue Target then the Nominal Earn-Out Consideration shall be the
Adjusted Percentage Number multiplied by $2.4 million. " _Adjusted Percentage
Number_ " shall mean a number equal to: (A) the difference of (I) the
percentage up to 100% that Net Revenue is of the Net Revenue Target and (II)
75% multiplied by (B) 100\. The Earn-Out Consideration shall be payable in
cash and shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.5(b) with
each share of Parent Common Stock being deemed to have a per share value equal
to the Applicable Closing Price; and

(iii) In the event Net Revenue during the Earn-out Period is greater than 90%
of the Net Revenue Target then the Nominal Earn-Out Consideration shall be as
determined in (ii) above _plus_ an additional amount equal to the Additional
Adjusted Percentage Number multiplied by $1.0 million. " _Additional Adjusted
Percentage Number_ " shall mean a number equal to: (A) the difference of (I)
the percentage up to 100% that Net Revenue is of the Net Revenue Target and
(II) 90% multiplied by (B) 100\. The Earn-Out Consideration shall be payable
in cash and shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.5(b) with
each share of Parent Common Stock being deemed to have a per share value equal
to the Applicable Closing Price.

For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the total amount of
Nominal Earn-Out Consideration exceed $70,000,000 payable as set forth in
Section 2.5(b) in cash and shares of Parent Common Stock with each share of
Parent Common Stock being deemed to have a per share value equal to the
Applicable Closing Price.



 

15 (b) Within 90 days following the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " _Earn-Out Distribution Date_ "), Parent shall deposit the Earn-Out
Consideration with the "Paying Agent" (as defined in Section 2.8(a)) which
shall be promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days) distributed by the Paying Agent to Company Stockholders (other than
holders of Dissenting Shares) in such amounts as calculated in accordance with
this Section 2.5(b). On such date, Company Stockholders (other than holders of
Dissenting Shares) shall receive for each share of Company Stock held by such
Company Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) in the case
of each share of Company Common Stock, cash in the amount of the Earn-Out Per
Share Common Consideration, and (ii) in the case of Company Preferred Stock,

Series A Preferred Stock, the Earn-Out Per Share Series A Consideration, (B)
in the case of each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Earn-Out Per
Share Series B-1 Consideration, (C) in the case of each share of Series B-2
Preferred Stock, the Earn-Out Per Share Series B-2 Consideration, (D) in the
case of Series C Preferred Stock, the Earn-Out Per Share Series C
Consideration and (E) in the case of Series D Preferred Stock, the Earn-Out
Per Share Series D Consideration (in each case, subject to Section 2.5(e)):

(i) in the event the Applicable Total Consideration is _less than_ the Total
Preference Amount, then:

(A) " _Total Common Consideration_ " shall mean the greater of (a) Common
Merger Consideration or (b)(i) Applicable Total Consideration, multiplied by
(ii) Common Preference Amount, which product shall be divided by (iii) Total
Preference Amount to which quotient shall be added (iv) the Applicable
Directed Common Consideration;

(B) " _Total Series A Consideration_ " shall mean the (a) Applicable Total
Consideration, multiplied by (b) Series A Preference Amount, which product

by the Fully Diluted Total Share Number to which quotient shall be added (C)
the Applicable Directed Common Consideration;



 

16 (B) " _Total Series A Consideration_ " shall mean (a) the Series A Preference
Amount plus (b)(i) the Applicable Total Consideration minus Total Preference

with Company Organizational Documents shall be adjusted to decrease the Total
Series D Consideration to an amount that equals $31,250,000, but in no event
shall the conversion price used to calculate the Fully Diluted Series D
Preferred Share Number be increased above $1.58 such that in no event shall

elects, to divest, discontinue, adopt a licensing model for, or second source

Out Consideration. In lieu of any fractional shares, the fractional amount of

or caused to be delivered by Parent to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as escrow agent
(the " _Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to the provisions of the escrow agreement in
the form attached as _Exhibit C_  hereto, subject to any amendments to such

the Escrow Agent, and shall (i) provide Parent with recourse against the
Escrow Consideration held in escrow by the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Funds_

The escrow described above shall commence on the Effective Time and terminate

period between the Effective Time and the Expiration Date shall be referred to
as the " _Escrow Period_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that the portion of the
Escrow Funds, which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, subject to the
objection of the Representative and the subsequent resolution of the matter in
the manner provided in Section 14.9, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied
claims specified in any Officers Certificate theretofore delivered to the
Escrow Agent and the Representative prior to termination of the Escrow Period
with respect to Damages incurred or litigation pending prior to expiration of
the Escrow Period, shall remain in the foregoing escrow until such claims have
been finally resolved, or, if earlier, until released in accordance with
Section 14.9 below, provided further that the Expense Consideration shall
remain in the foregoing escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
The terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby are specific terms of the Merger, and the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Indemnifying
Securityholders shall constitute approval by such Indemnifying
Securityholders, as specific terms of the Merger, and the irrevocable
agreement of such Indemnifying Securityholders to be bound by and comply with,
the Escrow Agreement and all of the arrangements and provisions of this
Agreement relating thereto, including, without limitation, the deposit of the
Escrow Amount into escrow, the indemnification obligations set forth in
Section 14 hereof and the appointment and sole authority to act on behalf of
the Indemnifying Securityholders of the Representative, as provided for
herein and in the Escrow Agreement.



 

19 (b) Parent Indemnifying Parties shall have no recourse to the Expense

the Representative pursuant to Section 14.6 and the Escrow Agreement.

2.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as
paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the Company
Stockholders (i) the Total Initial Common Consideration plus (ii) the Total
Initial Preferred Consideration, less the Escrow Amount.

(b) _Surrender Procedures_.

(i) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall mail to each Company
Stockholder (A) a letter of transmittal substantially in the form agreed upon
by Parent, the Representative and the Company, which shall contain all
covenants, conditions and restrictions made applicable to the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued under this Agreement or any of the exhibits hereto
(including those contained in Sections 14 and 15 of this Agreement) and the
Company Stockholder recipients receipt of such shares under this Agreement or
any of the exhibits hereto (" _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which
shall include, among other things, the agreement of the surrendering Company
Stockholders to the appointment of the Representative, the indemnification of
the Representative, the payment of expenses of the Representative pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and a release of claims as set forth in Section
16 of this Agreement and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of certificate(s) representing all of the shares of Company Stock held by such
Company Stockholder in exchange for the Stock Closing Payment and the right
to receive future payment of any Earn-Out Consideration. The payment of the
Stock Closing Payment and future Earn-Out Consideration with respect to each
such certificate is conditioned upon (1) the execution and delivery of the
Letter of Transmittal, (2) a representation by the Company Stockholder that
such Company Stockholder owns all right, title and interest to all shares of
Company Stock registered in the name of such Company Stockholder and (3) the
delivery of such certificates related thereto (or an affidavit of loss with
respect to such certificates). As soon as practicable after receipt by the
Paying Agent of such certificate(s), properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer, for cancellation (or affidavit, as applicable), together
with such duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the Paying Agent shall, in
exchange therefor, pay to such Company Stockholder the Stock Closing
Payment payable in respect of the shares of Company Stock formerly
represented by the certificate(s) surrendered, but without any interest earned
thereon, and the certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of any portion of the applicable Stock Closing Payment is to be made
to a person, firm, entity, partnership, association or any business
organization or division thereof (each a " _Person_ ") other than the Person
in whose name the surrendered certificate(s) are registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment (A) shall have
paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of those
amounts to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate(s)
surrendered, and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Parent that
such Tax has been paid, or (B) shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Parent that such Tax is not applicable. From and after the
Effective Time, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8(b),
each certificate formerly representing shares of Company Stock (other than any
Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed to represent for all purposes only the
right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration and Earn-Out
Consideration as provided pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof, if any, in
respect of such shares of Company Stock formerly represented thereby in
accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein. In
connection with the surrender of the certificates representing shares of
Company stock each Company Stockholder will be required to acknowledge that
all the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor will
be subject to the Lock-Up Restrictions.



 

20 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares
of Company Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of certificates formerly evidencing ownership of the shares
of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise
provided for herein or by Applicable Law. After the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall cancel and exchange, as
provided in this Section 2, any presented certificate representing shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the Earn-Out
Distribution Date, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including, without
limitation, any earnings received with respect thereto) that had been made
available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to Company
Stockholders and thereafter such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to
look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements), upon due surrender
of their certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock or rights
to purchase such shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a certificate formerly representing shares of
Company Stock for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from payment of any
amounts (or any portion thereof) payable pursuant to this Agreement to, or on
behalf of, any Company Stockholder or any other Person, and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from payment of any
Company Stockholders pro rata portion of the Escrow Amount (or any portion
thereof) otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company
Stockholder, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other Legal Requirement. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Stockholder
or such other Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificate(s)
which formerly represented shares of Company Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an affidavit of that fact
by the Company Stockholder thereof in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and the execution and delivery of a letter of transmittal in accordance with
Section 2.8(b), Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay such Company
Stockholder the applicable Stock Closing Payment as provided in this Section
2; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its reasonable
discretion, acting in good faith, and as a condition precedent to issuing
such instruction to the Paying Agent, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and a bond in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



 

21 (g) _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of this Section 2.8 shall also apply
to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the
obligations of Parent under this Section 2.8 shall commence on the date of
loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange for such shares the applicable amounts provided in Section 2\.

2.9 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to
all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time are and will remain fully
authorized in the name of the Company and Merger Sub or otherwise to take, and
shall take, all such action.

SECTION 3\. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the statements in this
Section 3 are true, complete and correct as of the date hereof and will be

Code or Section 4001(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "). Each of the arrangements set forth on Section

employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code and associated with any Company Employee Plan is expressly
identified as such on Section 3.13(c) of the Disclosure Schedule and has been

there is no determination letter but the Qualified Plan is based upon a master
and prototype or volume submitter form, the sponsor of such form has received
a current advisory opinion as to the form upon which the Company is entitled
to rely under applicable Internal Revenue Service procedures) and nothing has
occurred as to each which has resulted or is likely to result in the

Service to preserve such qualification.

concerning any Company Employee Plan or, to the Companys Knowledge, any
fiduciary or service provider thereof and, to the Companys Knowledge, there
is no basis for any such legal action, proceeding or investigation;

(ii) no liability (contingent or otherwise) to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") or any Multiemployer Plan has been incurred by the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate (other than insurance premiums satisfied in due

of an ERISA Affiliate, which is subject to Title IV of ERISA;



 

34 (iv) no Company Employee Plan nor, to the Companys Knowledge, any person who
is a party in interest in respect of an Company Employee Plan within the
meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, has engaged in a prohibited transaction
which could subject the Company or any Subsidiary directly or indirectly to
liability under Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code;

bound) to modify or terminate any Company Employee Plan or adopt any
arrangement or program which, once established, would come within the
definition of an Company Employee Plan;

(vii) each Company Employee Plan is terminable at the sole discretion of the
sponsor thereof and without penalty or cost (other than routine
administrative costs), subject only to such constraints as may be imposed by
applicable law; and

under any Company Employee Plan, arising out of the improper treatment of any
service provider as a consultant or independent contractor and not as an
employee, or vice-versa.

which a separate fund of assets is or is required to be maintained, full and
timely payment has been made of all amounts required of the Company or any
Subsidiary, under the terms of each such Company Employee Plan or applicable
law (determined without regard to any waiver of legally applicable funding
requirements), as applied through the Closing Date. The fair market value of
the assets of each such Company Employee Plan, as of the end of the most
recently ended plan year of that Company Employee Plan, equals or exceeded the
present value of all benefits liabilities under that Company Employee Plan.
None of the assets of any Company Employee Plan include any capital stock or
other securities issued by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

(f) _Effect of Transactions_. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein will not, by itself or
in combination with any other event (regardless of whether that other event
has or will occur), result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise) becoming due from or under any Company Employee Plan to any current
or former director, officer, consultant or employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary or result in the vesting, acceleration of payment or increases in
the amount of any benefit payable to or in respect of any such current or
former director, officer, consultant or employee. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is party to, or otherwise obligated under, any contract, agreement,
plan or arrangement (other than this Agreement) covering any person that,
individually or collectively, but without giving effect to the payment of
Transition Shares or Retention Shares or any other payment by Parent, could
give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by Parent,
the Company or any Subsidiary by reason of Section 280G of the Code or that
could be subject to Section 4999 of the Code. The Companys Code Section 280G
Disclosure memorandum will be accurate and complete as of the date it is

than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock determined on the date
of grant of such Option (and as of any later modification thereof within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code). Each plan, program, arrangement or
agreement that constitutes in any part a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code is identified as such on
Section 3.13(i) of the Disclosure Schedule. Since December 31, 2004 and
through December 31, 2008, each plan, program, arrangement or agreement

Parent RSU awarded by Parent and by one share for every two Option Shares
awarded by Parent. Any and all Incentive Shares will be granted by the board

proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, using all reasonable efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to
cause the conditions precedent set forth in Sections 7, 8 and 9 to be
satisfied; (ii) obtaining or making all consents, approvals, orders or
authorizations of, or registrations, declarations or filings with
any Governmental Authority and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to avoid any Action by any Governmental Authority; (iii) the
obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties (provided,
that the parties will discuss in good faith procedures to pursue third party
consents with respect to the Merger); (iv) to lift any restraint, injunction
or other legal bar to the Merger and (v) the executing or delivering of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its board of directors
shall, if any takeover statute or similar Legal Requirement is or becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, use all reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize, to the extent reasonably possible, the effect of any such Legal
Requirement on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

6.4 _Advise of Changes_. From the date hereof and continuing until the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall promptly advise the other party in
writing to the extent it has Knowledge of (a) any event or circumstance that
would reasonably be expected to result in any representation or warranty made
by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by Merger Sub) in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (b) the failure by it
(and, in the case of Parent, by Merger Sub) to comply in any material
respect with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement prior to
the Effective Time, (c) any change or event having, or which is reasonably
likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as applicable (d) any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
no such notification will be deemed to prevent or cure any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, amend or supplement any Section of the Disclosure Schedule, or
otherwise disclose an exception to, or affect in any manner, the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties or the Indemnifying Securityholders under this Agreement. 

6.5 _Cooperation_. Subject to compliance with Applicable Law, from the date
hereof until the Effective Time, the officers of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries and other personnel of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries

54 6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Unless Parent requests otherwise by written notice to Company prior to the
Closing Date, effective immediately prior to the Closing, the Company will
terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to qualify as a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code and
effective immediately prior to the Closing, no employee shall have any right
to contribute any amounts to any Company Employee Plan intended to qualify as
a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code. At
the request of Parent, the Company will provide Parent with evidence that such
Company Employee Plans have been terminated effective immediately prior to
the Closing pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the board of directors of
the Company. In addition, at the request of Parent, the Company will terminate
any and all other Company Employee Plans, including any group health or
dental plans or programs, effective either immediately prior to the Closing or
thereafter as specified by Parent and, at the request of Parent, the Company
will provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plans have been
so terminated pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the board of directors
of the Company. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance
of terminating such Company Employee Plans as Parent may reasonably require.

(b) If the Company is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any
agreement that under certain circumstances could obligate it to make any
payments, that will not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code if the
stockholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code are not
satisfied (" _Potential 280G Benefits_ "), then the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such stockholder approval as
promptly as is practicable after the date hereof and in any event prior to the
Closing Date.

(c) Parent shall provide to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
become employees of Parent or remain employees of the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiary following the Closing Date employee benefits and
compensation plans and programs that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. Parent shall
take such actions as are necessary to provide each employee of the Company
and its subsidiaries with credit for service for the Company and its
subsidiaries for purposes of vesting, eligibility, participation and level of
benefits (but not benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan) under any
benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or an affiliate thereof in which such
employee participates on or after the Closing in the same manner as if such
service had been service for the Parent or its affiliate; provided, however,
that no such credit shall be required to the extent that such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(d) Subject to the requirements of Applicable Law, Parent shall take
reasonable actions intended to cause the group health plan maintained by the
Parent or an affiliate thereof, and applicable insurance carriers, third party
administrators and any other third parties, to the extent such group health
plan is made available to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries,
to (i) waive any evidence of insurability requirements, waiting periods, and
any limitations as to preexisting medical conditions under the group health
plan applicable to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and their
spouses and eligible dependents (but only to the extent that such preexisting
condition limitations did not apply or were satisfied under the group health
plan maintained by the Company or its affiliates prior to the Closing) and
(ii) provide employees of the Company and its subsidiaries with credit, for
the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, for the amount of any out-of
pocket expenses and copayments or deductible expenses that are incurred by
them during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs under a group
health plan maintained by the Parent or any of its affiliates.



 

55 (e) Parent shall take reasonable actions intended to cause a retirement plan
maintained by it or one of its affiliates that is qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code to accept direct and indirect rollover distributions, on
behalf of the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who continue
employment following the Closing, of account balances maintained by them
under any Company Employee Plan intended to qualify as a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, including promissory
notes evidencing outstanding plan loans (if any).

6.7 _Company Option Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all action necessary such that the Company Option Plan is terminated
effective as of the Effective Time.

6.8 _Calculation of Estimated Transaction Expenses_. On or prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with a certificate executed by
the Companys Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer with the
Companys calculation of, and supporting documentation for, the Estimated
Transaction Expenses.

6.9 _Non-Solicitation_.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries and affiliates shall not,
directly or indirectly, through any officer, director,
employee, representative or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(and it shall use reasonable efforts to cause such officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents not to, directly or indirectly), (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or proposals that
constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below) or (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions
concerning, or provide any non-public information to any person or entity
relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at
any time prior to the date the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained (the
" _Applicable Period_ "), the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to
do so is reasonably likely to result in a breach of fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under Applicable Law, the Company may and may permit and
authorize its Subsidiaries and representatives to, in response to an
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 6.9(c)), which was not
solicited by it and which did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 6.9(a), and subject to compliance with Section 6.9(b), (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person
making such an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
containing terms substantially similar to the terms (including with respect to
standstill or other provisions) of the Confidentiality Agreement and
permitting the disclosure contemplated by this Section 6.9 and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person making such
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_
" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 25% or more
of the net revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 25% or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall, except as set forth in this Section 6.9, withdraw, amend or modify, or
propose to any person outside the Company to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the
Companys board of directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the
 



 

56  Merger (any such withdrawal, amendment, modification or proposal, a "
_Change of Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time prior to the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of
the Company may effect a Change of Recommendation, _provided_ , that the
Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so is reasonably likely to
result in a breach of fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in addition to the condition in
the immediately preceding clause, the following additional conditions must
first be satisfied prior to effecting a Change of Recommendation in response
to a Superior Proposal (as defined below): the Company has (A) provided to
Parent three business days prior written notice which shall state (1) that
is has received a Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of
the Superior Proposal, subject to the provisions of any existing non-
disclosure agreement as of the date hereof, a copy of the current draft of
each negotiated agreement relative thereto, and the identity of the Person or
group making the Superior Proposal, and (3) that the Companys board of
directors intends to effect a Change of Recommendation due to the existence
of a Superior Proposal; (B) provided to Parent a copy of all written materials
made available to the Person or group making the Superior Proposal in
connection with such Superior Proposal to the extent that such materials have
not previously been provided to Parent; (C) during such three business day
period, if requested by Parent, engaged in, and caused its financial and legal
advisors to have engaged in, good faith negotiations with respect to any
amendments to this Agreement; and (D) Parent shall not have, during such
three day business period, made, and not withdrawn, a bona fide written offer
(that will be binding on the Parent assuming due authorization and execution
thereof by the Company) that the Companys board of directors has in good
faith determined results in the Superior Proposal no longer being a Superior
Proposal. Nothing in this Section 6.9 shall be deemed to affect any obligation
of the Company under this Agreement. 

(c) If Parent makes a counterproposal to a Superior Proposal, the Company
shall consider and cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate on its
behalf in good faith with respect to the terms of such counterproposal. For
purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited
bona fide, written proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or
indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction, for consideration consisting of cash
and/or securities, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the shares
of Company Common Stock then outstanding or all or substantially all the
assets of the Company and otherwise on terms which the board of directors of
the Company determines in its good faith judgment after receiving the advice
of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
its outside counsel, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of
such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend
the terms of this Agreement) to be more favorable from a financial point of
view to the Company and the Companys equityholders than the terms of this
Agreement and to have a reasonable likelihood of closing, taking into account
all financial, legal, regulatory, timing and other aspect of such proposal
(including the need for and contingency for financing).

(d) The Company agrees that as of the date of this Agreement, it shall, and it
shall cause its Subsidiaries and affiliates (and their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives and agents) to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any person (other than Parent or its representatives) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Subject to the
restrictions, terms and conditions of any non-disclosure agreement entered
into on or before the date hereof, the Company shall notify Parent promptly
(but no later than 48 hours) after receipt by the Company (or its advisors) of
any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books
or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any person or entity
that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that (i) such notice to Parent shall
be made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable  



 

57  detail the identity of the offeror and the terms and conditions of such
proposal, inquiry or contact; (ii) the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event within 48 hours) of
all material developments and the status of any Acquisition Proposal, any
negotiations or discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any person or entity that is considering making, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) the Company shall, subject to the terms of any
nondisclosure agreement entered into prior to the date hereof, provide Parent
with copies of all documents received from or delivered or sent to any person
or entity that is considering making or has made an Acquisition Proposal to
the extent that such documents relate to or are furnished in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal and have not previously been provided to Parent; and
(iv) the Company will promptly provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company provided to any other party making an Acquisition
Proposal which was not previously provided to Parent.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.9 shall prohibit the Company from
making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the board of directors of the Company, after consultation with
its outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as
specifically permitted in this Section 6.9, neither the Company nor its board
of directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose to
any person outside the Company to withdraw or modify, its position with
respect to this Agreement or the Merger or approve or recommend, or propose to
any person outside the Company to approve or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal.

(f) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions of this Section 6.9 and Section 6.11(c) were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Either
Party shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or injunctions as a remedy
and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security, to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Section 6.9 and Section 6.11(c) and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which such Person may be entitled at law or in equity.

6.10 _Company Stockholders  Consent_.

(a) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
submit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder, including
the Merger to all of the Company Stockholders for approval and adoption by
written consent as provided by the DGCL and the Companys Organizational
Documents pursuant to the Company Solicitation Statement and Notice of
Appraisal Rights which form of written consent and Company Solicitation
Statement and Notice of Appraisal Rights shall include information regarding
the Company, the terms of the Merger, this Agreement, and the recommendation
of the Company Board to adopt and approve this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and approve the Merger, and a
statement that the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously
determined that the terms of the Merger and this Agreement are fair to and in
the best interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders; and _provided_
that the Company shall not solicit the written consent or vote of any Company
Preferred Stockholder who is not an "accredited investor" unless and until
Parent shall have provided to such Preferred Stockholder the type of
information required to be furnished under Rule 502 of Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act and determined to Parents reasonable
satisfaction that such Preferred Stockholder meets the conditions under Rule
506(b)(2) of Regulation D, and in no event prior to the date on which
Parent mails the Proxy Statement to the Parent Stockholders.



 

58 (b) Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain
the approval or consent of as many of the Company Stockholders as possible as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof.

6.11 _Parent Special Meeting; Proxy Statement_.

(a) Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
execution of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement
in preliminary form (provided that the Company and their counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, and
each amendment or supplement thereto, prior to its filing with the SEC), and
Parent shall use its best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. If at any time
prior to the Parents Special Meeting there shall occur any event that should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, Parent
shall promptly prepare and mail to the Parent Stockholders such an amendment
or supplement. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Parent Stockholders as promptly as practicable
after filing with the SEC.

with Parent to prepare the Proxy Statement (and each amendment or supplement
thereto) and agrees to provide all information about the Company and its
Subsidiaries to Parent that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, including, but not limited to, (i) all financial
statements and related pro forma financial statements, that comply with the
requirements of Regulation S-X under the rules and regulations of the SEC (as
interpreted by the staff of the SEC) for financial statements that would be
required to be included in Proxy Statement (together with customary reports
and "comfort" letters of the Companys independent public accountants) and
(ii) shall provide and make reasonably available upon reasonable notice the
senior management employees of the Company to discuss the materials prepared
and delivered pursuant to this Section 6.11(b). Company agrees, as to itself
and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the
date of mailing to the Company Stockholders and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

(c) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take all
action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders (the " _Parent Special Meeting_ ") and (ii) cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Parents stockholders, in each case, as soon as
practicable following communication from the SEC that (A) the Proxy Statement
will not be reviewed or (B) there are no further comments on the Proxy
Statement and authorized its mailing; _provided_ that Parent shall not be
obligated to proceed with such meeting during the pendency of any order or
injunction by a Governmental Authority prohibiting the solicitation of proxies
pursuant to the Proxy Statement. Neither the board of directors of Parent nor
any committee thereof shall, withdraw, amend or modify, or propose to any
person outside Parent to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the
Company or the Company Stockholders, the approval or recommendation by
Parents board of directors or any such committee of the matters set forth in
the Proxy Statement (" _Parent Change of Recommendation_ ").

(d) The Company shall cooperate with Parent in connection with
the preparation of related pro forma financial statements, in each case that
comply with (i) the requirements of Regulation S-X under the rules and
regulations of the SEC (as interpreted by the staff of the SEC) for  



 

59  financial statements that would be required to be included in Proxy
Statement (together with customary reports and "comfort" letters of
the Companys independent public accountants) and (ii) shall provide and make
reasonably available upon reasonable notice the senior management employees of
the Company to discuss the materials prepared and delivered pursuant to
this Section 6.11(d).

6.12 _Indemnification of Company Board of Directors and Officers; Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnification Obligations_. During the period ending six years after
the Effective Time, Parent will directly provide all rights to
indemnification existing as of the Closing Date in favor of the Companys
officers and directors still serving as of such date, (the " _Indemnified D
andOs_"), and shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation fulfills its
obligations to the Indemnified DandOs, pursuant to the terms of the Company
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof and each
indemnification agreement in effect between the Company and the Indemnified
DandOs, subject to all defenses available to the Company or Parent, as the case
may be. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation from liability set forth in the Company Organizational Documents
on the date of this Agreement, and, during the period commencing on the
earliest date on which the Merger Sub purchases the Company Stock and ending
on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, such provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified DandO.

(b) _Insurance_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an
extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance coverage that shall provide the Indemnified
DandOs with coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less than
the existing coverage and have other terms not materially less favorable to
the Indemnified DandOs than the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company, so long as the
aggregate cost is less than $100,000.

6.13 _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. The Company shall obtain the
resignations of all officers and members of the board of directors of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries effective as of the Effective Time.

6.14 _Employee Retention Consideration_. Parent shall provide the following
additional consideration in order to retain certain of the employees of the
Company up to and after the Effective Time (" _Employee Retention
Consideration_ "):

(a) Parent shall issue $8,650,000 in shares of Parent Common Stock (the "
_Retention Shares_ "), with each share of Parent Common Stock deemed to have a
per share value equal to the Applicable Closing Price, less applicable
withholding taxes. The Retention Shares shall be allocated and distributed by
the Surviving Corporation to certain employees of the Company to further
incentivize them to remain as employees of the Company through
the consummation of the Merger and will be issued as set forth on _Schedule
6.14(a)_ , immediately following the Closing Date.

(b) After the Closing Date, Parent shall issue $10,000,000 in shares of Parent
Common Stock (" _Transition Shares_ "), which Transition Shares shall be in
the form of Parent RSUs to be awarded to incentivize certain individuals who
are employees of the Company immediately prior to the Closing and who become
employees of Parent or remain employees of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries following the Merger to remain so employed for one year after the
Effective Date. The total number of Transition Shares shall be determined by
dividing $10,000,000 by the Applicable Closing Price. Fifty Percent of the
Transition Shares shall vest and be issued on the six month anniversary of the
Closing Date and the remaining fifty percent of the Transition Shares shall
vest and be issued on the  



 

60  twelve month anniversary of the Closing Date. Allocation of the Transition
Shares shall be as set forth on 
_Schedule 6.14(b)(i)_. All Transition Shares will be granted by the board of
directors of Parent within 60 days after the Closing Date and be subject to an
agreement between the recipient and Parent (" _Transition Share Agreement_ ").
Each Transition Share Agreement shall provide that the vesting schedule for
the Transition Shares shall accelerate in the event the recipient is
terminated by Parent without Cause prior to twelve months following the
Closing Date, provided, that the Transition Share Agreement for the employees
listed in Schedule 6.14(b)(ii) shall provide that the vesting schedule for the
Transition Shares shall also accelerate in the event the recipient is
terminated by Involuntary Termination. Each transitional employee described in
this Section 6.14(b) shall receive an employment agreement providing for (i)
the payment, upon the completion or earlier termination of such employees
services to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, of the same severance amount,
if any, set forth in such employees employment agreement with the Company
existing on the date hereof and (ii) the extension of COBRA and unemployment
benefits following the termination of such services that are consistent with
what the employee would have been eligible to receive following his or her
termination as a Company employee on the Effective Date.

(c) On or before the Closing Date, Parent shall file a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form with respect
to all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Employee Retention
Consideration and the Incentive Shares.

6.15 _Interim Financing_. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent will issue the Company a short term bridge loan in the original
principal amount of $15,000,000 to be used by the Company solely for working
capital to fund its operations in the ordinary course of business. The bridge
loan will be evidenced by a fixed term interest bearing, secured note due and
payable in full 18 months following the Closing Date pursuant to a Note and
Security Agreement (the " _Note Agreement_ ") substantially in the form
attached as _Exhibit D_.

6.16 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agree
to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify, and will not take any actions which to their Knowledge could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company each agree to use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to merge the Surviving Corporation
with and into a limited liability company wholly-owned by Parent in a manner
that will enable the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section
368(a) of the Code in the event that Parent, in Parents sole discretion,
determines that such action is reasonably necessary or advisable so as to
enable the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the
Code. Following the Effective Time, Parent and Surviving Corporation each
agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Merger to qualify, and will not take any actions which could cause any of the
statements or representations in their respective letters delivered in
connection with the opinion referred to in Section 9.6 to be untrue, incorrect
or incomplete or, to their Knowledge, could reasonably be expected to prevent
the Merger from qualifying, as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the
Code. For the avoidance of doubt, following the Merger, Parent may merge the
Surviving Corporation with and into Parent, a business entity wholly owned by
Parent which is disregarded as an entity separate from Parent for federal
income tax purposes (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(b)(1)(i)(A)), or an entity that is classified as a corporation for
federal income tax purposes and is treated as controlled by Parent for
purposes of Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Code, by means of a statutory merger
or consolidation, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 
1.368-2(b)(1)(ii); provided, that Parent shall not be obligated to merge
the Surviving Corporation with any entity after the Merger.



 

61 (b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto hereby
adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of and described in Section 1313(a)(1) of
the Code.

SECTION 7\. _Conditions Precedent to the Obligations of Each Party to Effect
the Merger_. The respective obligations of each party under this Agreement to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be
subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions:

7.1  _Stockholder Approval_. Parent shall have obtained the Parent
Stockholder Approval, and the Company shall have obtained the Requisite
Stockholder Approval.

7.2 _Antitrust Approvals_. All approvals, authorizations or clearances
required under any applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to any Antitrust
Filings shall have been obtained and all requirements thereunder shall have
been satisfied.

injunction or other order or judgment preventing the consummation of the
Merger shall have been issued by any court of competent jurisdiction and
remain in effect.

SECTION 8\. _Additional Conditions Precedent to the Obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub_. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be
subject to satisfaction at or prior to the Closing Date of each of the
following conditions:

8.1 _Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

(a) Each of the representations and warranties of the Company in this
Agreement, shall be true, complete and correct in all material respects as of
the Effective Time as though such representation and warranty had been made at
the Effective Time (except for changes in capitalization permitted under this
Agreement, changes resulting from the Companys conduct of business in the
ordinary course in compliance with the Agreement and the ancillary agreements
and those representations and warranties which address matters only as of a
particular date shall remain true, complete and correct as of such date);
provided, however, (i) that the condition set forth in this Section 8.1(a)
shall be deemed satisfied unless the effect of all such failures of

(a) any fraud, misrepresentation or breach or failure of any representation or
warranty made by the Company or the Representative in this Agreement or in
any officers certificate to be true and correct in all respects as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date in each case, as such representation or
warranty would read if all qualifications as to knowledge and
materiality, including, without limitation, each reference to the defined
term Company Material Adverse Effect, were deleted therefrom solely for the
purposes of calculating Damages but not for the purposes of determining
whether or not any misrepresentation, breach or failure of any representation
or warranty has occurred;

(b) any post-closing claim for material breach or non-fulfillment of any
covenant or agreement made or to be performed by the Company prior to the

otherwise included in the Transaction Expenses; and

(e) regardless of any disclosure on the Disclosure Schedule, any claim related
to the items disclosed as (3) or (4) under Section 3.14(h) of the Disclosure
Schedule (each a " _Special Matter_ " and collectively, the " _Special
Matters_ ").

The Parent Indemnified Parties shall have a right, solely to the extent the
aggregate amount of Claims made against the Escrow during the Escrow Period
exceeds the total amount of the Escrow Funds, to withhold from, and place
into the Escrow, any required payments of the Earn-Out Consideration, which
would otherwise have been made to the Indemnifying Securityholders, up to a
maximum of 10% of such earned payments for any and all Damages arising from
or related to any of the above clauses (a)-(b). Any such amounts deposited
shall be treated as Escrow Funds pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and this
Section 14\. For purposes of this Section 14, each share of Parent Common
Stock deemed to have a per share value equal to the Applicable Closing Price,
the amounts otherwise payable as Earn-Out Consideration that are deposited

together with the Escrow Funds, the " _Indemnification Funds_."



 

70 14.2 _Indemnification of Parent Indemnified Parties_. Subject to the
limitations on liability set forth in Section 14.3(a) below, each
Indemnifying Securityholder who accepts payment of the applicable portion of
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement pursuant to Section 2
shall be deemed to have agreed, and hereby agrees, to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, severally and not jointly, the Parent Indemnified Parties from
and against, and such Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be
compensated and reimbursed for, any and all Damages arising from or related
to any misrepresentation or breach or failure of Section 3.4(b) as it related
to such Indemnifying Securityholders Company Stock.

14.3 _Limitations of Liability_.

(a) Except in the case of (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation, or (ii)
a breach of the representation made in Section 3.4(b), the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties for Parent Claims against any
Indemnifying Securityholder for any other breach or obligation hereunder shall
be recourse against the Indemnification Funds, relating specifically to shares
held by that Indemnifying Securityholder. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, claims by Parent in excess of such Indemnification Funds with
respect to breach of the representation made in Section 3.4(b) may only be
brought against the Indemnifying Securityholder who held, or claimed to have
held, the Company securities that gave rise to such Claim. Claims by Parent in
excess of such Indemnification Funds as a result of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation may only be brought against the Indemnifying Securityholder
who committed such fraud or made such intentional misrepresentations.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, indemnification shall
not be available, and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not otherwise have
recourse against the Indemnification Funds, for Damages with respect to Parent
Claims made pursuant to Section 14.1 (other than Parent Claims made pursuant
to 14.1(e) for which a Parent Claim can be made pursuant to the limitations
set forth in Section 14.3(c)) unless the total of all Damages in respect of
such Parent Claims shall exceed $500,000 (the " _Threshold_ ") in the
aggregate, whereupon the total amount of all such Damages (including Damages
included within such amount) shall be recoverable in accordance with the terms
hereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, indemnification shall not be
available, and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not otherwise have
recourse against the Indemnification Funds, for Damages with respect to Parent
Claims made pursuant to Section 14.1(e) (" _Special Claims_ ") unless the
total of all Damages with respect to such Parent Claim shall in the case of
each Special Matter exceed $250,000 (the " _Special Deductible_ "). In the
event Damages with respect to a Special Claim exceed the Special Deductible,
Parent shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 14,
subject to the limitations otherwise set forth herein, for 50% of any amount
of Damages in excess of the Special Deductible.

(d) Without limiting the rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties under the
Escrow Agreement or against the Indemnification Funds, the liability of each
Indemnifying Securityholder for indemnification hereunder in all events shall
be several and not joint, and in no event will an Indemnifying Securityholder
have liability under this Agreement for an amount in excess of the aggregate
amount of Merger Consideration and Earn-Out Consideration received by
such Indemnifying Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement, including,
without duplication, the Indemnification Funds contributed by such
Indemnifying Securityholder.

(e) In the event (i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.1(d) or (ii) Parent fails to complete the Merger notwithstanding the
satisfaction of all closing conditions under Section 7 and Section 8, and
Parent is not then entitled to terminate this Agreement  



 

71  pursuant to Section 12.1, the Company shall be entitled to all remedies
available at law or equity. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
any amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations hereunder
shall be paid without duplication, and in no event shall any Parent
Indemnified Parties be indemnified under different provisions of this
Agreement for the same Damages. 

(f) In the event (i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.1(e) or (ii) the Company fails to complete the Merger notwithstanding the
satisfaction of all closing conditions under Section 7 and Section 8, and the
Company is not then entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.1, Parent shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or equity.

(g) Any Damages as to which indemnification provided for in Section 14
may apply shall be determined net of any actual cash recovery actually
received by a Parent Indemnified Party with respect to insurance or
contributions from third parties specifically with respect to the specific
matter for which indemnification is sought, less any current or prospective
costs associated with receiving such recovery. This Section 14.3(f) shall not
imply and shall not be construed to imply any obligation on the part of any
Person to seek or pursue any such recovery and the failure to seek or pursue
any such recovery shall not be a defense to any indemnification obligation
hereunder. Parent shall attempt to mitigate Damages that have resulted to an
Indemnification claim hereunder, _provided_ , however, that nothing herein
shall require Parent to take any action that is not commercially reasonable.

The terms and conditions of this Section 14 constitute essential terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Merger, and approval of this Agreement by
the Company Stockholders shall constitute the express agreement of each
Indemnifying Securityholder with respect to the obligations of the Company
Stockholders pursuant to this Section 14\.

14.4 _Notification Certification of Claims_. If any Parent Claim has
occurred, an authorized officer or an authorized representative of the Parent
Indemnified Party may provide the Representative with a written certificate
signed by such officer or representative (an " _Officer s Certificate_")
describing with reasonable specificity, and to the extent known by the
applicable Parent Indemnified Party, the nature and amount of such Parent
Claim. Any such Officers Certificate shall be delivered during the
Escrow Period.

14.5 _Third Party Actions_. In the event any Action is instituted against a
Parent Indemnified Party which involves or appears reasonably likely to
involve a Parent Claim for which indemnification may be sought, Parent will,
promptly after receipt of notice of any such Action, provide written
notification to the Representative of the commencement thereof. The failure
to so notify the Representative of the commencement of any such Action will
not relieve the Indemnifying Securityholders from liability in connection
therewith, except to the extent that such failure materially and
adversely affects the ability of the Indemnifying Securityholders to defend
their interests in such Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that such written
notice shall be effective only if delivered to the Representative within the
Escrow Period. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to assume
and control the defense or settlement of such Action, _provided_ _that_ ,
except with the consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of the Representative (or, in the event
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying
Securityholder as permitted by Section 14.3(a)), no settlement of any such
Action with third party claimants shall be determinative of the amount of
Damages relating to such matter. In the event that the Representative has
consented to any such settlement, the Indemnifying Securityholders shall have
no power or authority to object under any provision of this Section 14 to
the amount of any such Parent Claim against the Indemnity Funds, or against
the Indemnifying Securityholders directly as permitted by Section 14.3(a), as
the case may be, with respect to such settlement.



 

72 14.6 _Reimbursement and Indemnification for Stockholder Agent_. Subject to the
terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement and this Section 14, each
Indemnifying Securityholder who accepts payment of the applicable portion of
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to have
agreed, and hereby agrees, in addition to the Representatives entitlement to
reimbursement of Reimbursable Expenses pursuant to Section 15.6 of this
Agreement, that the Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement out of
the Expense Consideration for its reasonable fees, costs and expenses
incurred in the performance of its duties as Representative under this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, the right to employ financial and
legal advisors and other agents to undertake or to assist in the assessment,
litigation and/or settlement of any claims against the Escrow Fund. The
Representative is expressly authorized to rely upon the advice of such
advisors and agents. The Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless
by the Indemnifying Securityholders from and against any Damages that may be
incurred by the Representative arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or performance of the Representatives duties or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except as caused by
the Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct, including the
legal costs and expenses of defending such Representative against any claim or
liability in connection with the acceptance or performance of the
Representatives duties or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement. Parent shall not have any obligation or liability for
such expenses, costs or losses or for payment of any fees of the
Representative.

14.7 _Definition of Damages_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Damages_ " shall mean the amount of any loss, Tax, damage, deficiency,
liability, judgment, fine, penalty, diminution in value, cost or expense
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys, consultants
and experts fees and expenses) actually incurred, paid, accrued or sustained
by the Parent Indemnified Parties, whether or not involving an Action,
including, without limitation, any reasonable costs of defending any Actions
(unless such Action is found by a trier of fact to not be meritorious or
settled or withdrawn without any consideration from Parent) or properly
enforcing the Parent Indemnified Partys rights under this Agreement.

14.8 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Company Stockholders, the
Representative and Parent agree to treat (and cause their affiliates to
treat) any payments received pursuant to Section 14 as adjustments to the
Merger Consideration and Earn-Out Consideration for all Tax purposes, to the
maximum extent permitted by Legal Requirements.

14.9 _Transfer and Similar Taxes_. Any sales, use, transfer, gains, stamp,
duties, recording and similar Taxes incurred by the Company Stockholders as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by the Company Stockholders.

14.10 _Dispute Resolution_.

(a) Representative shall have 30 days after receipt (or deemed receipt) of the
Officers Certificate to deliver to Parent a written objection to all or any
part of the Officers Certificate, and such objection shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis of the Representatives objection to the Officers
Certificate and the amount of dispute. In case the Representative shall
deliver such written objection, Parent shall have 30 days to respond in a
written statement to the objection. If after such thirty (30) day period there
remains a dispute as to any claims, the Representative and Parent shall
attempt in good faith for 30 days to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Representative
and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and, if Parent has requested delivery of a
portion of the Escrow Funds, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall
distribute the appropriate portion of the Escrow Funds in accordance with  



 

73  the terms of the memorandum. If no such agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiation, either Parent or the Representative may, by written notice
to the other, demand arbitration of the matter, unless the amount of the
damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which
event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or
both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall
be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within 15 days after
such written notice is sent, Parent (on the one hand) and the Representative
(on the other hand) shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators
so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrators
as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall
be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and
notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold
payments from the Escrow Funds in accordance with such decision.
Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be conducted under the
commercial rules then in effect of the Judicial Arbitration and Meditation
Services (" _JAMS_ "). Any arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County,
California. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own
expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the JAMS, and
the expenses and costs, incurred by the prevailing party to the arbitration
(as determined by the arbitrator), but excluding attorneys fees and costs.

(b) Any dispute, controversy, or claim between Parent, on the one hand, and
the Indemnifying Securityholders or the Representative, on the other hand,
arising out of or relating to the provisions of this Agreement that relates
to the amount of Earn-Out Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.5(a)
that cannot be resolved by negotiations between Parent and the Representative
shall also be resolved through arbitration in the manner described
in subparagraph (a) of this Section 14.10. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 14.10, in the event of an alleged violation or breach
of this Agreement by a party (including, without limitation,
unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information), the other party may
seek temporary injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.

(other than the right to receive Merger Consideration payable to such

or (ii) pro-rata (in accordance with the allocations set forth in this

deliver this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and to carry out his, her or
its obligations hereunder and thereunder;



 

75 (ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Representative

the rights and remedies of creditors, and to general equity principles; and

(iii) The Escrow Agreement will be duly executed and delivered by the

the rights and remedies of creditors, and to general equity principles.

15.2 _Claims by Parent_.

(a) Upon receipt or notice of any Parent Claim pursuant to Section 14, the
Representative shall give prompt notice of the amount and details thereof (to
the extent of the information in his or her possession) to the Indemnifying
Securityholders.

(b) Prior to the settlement of any Parent Claim, or the release of any portion
of the Escrow Funds to any Parent Indemnified Party other than as a result of
a final arbitration award or court order, the proposed settlement must receive
the written approval of the Representative. The Representative shall have the
discretion to take such action as he, she or it shall determine to be in the
best interest of all of the Indemnifying Securityholders, including, without
limitation, authorizing the distribution to any Parent Indemnified Party of
any portion of the Escrow Funds; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in any event,
all Indemnifying Securityholders are treated in substantially the same manner
consistent with the allocation formula set forth in this Agreement.

15.3 _Notices_. Any notice given to the Representative will constitute notice
to each and all of the Indemnifying Securityholders at the time notice is
given to the Representative. Any action taken by, or notice or instruction
received from, the Representative will be deemed to be action by, or notice or
instruction from, each and all of the Indemnifying Securityholders, _provided_
, _however_ , notice with respect to any Parent Claims with respect to
Section 3.4(b) shall be given to the Indemnifying Securityholder to which
indemnification is sought. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation may, and the Escrow Agent will, disregard any notice or
instruction received from any one or more individual Indemnifying
Securityholders.

15.4 _Agreement of the Representative_. The Representative hereby agrees to
do such acts, and execute further documents, that in its discretion are
reasonable to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

15.5 _No Liability_. The Representative shall not incur any liability or
damages with respect to any action taken or suffered by it or omitted
hereunder as the Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise
of reasonable judgment and each Indemnifying Securityholder shall severally
indemnify and hold the Representative harmless, and shall bear its pro-rata
share (in accordance with the allocations set forth in this Agreement) of
such liability of damages. The Representative may, in all questions arising
hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel and for anything done, omitted or
suffered in good faith by the Representative based on such advice, the
Representative shall not be liable to anyone. The Representative undertakes to
perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this
Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this
Agreement against the Representative.



 

76 15.6 _Reimbursement of Expenses_. The Indemnifying Securityholders shall
severally, but not jointly, reimburse the Representative on a pro-rata basis
(in accordance with the allocations set forth in this Agreement) for any
reasonable expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part
of the Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of his duties hereunder, including reasonable expenses
incurred prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement in relation to the
engagement of the Representative and the review or execution of the
agreements related to such engagement (" _Representative Reimbursable
Expenses_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, the Representative shall have
the right to engage legal counsel and other professional advisers to assist
it in the administration of Representatives duties hereunder, and any and all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel and advisers shall be deemed
Representative Reimbursable Expenses. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Representative may be reimbursed for Representative Reimbursable Expenses
out of the Expense Consideration.

15.7  _Reliance on Representative_. Parent, Merger Sub, their respective
affiliates (including, without limitation, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on the
appointment of WP VIII Representative LLC as Representative and treat such
Representative as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Indemnifying
Securityholder and as having the duties, power and authority provided for in
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective affiliates (including, without limitation, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation) or the Escrow Agent shall be liable to any
Indemnifying Securityholder for any actions taken or omitted by them in
reliance upon any instructions, notice or other instruments delivered by the
Representative. Parent, Merger Sub, their respective affiliates (including,
without limitation, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) and
the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely at any time after receipt of any
such notice on the most recent notice so received. No resignation of the
Representative shall become effective unless at least 30 days prior written
notice of the replacement or resignation of such Representative shall be
provided to Parent and the Escrow Agent. If the Representative shall be unable
or unwilling to serve in such capacity, his, her or its successor who shall
serve and exercise the powers of the Representative hereunder shall be
appointed by a written instrument signed by Indemnifying Securityholders
holding a majority interest in the Escrow Funds. In addition, the Indemnifying
Securityholders may replace the Representative at any time upon approval of
the Indemnifying Securityholders holding a majority interest in the Escrow
Fund on the Closing Date.

SECTION 16\. _Release_. Each Company Stockholder who accepts payment of his,
her or its portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2 shall be
deemed to have, and hereby does, unconditionally release and forever discharge
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and any other subsidiary of Parent, including
their respective officers and directors, from (a) any and all obligations or
duties the Company might have to such Company Stockholder and (b) any and all
claims of liability, whether legal or equitable, of every kind and nature,
which such Company Stockholder ever had, now has or may claim against the
Company in each case arising out of facts or circumstances occurring at any
time on or prior to the date hereof; provided, however, that such release
shall exclude (i) those claims, liabilities, obligations and duties of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement, (ii) those claims,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to any
agreement with a Related Party that is not terminated pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement and (iii) to the extent applicable with respect to any
Company Stockholder who is a director, officer or employee of the Company, (A)
compensation not yet paid (including any amounts payable in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (B)
reimbursement for expenses incurred by any such Company Stockholder in the
ordinary course of his or her employment which are reimbursable under the
Companys expense reimbursement policies, (C) accrued vacation, subject to the
Companys policies on accrual and carryforward, and (D) any remaining
obligations of the Company to indemnify any officer or director. For the
purposes of this Section 16, each Company Stockholder hereby expressly waives
the benefits of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code which reads as
follows:

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE
RELEASE WHICH IF KNOWN TO HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.



 

77 The terms and provisions of this Section 16 are specific terms of the Merger,
and the approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by
the Company Stockholders shall constitute approval by such Company
Stockholders, as specific terms of the Merger, and the irrevocable agreement
of such Company Stockholders to be bound by such terms and provisions.

provisions set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of any of the
parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs
and permitted assigns of such party, whether or not so expressed. None of the
parties may assign, transfer or delegate any of their respective rights or
obligations under this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without
the consent in writing of the Company, Parent and the Representative
provided, that Parent and Merger Sub (including the Surviving Corporation)
may, without obtaining the prior written consent of Representative, assign any
of its rights, or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement to (a)
any affiliate of Parent, (b) any successor of such party by merger or

stock of such Person; provided that such assignment or delegation has been
made in good faith and has not been made for the purpose of avoiding or
frustrating any of the assigning or delegating partys obligations hereunder
and the assignee agrees to be subject to and bound by the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. The Representative shall execute such acknowledgements of
such assignments in such forms as Parent or Merger Sub (including the

17.3 _Interpretation_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of
interpretation apply:

(a) _Descriptive Headings_. The headings of the sections and paragraphs of
this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall
not be deemed to be part of this Agreement.

(b) _Calculation of Time Period_. When calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period is excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-
Business Day, the period in question ends on the next succeeding Business Day.



 

79 (c) _Currency_. Any reference in this Agreement to $ means U.S. dollars.

 

(d) _Section and Similar References_. Unless the context otherwise requires,
all references in this Agreement to any "Section," "Schedule" or "Exhibit"
are to the corresponding Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement.

(e) _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and have been represented by their
own legal counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, with the opportunity to seek advice as to their legal rights from
such counsel. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement is to be construed as jointly drafted by
the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof is to arise favoring
or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement or by reason of the extent to which any such provision is
inconsistent with any prior draft hereof.

17.4 _Counterparts; Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
and the exchange of signature pages to this Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by facsimile transmission or other electronic transmission
(including in the form of a PDF file) shall be sufficient to bind the parties
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

17.5 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained herein is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each of
parties rights and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, and any such invalidity,
illegality and unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction (so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party). If any court of
competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such court has the power to fashion and
enforce another provision (instead of the provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) that is valid, legal and enforceable and carries out
the intentions of the parties hereto under this Agreement and, in the event
that such court does not exercise such power, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith in an attempt to agree to another provision (instead
of the provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) that is valid,
legal and enforceable and carries out the parties intentions to the greatest
lawful extent under this Agreement.

17.6 _Third Parties_. Except as specifically set forth or referred to herein,
nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their
permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason
of this Agreement or any other certificate, document, instrument or agreement
executed in connection herewith nor be relied upon other than the parties
hereto and their permitted successors or assigns. The Parent Indemnified
Parties not party hereto are entitled to the rights and remedies of third
party beneficiaries with respect to Section 14\. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Representative shall be a third party beneficiary to all
sections of this Agreement in which it is not specifically designated as a
Party.

17.7 _Additional Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) an
individual will be deemed to have " _Knowledge_ " of a particular fact or
other matter if such individual is actually aware of such fact or other matter
or such individual could reasonably be expected to discover or otherwise
become  



 

80  aware of such fact or other matter after reasonable inquiry of such persons
direct reports, (b) with respect to Parent, "Knowledge" shall mean, with
respect to any matter in question, the actual Knowledge of any individual who
is currently serving as a director or officer of Parent after reasonable
inquiry of such persons direct reports, (c) with respect to the Company,
"Knowledge" shall mean, with respect to any matter in question, the actual
Knowledge of each of the "key employees" listed on _Schedule 8.4_ and the
following officers of the Company, after reasonable inquiry of such officers
direct reports: Behrooz Adbi, Steven Geiser, L. William Caraccio, Mark
Litvack, Nazar Zaidi, Steve Longoria, Greg Hoeppner, Mike Wodopian, Paula
Ewanich (provided, however, that the inclusion of L. William Caraccio in
this definition shall not be deemed a waiver or serve to compel the waiver of
any attorney-client, work product or other similar privilege with respect to
any dispute, claim or other matter related to or arising out of this
Agreement), (d) " _affiliate_ " and " _associate_ " have the meanings
ascribed to them under Rule 405 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities
Act and (e) " _Business Day_ " means any day of the year on which national
banking institutions in the State of California are open to the public for
conducting business and are not required or authorized to close and shall not
include Saturday.

17.8 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement, and all
matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the validity
hereof and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of California applicable
to contracts made and to be performed entirely in such state (without giving
effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof) except as to matters
pertaining to the Company as a Delaware corporation, and to the Company
Stockholders as stockholders of a Delaware corporation, which are governed by
the DGCL, and as to such matters, this Agreement shall be governed by the
DGCL. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any court of competent civil jurisdiction sitting in State of
California over any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereto hereby
irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard
and determined in such courts. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
such Action brought in such court or any claim that such Action brought in
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in such Action may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by any
applicable Legal Requirement. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
consents to process being served by any party to this Agreement in any Action
by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section
17.1 and consents to the exercise of jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of California over it and its properties with respect to any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or the enforcement of any rights under
this Agreement.

17.9 _Entire Agreement, Not Binding Until Executed_. This Agreement, including
the Disclosure Schedule, Schedules and Exhibits and the other agreements
referred to herein (including, without limitation, the Offer Package
Agreements and the Escrow Agreement), is complete, and all promises,
representations, understandings, warranties and agreements with reference to
the subject matter hereof, and all inducements to the making of this Agreement
relied upon by all the parties hereto, have been expressed herein or in such
Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits or such other agreements and
this Agreement, including such Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits and
such other agreements, supersede any prior understandings, negotiations,
agreements or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, to the
extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof, with
the exception of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms or provisions
hereof are binding upon or enforceable against any party hereto unless and
until the same is executed and delivered by all of the parties hereto.



 

81 17.10 _Amendments; No Waiver_. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each of the parties hereto, or, in the
case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective;
provided that, after approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by
the Company Stockholders and without their further approval, no amendment or
waiver shall reduce the amount or change the kind of consideration to be
received in exchange for any share of Company Stock. No course of dealing and
no failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right,
power or remedy conferred by this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof
or otherwise prejudice such partys rights, powers and remedies. The failure
of any of the parties to this Agreement to require the performance of a term
or obligation under this Agreement or the waiver by any of the parties
to this Agreement of any breach hereunder shall not prevent subsequent
enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent
breach hereunder. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy
conferred by this Agreement shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. No amendment to
any term or provision affecting the rights or obligations of the
Representative or any Indemnifying Securityholder should be permitted without
the Representatives written consent.
