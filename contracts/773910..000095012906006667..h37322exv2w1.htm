 _INTRODUCTION_  

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii) approved this Agreement. 

  

 WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.10 per share of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined in _Section 2.4(a)_ ) of the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in  _Section 1.2_) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 1.6(d)_), will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in _Section 1.6(b)_). 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement and incur the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved and Parent is entering into Voting Agreements with certain stockholders of the Company named therein, substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached to this Agreement (the " _Company Voting Agreements_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholders have agreed to vote the shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholders in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger provided for herein, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Company Voting Agreements. 

  

 In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, the Company Voting Agreements and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

 (a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (Central time) on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived on the Closing Date), at the offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP, 1111 Louisiana Street, 44th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002 unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing between Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 (b) On the Closing Date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the Company hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger, in accordance with the DGCL, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") (the time of such filing (or such later time as is specified in such Certificate of Merger as agreed in writing between Parent and the Company) being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

SECTION 1.3. _Effect of the Merger_ At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL (except
as provided herein). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the Company and the Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

SECTION 1.4. _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_ At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be amended to read in its entirety in the form of
_Exhibit B_ hereto, and, as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the bylaws
of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
amended to read in its entirety in the form of _Exhibit C_ hereto, and, as
so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

SECTION 1.5. _Directors and Officers_. 

   

 (a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or the election of their successors. The Company shall cause all directors of the Company to resign effective as of the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or the election of their successors. 

    ##### 

  

     

SECTION 1.6. _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any other holder of any shares of capital stock of Company Common
Stock: 

  

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $0.001 per share, and such shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the capital stock of Merger Sub shall represent all of the outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and any shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically by virtue of the Merger into the right to receive $61.00 in cash payable to the holder thereof (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and, subject to _Section 1.6(d)_, each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (d) _Shares of Company Common Stock of Dissenting Stockholders_. 

    

 (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all of the shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of Company Common Stock who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing an appraisal of the "fair value" of such Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and terminated and shall cease to have any rights with respect to Dissenting Shares other than such rights as are granted pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by holders of Company Common Stock who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights for an appraisal of such shares under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and terminated, as of the Effective Time, and shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.6(b)_, upon surrender in the manner provided in _Section 1.7_, of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock. 

   

 (ii) The Company shall give to Parent prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the 

   ##### 

  

   

Company in connection therewith. The Company and Parent shall jointly direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment of fair
market value under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
such demands, or offer to settle, or settle, any such demands. Any
amount payable to any holder of Company Common Stock exercising appraisal
rights shall be paid in accordance with the DGCL solely by the Surviving
Corporation out of its own funds. 

  

SECTION 1.7. _Exchange of Company Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive in trust the funds to which they shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ or _Section 1.8_. From time to time, Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation (as the case may be) cash in amounts and at times necessary for the prompt payment of the Merger Consideration or other cash amount (as the case may be) as provided in _Section 1.6(b)_ or _Section 1.8_, in the case of the Company Common Stock, upon surrender of certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock as provided herein or, in the case of Options if applicable, upon surrender of the written acknowledgements contemplated by _Section 1.8_. All interest earned on such funds shall be paid to Parent. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ "), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.6(b)_. Parent will use its reasonable efforts to cause provision to be made for holders of Company Certificates to procure in person immediately after the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions and to deliver in person immediately after the Effective Time such letter of transmittal and Company Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent (reasonably satisfactory to the Company), together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Company Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Company Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such 

     ##### 

  

    

Company Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.7(b)_, each
Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Company Certificate. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Transfer Books_. All cash paid upon the surrender of Company Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article 1_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Company Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for cash as provided in this _Article 1_. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Company Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their Company Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Company Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any payment pursuant to this _Article 1_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, the Merger Consideration in respect of such Company Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. As used in this Agreement, " _Governmental Authority_ " shall mean the United States federal, state, local or any foreign government, governmental, regulatory or administrative authority, agency, or commission or any court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body or entity. 

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Certificates evidencing Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Merger Consideration required pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit, which shall include indemnities and the posting of a bond which are reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the holder thereof with such assurances as the Paying Agent, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration may reasonably require of the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (f) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger any stock transfer taxes and such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

   

SECTION 1.8. _Options_. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any outstanding Option (hereinafter defined), whether vested or unvested, exercisable or unexercisable, each Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall immediately and fully vest, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in this  _Section 1.8_, each such Option shall terminate and be cancelled at the Effective Time and each holder of an Option will be entitled to receive from Parent, and shall receive, in settlement of each Option a Cash Amount. The " _Cash Amount_ " shall be equal to the net amount of (A) the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares subject to such Option, less (B) any applicable withholdings for Taxes. If the exercise price per share of any Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, the Cash Amount therefor shall be zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of the top 20 holders of Options (based on the aggregate "spread value" of such Options), payment of the Cash Amount is subject to written acknowledgement, in the form of _Exhibit D_ attached to this Agreement, that no further payment is due to such holder on account of any Option and all of such holders rights under such Options have terminated.

on which the Company Reserve Report was based for purposes of estimating the
oil and gas reserves set forth in the Company Reserve Report was accurate in
all material 

    ##### 

  

    

respects, and the Company has no knowledge of any material errors in the
assumptions and estimates provided to the Netherland, Sewell and Associates,

definitions contained in Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the
SEC. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Oil and Gas Interests_ " means

facilities (including tanks, tank batteries, pipelines, and
gathering systems), pumps, water plants, electric plants, gasoline and gas
processing plants, refineries, and other tangible personal property and
fixtures associated with, appurtenant to, or necessary for the operation of

means, with respect to any Person, crude oil, natural gas, casinghead gas,
condensate, sulphur, natural gas liquids, plant products and other liquid or
gaseous hydrocarbons produced in association therewith (including coalbed gas
and carbon dioxide), and all other minerals of every kind and character which
may be covered by or included in or attributable to any of the properties of
such Person or any of such Persons Subsidiaries. 

  

SECTION 2.18. _Hedging_. Except as set forth in Section 2.18 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company SEC Reports accurately summarize the
outstanding Hydrocarbon and financial Hedging positions attributable to the
production and marketing of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
the date reflected therein, and there have been no material changes since the
date thereof to the date hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Hedge_
" means a derivative transaction within the coverage of SFAS No. 133,
including any swap transaction, option, warrant, forward purchase or
sale transaction, futures transaction, cap transaction, floor transaction or
collar transaction relating to one or more currencies, commodities, bonds,
equity securities, loans, interest rates, credit-related events or conditions

transactions, including collateralized mortgage obligations or other similar
instruments or any debt or equity instruments evidencing or embedding any
such types of transactions, and any related credit support, collateral,
transportation or other similar arrangements related to such transactions. 

  

SECTION 2.19. _Properties_. All major items of operating equipment owned or
leased by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (i) are, in the
aggregate, in a state of repair so as to be adequate in all material respects
for reasonably prudent operations in the areas in which 

    ##### 

  

    

they are operated and (ii) are adequate, together with all other properties
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to comply in all material
respects with the requirements of all applicable contracts, including sales
contracts. Except for goods and other property sold, used or otherwise
disposed of since December 31, 2005 in the ordinary course of business, as of
the date hereof, the Company has good and defensible title (as defined below)
for oil and gas properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in
the Companys December 31, 2005 financial statements included in the
Company SEC Reports, and pipelines and gas gathering and processing systems,
free and clear of any Lien, except: (a) Liens reflected in the balance sheet
of the Company as of December 31, 2005 included in the Company SEC Reports;
(b) Liens for current taxes not yet due and payable or for taxes that the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is contesting in good faith through
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established
in accordance with GAAP; (c) Liens associated with obligations reflected in
the Company Reserve Report and (d) such imperfections of title, easements and
Liens that would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All leases and other
agreements pursuant to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
leases or otherwise acquires or obtains operating rights affecting any real
or personal property are valid and effective, except where the failure to be
valid or effective would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; and
there is not, under any such leases, any existing or prospective default or
event of default or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that
would have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has not received
any material advance, take-or-pay or other similar payments that
entitle purchasers of production to receive deliveries of Hydrocarbons
without paying therefor, and, to the knowledge of the Company, on a net,
company-wide basis, the Company is neither underproduced nor overproduced, in
either case to any material extent, under gas balancing or similar
arrangements. For purposes of this Agreement, " _good and defensible title_ "
means title that is free from reasonable doubt to the end that a prudent
person engaged in the business of purchasing and owning, developing, and
operating producing oil and gas properties in the geographical areas in which
they are located, with knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing,
would be willing to accept the same.

Company Subsidiary has received any notice of termination or cancellation
with respect to any such policy

any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any agreement or
other arrangement that materially limits or otherwise restricts the Company

Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries or any
successor 

    #####

case of such non-competition agreements, are set forth in Section 2.21 of the
Company Disclosure Letter) entered into in connection with prospect reviews
and similar arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in breach or default
under any material contract (as defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K
of the SEC) to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or any
contract set forth in Section 2.21 of the Company Disclosure Letter (which
includes each material joint venture Hydrocarbon exploratory agreement

thereof would otherwise be applicable will occur as a result of the execution
or delivery of this Agreement, the Company Voting Agreements or the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Company Voting Agreements and (b) the Rights Agreement will
terminate and the Company Rights will expire immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Rights Agreement, as so amended, has not been further
amended or modified. True and complete copies of the Rights Agreement and all
such amendments have been filed with the SEC, or, if not, provided to

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB 

   

 Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company that: 

 

SECTION 3.1. _Organization_. Parent and each of the Subsidiaries of Parent
(including Merger Sub) (the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ ") is a corporation,
limited liability company or partnership duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept
of good standing) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and
has all requisite power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. Parent and each of
the Parent Subsidiaries is duly qualified and/or licensed, as may
be required, and in good standing in each of the jurisdictions (with respect
to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character of the property
owned, leased or used by it makes such qualification and/or
licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement; without limiting the 

     ##### 

 

    

generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, will furnish to each other the information
relating to the party furnishing such information required by the Exchange Act
to be set forth in the Proxy Statement, and Company and its counsel shall be
given the opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts, after consultation with the other parties hereto, to respond
promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.
The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to, or
correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement will be made by the Company, without the approval of Parent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ that with
respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in
the Proxy Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to
information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition
or results of operations, or this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company, in connection with a
Change in the Company Recommendation (as defined in _Section 5.8(a)_ ) or a
Non-Takeover-Related Change of Recommendation (as defined in _Section 5.1(d)_
), may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by
reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment (as defined below) to disclose
such a change, and in such event, this right of approval shall apply only
with respect to information relating to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby, or the other party or its business, financial condition

supplement to the Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by reference)
to the extent it contains (i) a Change in the Company Recommendation or a
Non-Takeover-Related Change of Recommendation, (ii) a statement of
the reasons of the Board of Directors of the Company for making such Change
in the Company Recommendation or Non-Takeover-Related Change of
Recommendation and (iii) additional information reasonably related to the
foregoing. The Company will advise Parent promptly after it receives notice
of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 

   

 (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, and in accordance with the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable law, establish a record date (which will be as soon as practicable after the date hereof) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") solely for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement regardless of whether the Board of Directors of the Company determines at any time that this Agreement or the Merger is no longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the 

    ##### 

  

    

Company reject this Agreement or the Merger. Once the Company Stockholders
Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (other than (i) for the absence
of a quorum or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which it believes in good
faith is necessary under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting); _provided_ that if the Company
Stockholders Meeting is delayed to a date after the Termination Date (as
defined in _Section 7.1(b)_) as a result of either (i) or (ii) above, then
the Termination Date shall be extended to the fifth Business Day after such
date. The Board of Directors of the Company shall declare that this Agreement
and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and
recommend that this Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the Company
and include in the Proxy Statement a copy of such recommendations; 
_provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw, modify or
change such recommendation if but only if (i) it has complied with all of its
obligations under _Section 5.8_ and believes in good faith, taking into
account all relevant factors, including those set forth in the definition of
Superior Proposal in _Section 5.8(b)_, and after receiving the advice of the
Companys financial advisors and outside counsel, that a Superior Proposal has
been made and (ii) it has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that withdrawal, modification or change of such
recommendation is required by the Board of Directors to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and shall take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders required by
applicable law to effect the Merger. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 5.1_ to the contrary, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal or communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the receipt by the Company of a Superior Proposal, unless Parent terminates this Agreement under _Section 7.1(f)_, then prior to the termination of this Agreement taking effect under _Section 7.1(f)_, the Company shall be obligated to comply with _Section 5.1(b)_ and the other terms of this Agreement, including by holding the Company Stockholders Meeting, except that the Company shall not be required to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting if the Company has terminated this Agreement under _Section 7.1(g)_ and paid to Parent the Termination Fee contemplated thereby. If (x) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal, (y) the Companys Board of Directors withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in a manner adverse to Parent or resolves to do any of the foregoing or the Companys Board of Directors recommends to the Companys stockholders any Takeover Proposal or resolves to do so, and (z) the Required Company Stockholder Vote is not secured at such meeting, then at such time this Agreement shall be deemed to be terminated by the Company under _Section 7.1(f)_. The Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee as provided in _Section 7.3_. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Companys Board of Directors from failing to make, or from withdrawing or modifying, its recommendation that 

    ##### 

  

    

this Agreement be adopted by the Companys stockholders in circumstances
where no Takeover Proposal is or has been outstanding (a " _Non-Takeover-
Related Change of Recommendation_ ") if the Companys Board of
Directors determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that it is required to take such action in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. 

   

 (e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that Parent would be damaged irreparably if any provision of this _Section 5.1_ is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Company agrees that Parent will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this _Section 5.1_ and to enforce specifically this Agreement and its terms and provisions in any action or proceeding instituted in the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with _Section 8.4_, in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled, at law or in equity. 

  

SECTION 5.2. _Employee Benefit Matters_. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have the rights and obligations
described in this _Section 5.2_ regarding the individuals who were employees
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Acquired
Employees_ "). 

   

 (a) _Employment_. All Acquired Employees shall be employed solely on an "at will" basis, except to the extent required by the provisions of written employment contracts or as required by applicable law. An Acquired Employee whose employment is terminated ceases immediately to be an "Acquired Employee" for purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Benefit Plans_. The Surviving Corporation shall assume the Company Employee Benefit Plans as of the Effective Time and operate such plans in accordance with their respective terms, and the Company shall take any steps necessary to permit such assumption. Subject to the obligations set forth in _Section 5.2(d)_, Acquired Employees shall continue after the Effective Time to participate in such assumed Company Employee Benefit Plans and at such time as determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation with Parents approval, Acquired Employees shall participate in Parents compensation, severance, bonus, stock option and other incentive plans for which they are eligible pursuant to the terms and conditions of such plans, or in similar plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation, in each case consistent with the participation offered to Parents employees holding similar positions. Each such plan shall grant credit to each Acquired Employee for all service prior to the Effective Time with the Company (including any predecessors) to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of vesting and eligibility (including eligibility for participation and levels of benefits) but, except as explicitly set forth in the terms of any Parent or Surviving Corporation plan, not for (i) purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit "pension plan" as defined in ERISA section 3(2) (including nonqualified defined benefit pension plans) or (ii) benefits under retiree medical plans. No Acquired Employee shall be simultaneously covered under similar employee benefit plans of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and of the Company. Nothing in this _Section 5.2_ shall restrict in any manner the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any assumed Company Employee Benefit Plan or to modify any compensation arrangement of any Acquired Employee for any reason at any time (in each case subject to the provisions of any Company Employee Benefit Plan). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Group Health Plans_. On and after the Effective Time occurs, any group health plan established or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall, with respect to any eligible Acquired Employee or, as applicable, a family member of an eligible Acquired Employee, (i) waive any waiting period, (ii) waive any exclusion or limitation for preexisting conditions which were covered under any group health plan maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, (iii) grant credit (for purposes of annual deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket limits) for any covered claims incurred or payments made prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) accept rollovers of the health flexible spending account and dependent care accounts of eligible Acquired Employees. 

   

 (d) _Compensation_. During the one-year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each Acquired Employee for so long as the Acquired Employee remains so employed, compensation and employee benefits that, with respect to each employee, are substantially as favorable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to such employee under the Company Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time (including payment by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation of bonuses in respect of 2006 performance that are substantially as favorable as the bonuses that would have been paid to the Acquired Employee under the applicable Company Employee Benefit Plan). 

   

 (e) _Severance_. During the one year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each Acquired Employee with severance payments and severance benefits, if any, contemplated by Schedule 5.2(e).

   ##### 

  

   

information or conduct of such additional discussions (A) such third party
shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement in customary form that is
no less favorable to the Company, including any standstill provisions
included therein, and no less restrictive as the Company Confidentiality
Agreement (and containing additional provisions that expressly permit the
Company to comply with the provisions of this _Section 5.8_)), and (B) the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that it is required to do so
in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

stockholders (in their former capacities as Company stockholders) cease to
own at least 80% of the voting securities of the ultimate parent
entity resulting from such transaction or sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company, which in any such case is on terms that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel), taking into
account all relevant factors, including any conditions to such Takeover
Proposal, the timing of the closing thereof, the risk of nonconsummation, any
required governmental or other consents, filings and approvals, (A) would, if
consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated

the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (B) is
reasonably likely to be financed and otherwise completed without undue delay

    ##### 

  

    

such request and the planned date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, with
half calendar days being rounded down;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, with
respect to any Bona Fide Takeover Proposal made within four calendar days
(or, with respect to a Bona Fide Takeover Proposal described in clause (A)
above, one calendar day) of the planned date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, the Companys Board of Directors will be deemed to have made a
Recommendation Against a Takeover Proposal for all purposes under this
Agreement (including Section 7.3(c)). 

   

 (d) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this _Section 5.8_, the Company shall promptly (and in any event, within 24 hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, any request for information with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which could result in a Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the same and shall promptly provide Parent with a copy of any written request or Takeover Proposal or other document relating to a Takeover Proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide any confidential information to Parent (i) with respect to the business, assets or operations of the person, entity or group making the Takeover Proposal, or (ii) to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it may not provide all or part of such confidential information in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, provided that the Companys Board of Directors may not claim that a condition in a Takeover Proposal that such confidential information not be provided to Parent is a basis for refusing to provide such information because doing so would breach such fiduciary standard. 

  

SECTION 5.9. _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification by the Company now existing in favor of each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who acts as a fiduciary under any of the Company Employee Benefit Plans (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof, copies of which have been provided to Parent, including provisions relating to the advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit, shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

any rights to indemnification of any Indemnified Party referred to in clause
(a) above. Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights of the DandO Indemnitees, unless
such modification is required by law. In the event notice of any claim for
indemnification or reimbursement of expenses under this _Section 5.9(b)_
shall have been made within the ten-year period referred to the first
sentence of this _Section 5.9(b)_ and such claim has not been finally
resolved by the expiration of such ten-year period, the obligations set forth

Parent shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the Companys DandO Insurance by obtaining and causing to be maintained a six-year "tail" policy of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms no less advantageous to the Companys directors and officers currently covered by the DandO Insurance than the Companys existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this _Section 5.9(c)_ for so long as it remains in effect for such six-year period. 

   

 (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies without the consent of such affected DandO Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the 

    ##### 

  

    

DandO Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_ , each of whom may enforce the provisions
of this _Section 5.9_). 

   

 (e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may, be shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.
