purchasers of production to receive deliveries of Hydrocarbons without paying therefor, and, to the

overproduced, in either case to any material extent, under gas balancing or similar arrangements.
For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<B><I>good and defensible title</I></B>&#148; means title that is free from
reasonable doubt to the end that a prudent person engaged in the business of purchasing and owning,
developing, and operating producing oil and gas properties in the geographical areas in which they
are located, with knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing, would be willing to accept
the same.
