the failure to be so qualified would have a material adverse effect upon the condition (financial

Documents), properties or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one
enterprise, or impair the Company&#146;s ability to perform on a timely basis its obligations under this
Agreement (any of the foregoing, a &#147;Material Adverse Effect&#148;), and no proceeding has been
instituted in any such jurisdiction, revoking, limiting or curtailing, or seeking to revoke, limit
or curtail, such power and authority or qualification.

of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The Shares
being purchased by the Buyer hereunder will, upon issuance and payment therefor pursuant to the
terms hereof, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid and nonassessable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 6%">3.3. <U>Non-Contravention</U>. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the sale of
the Shares, the fulfillment of the terms of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not (A)&nbsp;conflict with or constitute a violation of, or default (with the

agreement or instrument, an &#147;Exchange Act Exhibit&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;the charter, by-laws or other

to the Company or any subsidiary or their respective properties, except in the case of clauses (i)
and (iii)&nbsp;for any such conflicts, violations or defaults which do not have or would be reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (B)&nbsp;result in the creation or imposition of any
lien, encumbrance, claim, security interest or restriction whatsoever upon any of the material
properties or assets of the Company or any subsidiary or an acceleration of indebtedness pursuant
to any obligation, agreement or condition contained in any Exchange Act Exhibit. Assuming the
correctness of the representations and warranties of the Buyers set forth herein, no consent,

regulatory body, administrative agency, or other governmental body in the United States or any
other person is required for the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the valid issuance
and sale of the Shares to be sold hereunder, other than such as have been made or obtained, and
