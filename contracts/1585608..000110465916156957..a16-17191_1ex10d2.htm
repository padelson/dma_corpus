 **WARRANT TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK 
OF JAGUAR ANIMAL HEALTH, INC.**

 



 

1. _Number of Shares and Exercise Price Subject to Warrant_. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth (including but not limited to Section 9 below), the Holder (as defined below) is entitled to purchase from Jaguar Animal Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), at any time the Warrant Stock (as defined below) on, or before, July 28, 2022 (the " _Termination Date_ "), at a price per share equal to the Warrant Price (as defined below), and subject to adjustments as described below) upon exercise of this Warrant pursuant to Section 6 hereof. **_This Warrant is executed and delivered in consideration of Holder s extension of the due date under Holders $150,000 Convertible Promissory Note between Serious Change II LP and Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. dated February 13, 2015._**

 



 

2. _Definitions_. As used in this Warrant, the following terms shall have the definitions ascribed to them below:

 



 

(a) " _Common Stock_ " shall mean a share of common stock of the Company

 



 

(b) " _Holder_ " shall mean SERIOUS CHANGE II LP or its permitted assigns.

 



 

(c) " _Securities_ " shall mean the security issued in the Companys Common
Stock.

 



 

(d) " _Warrant Price_ " shall be $0.01 per share subject to adjustment from
time to time in accordance with Section 3 below.

 



 

(e) " _Warrant Stock_ " shall mean 120,000 shares of the Companys Securities
subject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with Section 3 below.

      
 

 



 

3. _Adjustments and Notices_. The Warrant Price and Warrant Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with the following provisions:

 



 

(a) _Subdivision, Stock Dividends or Combinations_. In case the Company shall
at any time subdivide the outstanding shares of Securities subject to this
Warrant or shall issue a stock dividend with respect to the Securities, the
Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision or the issuance
of such dividend shall be proportionately decreased, and in case the Company
shall at any time combine the outstanding shares of the Securities, the
Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be
proportionately increased, effective at the close of business on the date of
such subdivision, dividend or combination, as the case may be. Simultaneously
with any adjustment to the Warrant Price pursuant to this _Section 3_, the
number of Warrant Stock shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this
Warrant shall be increased or decreased proportionately, so that after such
adjustment the aggregate Warrant Price payable hereunder for the increased or
decreased number of Warrant Stock shares shall be the same as the aggregate
Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment

 



 

(b) _Reclassification, Exchange, Substitution, In-Kind Distribution_. Upon
any reclassification, exchange, substitution, or other event that results in a
change of the number and/or class of the Warrant Stock or upon the payment of
a dividend in securities or property other than the Warrant Stock, the Holder
shall be entitled to receive, upon exercise or conversion of this Warrant, the
number and kind of securities and property that the Holder would have received
for the Warrant Stock if this Warrant had been exercised immediately before
the record date for such reclassification, exchange, substitution, or other
event or immediately prior to the record date for such dividend. The Company
or its successor shall promptly issue to the Holder a new Warrant for such new
securities or other property. The new Warrant shall provide for adjustments
which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
provided for in this Section 3 including, without limitation, adjustments to
the Warrant Price and to the number of securities or property issuable upon
exercise of the new Warrant. The provisions of this Section 3(b) shall
similarly apply to successive reclassifications, exchanges, substitutions, or
other events and successive dividends.

 



 

(c) _Notice of Adjustment Events_. Upon any adjustment of the Warrant Price
and any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Warrant Stock, then,
and in each such case, the Company, as promptly as practicable thereafter,
shall give written notice thereof to the Holder of this Warrant at the address
of such Holder as shown on the books of the Company which notice shall state
the Warrant Price as adjusted and the increased or decreased number of shares
of Warrant Stock, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation
of each.

 



 

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares shall be issuable upon exercise
or conversion of the Warrant and the number of shares of Warrant Stock to be
issued shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. If a fractional share
interest arises upon any exercise or conversion of the Warrant, the Company
shall eliminate such fractional share interest by paying the Holder an amount
computed by multiplying the fractional interest by the fair market value of a
full share of the Warrant Stock.

 



 

4. _No Stockholder Rights_. This Warrant, by itself, as distinguished from any shares purchased hereunder, shall not entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company except as provided herein.

 



 

5. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

 



 

(a) _Reservation of Stock_. The Company will, in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Warrant, reserve from its authorized and
unissued common stock, as applicable, a sufficient number of shares to provide
for the issuance of the Warrant Stock in the form of common stock, as
applicable, upon the exercise or conversion of this Warrant. Issuance of this
Warrant shall constitute full authority to the Companys officers who are
charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the
necessary certificates for shares of Warrant Stock issuable upon the exercise
or conversion of this Warrant.

 



      
 

 



 

6. _Exercise of Warrant_. This Warrant may be exercised in whole or part by the Holder prior to the termination of this Warrant, as provided in Section 9 hereof, by the surrender of this Warrant, together with the Notice of Exercise and Investment Representation Statement in the forms attached hereto as _Attachments 1 and 2_ , respectively, duly completed and executed at the principal office of the Company, specifying the portion of the Warrant to be exercised and accompanied by payment in full of the Warrant Price in cash or by check with respect to the shares of Warrant Stock being purchased. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately prior to the close of business on the date of its surrender for exercise as provided above, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Warrant Stock issuable upon such exercise shall be treated for all purposes as the Holder of such shares of record as of the close of business on such date. As promptly as practicable after such date, the Company shall issue and deliver to the person or persons entitled to receive the same a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Warrant Stock issuable upon such exercise. If the Warrant shall be exercised for less than the total number of shares of Warrant Stock then issuable upon exercise, promptly after surrender of the Warrant upon such exercise, the Company will execute and deliver a new Warrant, dated the date hereof, evidencing the right of the Holder to the balance of the Warrant Stock purchasable hereunder upon the same terms and conditions set forth herein.

 



 

7. _Conversion_. This Warrant shall not be exercisable on a "net exercise" basis, and the exercise price for this warrant shall always be paid in cash.

 



 

8. _Transfer of Warrant_. This Warrant may not be transferred or assigned by the Holder in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Company.

 



 

9. _Termination,_ This Warrant shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. California time on the Termination Date.

 



 

10. _Successors and Assigns_. Subject to the restrictions on transfer described in Section 8 above, and the termination provisions described in Section 9 above, the rights and obligations of the Company and the Holder shall be binding upon and benefit the successors, assigns, heirs, administrators and transferees of the parties.

 



 

11. _Governing Law and Venue_.

 



 

(a) This Warrant and all actions arising out of or in connection with this
Warrant shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of
the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of law provisions in
the State of California or any other state. The parties hereby consent to the
personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the California state courts
and the federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except with respect to enforcing claims for
injunctive or equitable relief, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out
of or relating in any way to this Warrant or the interpretation, application,
enforcement, breach, termination or validity thereof (including any claim of
inducement of this Warrant by fraud and including determination of the scope
or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate) or its subject matter
(collectively, " _Disputes_ " _)_ shall be determined by binding arbitration
before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS conducted
in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the
effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those

 



       
 

 



 

Rules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Federal
Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitrability of all Disputes. The
arbitration shall be held in San Francisco County, California, and it shall be
conducted in the English language. The parties shall maintain the confidential
nature of the arbitration proceeding and any award, including the hearing,
except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing
on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court
application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its
enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision. The
arbitrator shall have authority to award compensatory damages only and shall
not award any punitive, exemplary, or multiple damages, and the parties waive
any right to recover any such damages. Judgment on any award in arbitration
may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
above, each party shall have recourse to any court of competent jurisdiction
to enforce claims for injunctive and other equitable relief.

 



 

(c) IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES, WHETHER IT RESULTS IN
PROCEEDINGS IN ANY COURT IN ANY JURISDICTION OR IN ARBITRATION, THE PARTIES
HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND HAVING HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT
WITH COUNSEL, WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY, AND AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL
MATTERS SHALL BE DECIDED BY A JUDGE OR ARBITRATOR WITHOUT A JURY TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. To the extent applicable, in
the event of any lawsuit between the parties arising out of or related to this
Warrant, the parties agree to prepare and to timely file in the applicable
court a mutual consent to waive any statutory or other requirements for a
trial by jury.

INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION STATEMENT

 



 

Shares of Warrant Stock

 



 

(as __ defined in the attached Warrant) of

 



 

Jaguar Animal Health, Inc.

 



 

In connection with the purchase of the Warrant Stock, the undersigned hereby
represents to Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. (the " _Company_ ") as follows:

 



 

(a) The Warrant Stock to be received upon the exercise of the Warrant (the "
_Securities_ ") will be acquired for investment for its own account, not as a
nominee or agent, and not with a view to the sale or distribution of any part
thereof, and the undersigned has no present intention of selling, granting
participation in or otherwise distributing the same, but subject,
nevertheless, to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property
shall at all times be within its control. By executing this Investment
Representation Statement, the undersigned further represents that it does not
have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to
sell, transfer, or grant participations to such person or to any third person,
with respect to the Securities.

 



 

(b) The undersigned understands that the Securities are not registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "), and applicable state
securities laws, on the ground that the issuance of such securities is exempt
pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and state law exemptions relating to
offers and sales not by means of a public offering, and that the Companys
reliance on such exemptions is predicated on the undersigneds representations
set forth herein.

 



 

(c) The undersigned agrees that in no event will it make a disposition of the
Securities unless and until (i) it shall have notified the Company of the
proposed disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a statement of
the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and if requested by
the Company, (ii) it shall have furnished the Company with an opinion of
counsel satisfactory to the Company and the Companys counsel to the effect
that (A) appropriate action necessary for compliance with the Act and any
applicable state securities laws has been taken or an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Act and such laws is available, and (B) the
proposed transfer will not violate any of said laws.

 



 

(d) The undersigned acknowledges that an investment in the Company is highly
speculative and represents that it is able to fend for itself in the
transactions contemplated by this Investment Representation Statement, is an
"Accredited Investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D ****
promulgated under the Act or has such knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
its investments, and has the ability to bear the economic risks (including the
risk of a total loss) of its investment. The undersigned represents that it
has had the opportunity to ask questions of the Company concerning the
Companys business and assets and to obtain any additional information which
it considered necessary to verify the accuracy of or to amplify the Companys
disclosures, and has had all questions which have been asked by it
satisfactorily answered by the Company.

 



 

(e) The undersigned acknowledges that the Securities must be held indefinitely
unless subsequently registered under the Act or an exemption from such
registration is available. The undersigned is aware of the provisions of Rule
144 promulgated under the Act which permit limited resale of shares purchased
in a private placement subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including, among other things, the existence of a public market for the
shares, the availability of certain current public information about the
Company, the resale occurring not less than one year after a party has
purchased and paid for the security to be sold, the sale being through a
"brokers transaction" or in transactions directly with a "market

      
 

 



 

makers" (as provided by Rule 144(f)) and the number of shares being sold
during any three-month period not exceeding specified limitations.
