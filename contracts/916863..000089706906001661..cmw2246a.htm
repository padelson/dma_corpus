6.13. <U>Tax Treatment</U>. The parties intend the Merger to qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code. This Agreement will constitute a &#147;plan of
reorganization&#148; for purposes of Sections&nbsp;354 and 361 of the Code. Each party
and its affiliates shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify and to
obtain the opinions of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae LLP and Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore
LLP to the effect that the Merger will be treated for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as
a &#147;reorganization&#148;within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
Parent, Sub and the Company will each be a party to that reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. For tax purposes, each party and its affiliates
will report the Merger in a manner consistent with this Section. For purposes of the tax
opinions described in Sections&nbsp;7.02(d) and 7.03(d) of this Agreement, each of Parent
and the Company shall provide customary representations to LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene&nbsp;&amp; MacRae&nbsp;LLP
and Cravath, Swaine&nbsp;&amp; Moore&nbsp;LLP as each such counsel reasonably deems
relevant, necessary and satisfactory, including such representations and warranties set
forth on certificates of officers of Parent, the Company and any of their respective
subsidiaries, each dated on or about the date that is two business days prior to the date
the Joint Proxy Statement is mailed to the shareholders of Parent and the Company and
reissued in the same form as of the Closing Date. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company and
each of their respective affiliates shall not take any action and shall not fail to take
any action which action or failure to act would prevent, or would be reasonably likely to
prevent, the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.  </FONT></P>

Written

Meeting shall be delivered not less than ten days (unless a longer period is required by
the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation) nor more than 70 days before the date of such meeting either personally or
by mail, by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the President or the
Secretary, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting and to such
other shareholders as required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. In the event of
any Demand Special Meeting, such notice shall be sent not more than 45 days after the
Delivery Date. If mailed, notice pursuant to this Section 5 shall be deemed to be
effective when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his
address as it appears on the stock record books of the Corporation, with postage thereon
prepaid. Unless otherwise required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or the
Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, a notice of an Annual Meeting need not
include a description of the purpose for which the meeting is called. In the case of any
Special Meeting, (a) the notice of meeting shall describe any business that the Board of
Directors shall have theretofore determined to bring before the meeting and (b) in the
case of a Demand Special Meeting, the notice of meeting (i) shall describe any business
set forth in the statement of purpose of the demands received by the Corporation in
accordance with Section 3 of this Article II and (ii) shall contain all of the
information required in the notice received by the Corporation in accordance with Section
14(b) of this Article II. If an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting is adjourned to a
different date, time or place, the Corporation shall not be required to give notice of
the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting
before adjournment; provided, however, that if a new Meeting Record Date for an adjourned
meeting is or must be fixed, the Corporation shall give notice of the adjourned meeting

The
Board of Directors may fix in advance a date not less than 10 days and not more than 70
days prior to the date of any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting (other than a Demand
Special Meeting) as the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled
to notice of, and to vote at, such meeting (&#147;Meeting Record Date&#148;). If a
Meeting Record Date is not fixed by the Board of Directors or by the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law for any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting (other than a Demand Special
Meeting), the Meeting Record Date shall be the close of business on the day before the
first notice is given to Shareholders. In the case of any Demand Special Meeting, (i) the
Meeting Record Date shall not be later than the 30<SUP>th</SUP> day after the Delivery
Date and (ii) if the Board of Directors fails to fix the Meeting Record Date within 30
days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on such 30<SUP>th</SUP> day
shall be the Meeting Record Date. The shareholders of record on the Meeting Record Date
shall be the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting. Except as
provided by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law for a court-ordered adjournment, a
determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any Annual Meeting
or Special Meeting is effective for any adjournment of such meeting unless the Board of
Directors fixes a new Meeting Record Date, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned
to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting. The Board of
Directors may also fix in advance a date as the record date for the purpose of
determining shareholders entitled to take any other action or determining shareholders
for any other purpose. Such record date shall be not more than 70 days prior to the date
on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be
taken. The record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution (other
than a distribution involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the
Corporation&#146;s shares) or a share dividend is the date on which the Board of
Directors authorizes the distribution or share dividend, as the case may be, unless the
Board of Directors fixes a different record date.  </FONT></TD>

for inspection pursuant to this Section 7. The Corporation shall make the shareholders&#146; list

writing filed with the Secretary, in each case not less than 48 hours prior to the
meeting. The notice need not prescribe the purpose of the special meeting of the Board of
Directors or the business to be transacted at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall
be deemed to be effective when deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with
postage thereon prepaid. If notice is given by telegram, such notice shall be deemed to
be effective when the telegram is delivered to the telegraph company. If notice is given
by private carrier, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when delivered to the
private carrier. Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given to any director of
the Corporation under the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws or any provision of

notice shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. The Corporation shall

attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to him or her of
the meeting unless the director at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon his or

The
Board of Directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any
tangible or intangible property or benefit to the Corporation, including cash, promissory
notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed or other securities of
the Corporation. Before the Corporation issues shares, the Board of Directors shall
determine that the consideration received or to be received for the shares to be issued
is adequate. The determination of the Board of Directors is conclusive insofar as the
adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are
validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. The Corporation may place in escrow shares
issued in whole or in part for a contract for future services or benefits, a promissory
note, or otherwise for property to be issued in the future, or make other arrangements to
restrict the transfer of the shares, and may credit distributions in respect of the
shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the benefits or
property are received, or the promissory note is paid. If the services are not performed,
the benefits or property are not received, or the promissory note is not paid, the
Corporation may cancel, in whole or in part, the shares escrowed or restricted and the
distributions credited.  </FONT></TD>
