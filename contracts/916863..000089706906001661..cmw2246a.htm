The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". 

    

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Prior to the Closing, the parties shall prepare, and on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois, articles of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the _"Articles of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the IBCA and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the IBCA.

ARTICLE II

   

 _Effect on Shares of theConstituent 
Corporations; Exchange of Certificates _

   

 SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of Sub: 

    

 (a) _Shares of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

    

 (b) _Cancelation of Treasury Shares and Parent- Owned Shares._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or Parent shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no Parent Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

    

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ (1) Subject to Sections 2.01(b), 2.02(d) and 2.02(f), each issued share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid and nonassessable (except for statutory liability under Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL for unpaid employee wages) shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.02(f) are referred to collectively as " _Merger Consideration_ ". As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest. 

    

 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Exchange Agent._ Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a bank or trust company designated by Parent, and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.02(f). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Parent Common Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

        

* * *

 (b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until such time as a certificate representing Parent Common Stock is issued to or at the direction of the holder of a surrendered Certificate, such Parent Common Stock shall not be voted on any matter. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Subject to Section 2.02(d), until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.02. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 

        

* * *

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(f), until the surrender of such certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

    

 (d) _Dissenting Shares._ Holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have complied with requirements for perfecting dissentersÂ’ rights under Section 11.70 of the IBCA will be entitled to exercise such rights with respect to the shares as to which such rights have been perfected (" _Company Dissenting Shares_ "), to the extent available under Section 11.70 of the IBCA. Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company Dissenting Shares shall cease to be issued and outstanding and the holders thereof only shall be entitled to receive such consideration as will be determined under Section 11.70 of the IBCA. If a  holder of Company Dissenting Shares shall fail to perfect or shall otherwise  waive, withdraw or lose its dissentersÂ’ rights under the IBCA, such that  dissentersÂ’ rights can no longer be legally perfected or exercised under  the IBCA with respect to such Company Common Stock, then the right of such  holder to receive such consideration for Company Dissenting Shares as determined under Section 11.70 of the IBCA shall cease and such Company Dissenting Shares shall become exchangeable solely for the right to receive Parent Company Stock as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any notice relating to any Company Dissenting Shares received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any Company Dissenting Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

    

 (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, _subject_ , _however_ , to (i) the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation to pay or provide for the rights of dissenters and (ii) the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

        

* * *

 (f) _No Fractional Shares._ (1) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of this Section 2.02(f), all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places. 

    

 (2) In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company Common Stock who  would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an  amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the  product of (A) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of  Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled under Section 2.01(c)  (or would be entitled but for this Section 2.02(f)) and (B) Fair  Market Value. " _Fair Market Value_ " means an amount equal to the  average of the closing sale prices for the Parent Common Stock on the New York  Stock Exchange, Inc. (the " _NYSE_ ") Composite Transactions Tape  (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ (Northeastern edition), or if not reported thereby, as reported by any other authoritative source) for each of the ten consecutive trading days ending with the fifth complete trading day prior the Closing Date (not counting the Closing Date). 

    

 (3) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to  be paid to holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share  interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such  amounts, without interest, to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to  receive such cash. 

    

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of  Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II  shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger  Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common  Stock as contemplated by Section 2.02(c). 

      

 (h)   _Adjustment of Exchange Ratio._ In the event that Parent changes or establishes a record date for changing the number of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Parent Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio applicable to the Merger and any other calculations based on or relating to Parent Common Stock shall be appropriately, equitably and proportionately adjusted in light of such stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination or similar transaction. 

        

* * *

 (i) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration or any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.02(c) in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.05)), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

    

 (j) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. 

    

 (k) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Company Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, in each case  pursuant to this Agreement. 

    

 (l) _Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each other and take all reasonably necessary steps between the date hereof and the Effective Time to determine if any amounts should be withheld or deducted pursuant to the Code or under any provision of any state, county, local or foreign Tax Law, including, without limitation, Section 1445 of the Code, from payments or distributions made pursuant to this Agreement. Each of the parties and the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable under this Article II any amounts that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under any provision of Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 (b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in which employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary participate after the Effective Time, service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual or level of  benefits); provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the  extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. For  the avoidance of doubt, no employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary  will be entitled to receive benefits or credits under formulae applicable to  employees of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary hired prior to January 1, 2001. 

    

 (c) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitation under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its affiliates (other than the Company) in which employees of the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing  condition limitation would have been applicable under the comparable Company  welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall  recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all expenses incurred by each Company employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such yearÂ’s deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time to the extent such amounts were so recognized under the comparable Company welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.

If the existing DandO Insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six-year period, Parent shall use all  reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained as much DandO Insurance as can be  obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in  excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the existing DandO Insurance. The Company represents to Parent that the  Maximum Premium is $2.9 million.

If applicable, prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall mutually agree upon the portion of the consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger that is allocable to the real property of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in New York State, and Company, Sub, Parent and the Surviving Company shall not take any positions that are inconsistent with or contrary to such allocation. 

    

 SECTION 6.10. _Affiliates_.

 SECTION 6.13. _Tax Treatment_. The parties intend the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. This Agreement will constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. Each party and its affiliates shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify and to obtain the opinions of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene and MacRae LLP and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP to the effect that the Merger will be treated for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization"within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that Parent, Sub and the Company will each be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. For tax purposes, each party and its affiliates will report the Merger in a manner consistent with this Section. For purposes of the tax opinions described in Sections 7.02(d) and 7.03(d) of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall provide customary representations to LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene and MacRae LLP and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP as each such counsel reasonably deems relevant, necessary and satisfactory, including such representations and warranties set forth on certificates of officers of Parent, the Company and any of their respective subsidiaries, each dated on or about the date that is two business days prior to the date the Joint Proxy Statement is mailed to the shareholders of Parent and the Company and reissued in the same form as of the Closing Date. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company and each of their respective affiliates shall not take any action and shall not fail to take any action which action or failure to act would prevent, or would be reasonably likely to prevent, the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

    

 SECTION 6.14. _Board of Directors and Related Matters_. (a) Board of Directors. The Parent Board shall take such action as may be necessary to cause at the Effective Time:

---|--- 
   
       | (ii) of the directors comprising the Parent Board,
nine (9) to be designated by Parent and seven (7) to be designated by the

Chairman of the Parent Board; and    
---|--- 
   
       | (iv) the Parent By-Laws to be amended as provided
in Exhibit B.    
---|--- 
   
   

 Other than Mr. Weyers, all directors designated pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall meet the independence standards of the listing standards of the NYSE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the Effective Time, any of such designees shall decline or be unable to serve, the respective party which designated such person shall designate another person to serve in such personÂ’s stead. The Parent Board shall take such action as may be necessary to cause there to be an Executive Committee of the Parent Board at the Effective Time consisting of four directors, with Parent and the Company each designating one director to such committee and the Chief Executive Officer and non-executive Chairman of the Parent Board comprising the other two members of such committee. The Parent Board shall also take such action as may be necessary to cause the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Governance Committee and the Financial Committee of the Parent Board at the Effective Time each to be comprised directors selected by Parent and the Company respectively in approximately a nine to seven ratio (the ratio of directors on the Parent Board set forth in Section 6.14(a)(ii) above). For example, for a committee of three directors, Parent shall select two of the initial directors and the Company shall select one; for a committee of four directors, Parent shall select two of the initial directors and the Company shall select two; and for a committee of five directors, Parent shall select three of the initial directors and the Company shall select two.

       | (iii) the headquarters of the utilities businesses
will be located in the same place as immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 SECTION 6.15. _Dividends_. (a) Coordination of Dividends. Each of Parent and Company shall coordinate with the other regarding the declaration and payment of dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of Parent and Company that no holder of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect to its shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, and/or any shares of Parent Common Stock any holder of Company Common Stock receives pursuant to the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the partiesÂ’ intent that (i) the first quarterly dividend paid to the holders of the Parent Common Stock (including former holders of Company Common Stock) following the Effective Time shall be paid in accordance with the policy described in Section 6.15(b), with effect from the Closing Date, and (ii) the parties accordingly shall coordinate their declaration and payment of dividends prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall coordinate the declaration and payment of its dividends after the Effective time to achieve such intent.

 (b) _Dividends after the Effective Time_. Parent shall adopt a dividend policy immediately after the Effective Time, and in no event later than the first record date for the payment of dividends after the Closing Date, providing for a quarterly dividend of $0.66 per share of Parent Common Stock, but this policy will be evaluated over time as future business needs dictate. 

    

 SECTION 6.16. _Transition Committee_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Parent and Company shall establish a transition planning committee (the " _Transition Committee_ ") consisting of five individuals, three of whom will be designated by Parent and two of whom shall be designated by Company. Mr. Weyers shall be one of the members of the Transition Committee designated by Parent and shall be the chairman of the Transition Committee. The activities of the Transition Committee shall include: 

    

 (a) the development of regulatory plans and proposals, corporate organizational and  management plans, workforce combination proposals and other matters as the  Transition Committee deems appropriate; and 

    

 (b) the evaluation of the appropriate manner in which to organize and manage the  businesses, operations and assets of Parent and Surviving Corporation after the  Effective Time.

 SECTION 1.1 ANNUAL MEETING. The annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held on or before the last business day of the anniversary month of the filing of the corporationÂ’s Articles of Incorporation, beginning in the year 2007, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting. If the day fixed for the annual meeting shall be a legal holiday, such meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day. If the election of directors shall not be held on the day designated herein for any annual meeting, or at any adjournment thereof, the board of directors shall cause the election to be held at a special meeting of the shareholders as soon thereafter as may be convenient. 

   

 SECTION 1.2 SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the president, by the board of directors or by the holders of not less than one-fifth of all the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote on the matter for which the meeting is called. 

   

 SECTION 1.3 PLACE OF MEETING. Meetings of shareholders may be held at such place, either within or without the State of incorporation, as may be designated in the notice or waiver of notice of the meeting. If no designation is made, the place of the meeting shall be the principal office of the corporation. 

   

 SECTION 1.4 NOTICE AND WAIVER OF NOTICE. Written notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, or in the case of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale, lease or exchange of assets, not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the president, or the secretary, or the officer or persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope addressed to the shareholder at the shareholderÂ’s address as it appears on the records of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given, a waiver thereof in writing signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Attendance at any meeting shall constitute waiver of notice thereof unless the person at the meeting objects to the holding of the meeting because proper notice was not given. 

       

* * *

    

 SECTION 1.5 CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS AND FIXING RECORD DATE. For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors of the corporation may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than 60 days and, for a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days, or in the case of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale, lease or exchange of assets, not less than 20 days, immediately preceding such meeting. If no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the board of directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this Section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof. 

   

 SECTION 1.6 VOTING OF SHARES. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders. 

   

 SECTION 1.7 QUORUM AND REQUIRED VOTE. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of shareholders; provided, that if less than a quorum is present, a majority of the shares represented at the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting shall be the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by law or the Articles of Incorporation. 

   

 SECTION 1.8 PROXIES. A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for such shareholder by signing an appointment form and delivering it to the person so appointed. Unless the appointment of a proxy contains an express limitation on the proxyÂ’s authority, a corporation may accept the proxyÂ’s vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment. 

   

 No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy continues in full force and effect until revoked by the person executing it prior to the vote pursuant thereto, except as otherwise provided in this Section. Such revocation may be effected by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the person executing the proxy. The dates contained on the forms of proxy presumptively determine the order of execution, regardless of the postmark dates on the envelopes in which they are mailed. 

     SECTION 1.9 INFORMAL ACTION BY SHAREHOLDERS. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the corporation, or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, may be taken without a meeting and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed (i) by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voting or (ii) by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof. If such consent is signed by less than all of the shareholders entitled to vote on the action which is the subject of the consent, then such consent shall become effective only if at least 5 days prior to the execution of the consent a notice in writing is delivered to all the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof and, after the effective date of consent, prompt notice of the taking of the corporation action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be delivered in writing to those shareholders who have not consented in writing. 

   

 SECTION 1.10 VOTING OF SHARES BY CERTAIN HOLDERS. Shares registered in the name of a deceased person, a minor ward or an incompetent person, may be voted by such personÂ’s administrator, executor, court appointed guardian or conservator either in person or by proxy without a transfer of such shares into the name of such administrator, executor, court appointed guardian or conservator. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by such trustee either in person or by proxy. 

   

 Shares registered in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into such receiverÂ’s name if authority to do so is contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was appointed. 

   

 A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred. 

   

 SECTION 1.11 VOTING TRUST AGREEMENTS. Any number of shareholders of the corporation may create a voting trust for the purpose of conferring upon a trustee or trustees the right to vote or otherwise represent their shares, for a period not to exceed 10 years, by entering into a written voting trust agreement specifying the terms and conditions of the voting trust, and by transferring their shares to such trustee or trustees for the purposes of the agreement. Any such trust agreement shall not become effective until a counterpart of the agreement is deposited with the corporation at its registered office. The counterpart of the voting trust agreement so deposited with the corporation shall be subject to the same right of examination by a shareholder of the corporation, in person or by agent or attorney, as is the record of shareholders of the corporation, and shall be subject to examination by any holder of a beneficial interest in the voting trust, either in person or by agent or attorney, at any reasonable time for any proper purpose. 

     SECTION 1.12 CORPORATE RECORDS; EXAMINATION BY SHAREHOLDERS. The corporation shall keep correct and complete books and records of account and minutes of the proceedings of its shareholders and board of directors and committees thereof. The corporation shall also keep at its principal place of business, or at its agentÂ’s place of business, a record of its shareholders, giving the names and addresses of all shareholders and the number and class of shares held by each. 

   

 Any person who is a shareholder of record shall have the right to examine, in person or by agent, at any reasonable time or times, the corporationÂ’s books and records of account, minutes, voting trust agreements filed with the corporation and record of shareholders, and to make extracts therefrom but only for a proper purpose. In order to exercise this right, a shareholder must make written demand upon the corporation, stating with particularity the records sought to be examined and the purpose therefor.

A regular annual meeting of the board of directors shall be held without other notice than this Bylaw, immediately after and at the same place as the annual meeting of shareholders. The board of directors may provide, by resolution, the time and place, at any reasonable location, for the holding of additional regular meetings without other notice than such resolution.

or the Secretary shall have called such meeting. In the case of any Special
Meeting called by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary
upon the demand of shareholders (a "Demand Special Meeting"), such meeting
shall be held at such hour and day as may be designated by the Board of
Directors; provided, however, that the date of any Demand Special Meeting
shall be not more than seventy days after the  Meeting Record Date (as
defined in Section 6 of Article II of these By-laws);  and provided further
that in the event that the directors then in office fail to designate an hour
and date for a Demand Special Meeting within ten days after the date that
valid written demands for such meeting by the holders of record as of the
Demand Record Date of shares representing at least 10% of all the votes
entitled to be cast on each issue proposed to be considered at the Special
Meeting are delivered to the Corporation (the "Delivery Date"), then such
meeting shall be held at 2:00 P.M. local time on the 100th day after the
Delivery Date or, if such 100th day is not a Business Day (as defined 
below), on the first preceding Business Day. In fixing a meeting date for
any  Special Meeting, the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board,
the  President or the Secretary may consider such factors as it or he deems
relevant  within the good faith exercise of its or his business judgment,
including,  without limitation, the nature of the action proposed to be
taken, the facts and circumstances surrounding any demand for such meeting,
and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an Annual Meeting or a Special
Meeting for the conduct of related business.

     recognized independent  inspectors of elections to act as an agent of the
Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of
the validity of any purported  written demand or demands for a Special
Meeting received by the Secretary. For  the purpose of permitting the
inspectors to perform such review, no purported  demand shall be deemed to
have been delivered to the Corporation until the  earlier of (i) five
Business Days following receipt by the Secretary of such  purported demand
and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation
that the valid demands received by the Secretary represent at least 10% of
all the votes entitled to be cast on each issue proposed to be considered at
the Special Meeting. Nothing contained in this paragraph (f) shall in any way
be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any
shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any
demand, whether during or after such five Business Day period, or to take any
other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or
defense of any litigation with respect thereto).   
---|---|--- 
   
       | g.  | For purposes of these By-laws, "Business Day" shall
mean any day other  than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking
institutions in the State of Wisconsin are authorized or obligated by law or
executive order to close.   
---|---|--- 
   
     4\.  | Place of Meeting   
---|--- 
   
       |  The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the
President or the Secretary may designate any place, either within or without
the State of Wisconsin, as the place of meeting for any Annual Meeting or for
any Special Meeting or for any postponement or adjournment thereof. If no
designation is made, the place of meeting shall be the principal business
office of the Corporation in the State of Wisconsin. Any meeting may be
adjourned to reconvene at any place designated by vote of the Board of
Directors or by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary.   
---|--- 
   
     ---|--- 
   
       |  Written or printed notice stating the date, time and place
of any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting shall be delivered not less than ten
days (unless a longer period is required by the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law or the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation) nor more
than 70 days before the date of such meeting either personally or by mail, by
or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the President or
the Secretary, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting
and to such other shareholders as required by the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law. In the event of any Demand Special Meeting, such notice
shall be sent not more than 45 days after the Delivery Date. If mailed,
notice pursuant to this Section 5 shall be deemed to be effective when
deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at
his address as it appears on the stock record books of the Corporation, with
postage thereon prepaid. Unless otherwise required by the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law or the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, a notice
of an Annual Meeting need not include a description of the purpose for which
the meeting is called. In the case of any Special Meeting, (a) the notice of
meeting shall describe any business that the Board of Directors shall have
theretofore determined to bring before the meeting and (b) in the case of a
Demand Special Meeting, the notice of meeting (i) shall describe any
business set forth in the statement of purpose of the demands received by the
Corporation in accordance with Section 3 of this Article II and (ii) shall
contain all of the information required in the notice received by the
Corporation in accordance with Section 14(b) of this Article II. If an Annual
Meeting or Special Meeting is adjourned to a different date, time or place,
the Corporation shall not be required to give notice of the new date, time or
place if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before
adjournment; provided, however, that if a new Meeting Record Date for an
adjourned meeting is or must be fixed, the Corporation shall give notice of
the adjourned meeting to persons who are shareholders as of the new Meeting
Record Date.   
---|--- 
   
     6\.  | Fixing of Record Date   
---|--- 
   
       |  The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date not less
than 10 days and not more than 70 days prior to the date of any Annual
Meeting or Special Meeting (other than a Demand Special Meeting) as the
record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, such meeting ("Meeting Record Date"). If a Meeting Record
Date is not fixed by the Board of Directors or by the Wisconsin
Business Corporation Law for any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting (other
than a Demand Special Meeting), the Meeting Record Date shall be the close of
business on the day before the first notice is given to Shareholders. In the
case of any Demand Special Meeting, (i) the Meeting Record Date shall not be
later than the 30th day after the Delivery Date and (ii) if the Board of
Directors fails to fix the Meeting Record Date within 30 days after the
Delivery Date, then the close of business on such 30th day shall be the
Meeting Record Date. The shareholders of record on the Meeting Record
Date shall be the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
meeting. Except as provided by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law for a
court-ordered adjournment, a determination of shareholders entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting is effective for
any adjournment of such meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new
Meeting Record Date, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned to a date
more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting. The Board
of Directors may also fix in advance a date as the record date for the
purpose of determining shareholders entitled to take any other action or
determining shareholders for any other purpose. Such record date shall be not
more than 70 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring
such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. The record date for
determining shareholders entitled to a distribution (other than a
distribution involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of
the CorporationÂ’s shares) or a share dividend is the date on which the Board
of Directors authorizes the distribution or share dividend, as the case may
be, unless the Board of Directors fixes a different record date.   
---|--- 
   
     ---|--- 
   
       |  After a Meeting Record Date has been fixed, the Corporation
shall prepare a list of the names of all of the shareholders entitled to
notice of the meeting. The list shall be arranged by class or series of
shares, if any, and show the address of, and number of shares held by, each
shareholder. Such list shall be available for inspection by any
shareholder, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given
for which the list was prepared and continuing to the date of the meeting, at
the CorporationÂ’s principal office or at a place identified in the meeting
notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A shareholder or his agent
may, on written demand, inspect and, subject to the limitations imposed by
the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, copy the list, during regular
business hours and at his or her expense, during the period that it is
available for inspection pursuant to this Section 7. The Corporation shall
make the shareholdersÂ’ list available at the meeting and any shareholder or
his or her agent or attorney may inspect the list at any time during the
meeting or any adjournment thereof. Refusal or failure to prepare or make
available the shareholdersÂ’ list shall not affect the validity of any action
taken at a meeting of shareholders.   
---|--- 
   
     8\.  | Quorum and Voting Requirements; Postponements; Adjournments
  
---|--- 
   
     may take action on a matter at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting only if
a quorum of those shares exists with respect to that matter. If the
Corporation has only one class of stock  outstanding, such class shall
constitute a separate voting group for purposes of this Section 8. Except as
otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation of this Corporation or
the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a majority of the votes entitled to
be cast on the matter shall constitute a quorum of the voting group for
action on that matter. Once a share is represented for any purpose at any
Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, other than for the purpose of objecting to
holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is considered
present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for the remainder
of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting, unless a new Meeting
Record Date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting. If a quorum exists,
except in the case of the election of directors, action on a matter shall be
approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed
the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation of
the Corporation or the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law requires a greater
number of affirmative  votes. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of
Incorporation of the  Corporation, each director shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes cast by  the shares entitled to vote in the election
of directors at any Annual Meeting  or Special Meeting at which a quorum is
present.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | The Board of Directors acting by resolution may
postpone and reschedule any  previously scheduled Annual Meeting or Special
Meeting; provided, however, that  a Demand Special Meeting shall not be
postponed beyond the 100th day  following the Delivery Date. Any Annual
Meeting or Special Meeting may be  adjourned from time to time, whether or
not there is a quorum, (i) at any time,  upon a resolution of shareholders if
the votes cast in favor of such resolution  by the holders of shares of each
voting group entitled to vote on any matter  theretofore properly brought
before the meeting exceed the number of votes cast  against such resolution
by the holders of shares of each such voting group or  (ii) at any time prior
to the transaction of any business at such meeting, by  the Chairman of the
Board, the President or the Secretary or pursuant to a  resolution of the
Board of Directors. No notice of the time and place of  adjourned meetings
need be given except as required by the Wisconsin Business  Corporation Law.
At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or  represented,
any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at  the
meeting as originally notified.   
---|---|--- 
   
     9\.  | Conduct of Meetings   
---|--- 
   
     Chairman of the Board, and in his absence, the President, and in their
absence, a Vice President in the order provided under Section 4 of Article IV
of these By-laws, and in their absence, any person chosen by the shareholders
present shall call any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting to order and shall
act as chairman of such meeting, and the Secretary of the Corporation shall
act as secretary of all Annual Meetings and Special Meetings, but in the
absence of the Secretary, the presiding officer may appoint any other person
to act as secretary of the meeting.   
---|--- 
   
     10\.  | Proxies   
---|--- 
   
       |  At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder entitled to
vote may vote his or her or its shares in person or by proxy. A shareholder
entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders may authorize another person to
act for the shareholder by appointing the person as proxy. Without limiting
the manner in which a shareholder may appoint a proxy, a shareholder or the
shareholderÂ’s authorized officer, director, employee, agent or attorney-in-
fact may use any of the following as a valid means to make such
an appointment:   
---|--- 
   
       | a.  | Appointment of a proxy in writing by signing or causing
the shareholderÂ’s signature to be affixed to an appointment form by any
reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | Appointment of a proxy by transmitting or authorizing
the transmission of an electronic transmission of the appointment to the
person who will be appointed as proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy
support service organization or like agent authorized to receive the
transmission by the person who will be appointed as proxy. Every electronic
transmission shall contain, or be accompanied by, information that can be
used to reasonably determine that the shareholder transmitted or authorized
the transmission of the electronic transmission. Any person charged with
determining whether a shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission
of the electronic transmission shall specify the information upon which the
determination is made.   
---|---|--- 
   
       |  An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed
appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received
by the inspector of elections or the officer or agent of the Corporation
authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for 11 months unless a
different period is expressly provided in the appointment. Unless otherwise
provided, a proxy may be revoked any time before it is voted, either
by appointing a new proxy in accordance with the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law or by oral notice given by the shareholder to the presiding
officer during the meeting. The presence of a shareholder who has made an
effective proxy appointment shall not itself constitute a revocation. The
Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to make rules
establishing presumptions as to the validity and sufficiency of proxies.   
---|--- 
   
     ---|--- 
   
       | a.  | Each outstanding share shall be entitled to one vote
upon each matter submitted to a vote at any Annual Meeting or Special
Meeting, except to the extent that the voting rights of the shares of any
class or classes are enlarged, limited or  denied by the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law or the Articles of  Incorporation of the Corporation.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | Shares held by another corporation, if a sufficient
number of shares entitled to elect a majority of the directors of such other
corporation is held directly or  indirectly by the Corporation, shall not be
entitled to vote at any Annual  Meeting or Special Meeting, but shares held
in a fiduciary capacity may be  voted.   
---|---|--- 
   
     12\.  | Acceptance of Instruments Showing Shareholder Action   
---|--- 
   
       |  If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy
appointment corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the Corporation, if
acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy
appointment and give it effect as the act of a shareholder. If the
name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment does not
correspond to the name of a shareholder, the Corporation, if acting in good
faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it
effect as the act of the shareholder if any of the following apply:   
---|--- 
   
       | a.  | The shareholder is an entity and the name signed
purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | The name purports to be that of a personal
representative, administrator, executor, guardian or conservator representing
the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary
status acceptable to the Corporation is presented with respect to the vote,
consent, waiver or proxy appointment.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | c.  | The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or
trustee in bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests,
evidence of this status  acceptable to the Corporation is presented with
respect to the vote, consent,  waiver or proxy appointment.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | d.  | The name signed purports to be that of a pledgee,
beneficial owner, or  attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if the
Corporation requests, evidence  acceptable to the Corporation of the
signatoryÂ’s authority to sign for the  shareholder is presented with respect
to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy  appointment.   
---|---|--- 
   
     or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of
the co-owners and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all
co-owners.   
---|---|--- 
   
   

The Corporation may reject a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment if
the Secretary or other officer or agent of the Corporation who is authorized
to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about
the validity of the signature on it or about the signatoryÂ’s authority to
sign for the shareholder.

     13\.  | Waiver of Notice by Shareholders   
---|--- 
   
       |  A shareholder may waive any notice required by the Wisconsin
Business Corporation Law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation or
these By-laws before or after the date and time stated in the notice. The
waiver shall be in writing and signed by the shareholder entitled to the
notice, contain the same information that would have been required in the
notice under applicable provisions of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law
(except that the time and place of meeting need not be stated) and be
delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the corporate records. A
shareholderÂ’s attendance at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, in person
or by proxy, waives objection to all of the following: (a) lack of notice or
defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of
the meeting or promptly upon arrival objects to holding the meeting or
transacting business at the meeting; and (b) consideration of a particular
matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose described in the
meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when
it is presented.

Annual Meeting in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under
the Exchange Act) more than 70 days prior to the first annual anniversary
of the date set forth in the CorporationÂ’s proxy statement for
the immediately preceding Annual Meeting as the date on which the
Corporation first mailed definitive proxy materials for the immediately
preceding Annual Meeting (the "Anniversary Date"); provided, however,
that in the event that the date for which the Annual Meeting is called

notice  by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than
the close of business on the 100th day prior to the date of such Annual
Meeting and not later than (A) the 75th day prior to the date of such Annual
Meeting or (B) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of
the date of such Annual Meeting is first made. In no event shall the

period for the giving of a shareholder notice as described above. Such
shareholderÂ’s notice shall be signed by the shareholder of record who intends
to make the nomination or introduce the other business (or his duly
authorized proxy or other representative), shall bear the date of signature

material interest in such business of such shareholder and beneficial owner
or owners.   
---|---|--- 
   
     paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 14 to the contrary, in the event that the
number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the
Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of
the nominees for director or specifying the  size of the increased Board of
Directors made by the Corporation at least  45 days prior to the Anniversary
Date, a shareholderÂ’s notice required by this Section 14 shall also be
considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions
created by such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the
principal offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on
the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first
made by the Corporation.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | _Special Meetings_. Only such business shall be
conducted at a Special Meeting as shall have been described in the notice of
meeting sent to shareholders pursuant to Section 5 of Article II of these By-
laws. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be

such notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors
or (ii) by any shareholder of the Corporation who (A) is a shareholder of
record at the time of giving of such notice of meeting, (B) is entitled to

procedures set forth in  this Section 14 shall be eligible to serve as
directors. Only such business shall be conducted at an Annual Meeting or
Special Meeting as shall have been brought before such meeting in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 14. The chairman of the meeting
shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any

       | (iii)  | Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 14, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to
the matters set forth in this  Section 14. Nothing in this Section 14 shall

# ARTICLE III. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     1\.  | General Powers   
---|--- 
   
       |  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed
by its Board of Directors. The Board shall determine the nature and character
of the business to be conducted by the Corporation and the method of doing
so; what employees, agents, and officers shall be employed and their
compensation; and what purchases or contracts for purchase shall be made. The
Board may delegate any of its aforesaid powers to committees or to
officers, agents, or employees as it may from time to time determine. The
Board of Directors may elect from among the directors a Chairman of the Board
of Directors and a Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors.   
---|--- 
   
     2\.  | Number of Directors   
---|--- 
   
       |  The number of directors of the Corporation shall be 16,
divided into three classes: designated Class A, Class B, and Class C. Each
class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total
number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.   
---|--- 
   
     3\.  | Term   
---|--- 
   
     on the date of the ____* annual meeting of shareholders; the term of the
initial Class B directors shall terminate on the date of the ____* annual
meeting of shareholders; and the term of the Class C directors shall
terminate on the date of the ____* annual meeting of shareholders. At each
annual meeting of shareholders beginning in ____*, successors to the class of
directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for
a three-year term and until their successors are elected and qualified. If
the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease in directorships
shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of
directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional
directors of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase
in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the
remaining term of that class, but in no case will a decrease in the number
of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.

 _[*NOTE Â—these dates will be as follows: 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2007,
respectively, if the Effective Time of the Merger is before the 2007 annual
shareholder meeting; or 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2008, respectively, if the

     4\.  | Qualifications   
---|--- 
   
       |  No director shall be eligible for re-election after
attaining the age of 70 years. Directors need not be shareholders of the
Corporation or residents of the State of Wisconsin.   
---|--- 
   
     5\.  | Meetings   
---|--- 
   
       |  The Board of Directors shall hold its meetings at such place
or places, within or without the State of Wisconsin, as the Board may from
time to time determine.   
---|--- 
   
       | a.  | A meeting of the Board of Directors, to be known as the
annual meeting, may be  held, without notice, immediately after and at the
same place as the annual  meeting of the shareholders at which such Board is
elected, for the purpose of  electing the officers of the Corporation and to
transact such other business as  may come before the Board. Such annual
meeting may be held at a different place  than the annual meeting of
shareholders and/or on a date subsequent to the  annual meeting of
shareholders, if notice of such different place and/or date  has been given
to or waived by all the directors.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held
without call and without notice, at such times and in such places as the
Board may by resolution from time to time determine.   
---|---|--- 
   
     called at any time by the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive
Officer and shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon the
written request of three or more directors.   
---|---|--- 
   
     6\.  | Notice; Waiver   
---|--- 
   
       |  Notice of each special meeting of the Board of Directors
shall be given by written notice delivered or communicated in person, by
telegraph, teletype, facsimile or other form of wire or wireless
communication, or by mail or private carrier, to each director at his or her
business address or at such other address as such director shall have
designated in writing filed with the Secretary, in each case not less than 48
hours prior to the meeting. The notice need not prescribe the purpose of the
special meeting of the Board of Directors or the business to be transacted at
such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when
deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with postage thereon
prepaid. If notice is given by telegram, such notice shall be deemed to be
effective when the telegram is delivered to the telegraph company. If notice
is given by private carrier, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when
delivered to the private carrier. Whenever any notice whatever is required to
be given to any director of the Corporation under the Articles of
Incorporation or these By-laws or any provision of the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed at any time, whether
before or after the date and time of meeting, by the director entitled to
such notice shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. The
Corporation shall retain any such waiver as part of the permanent corporate
records. A directorÂ’s attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any
required notice to him or her of the meeting unless the director at the
beginning of the meeting or promptly upon his or her arrival objects to
holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not
thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.   
---|--- 
   
     7\.  | Quorum   
---|--- 
   
       |  Except as otherwise provided by the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law or by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws, a
majority of the number of directors specified in Section 2 of Article III of
these By-laws shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at
any meeting of the Board of Directors. Except as otherwise provided by
the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the Articles of Incorporation, or
these By-laws, a quorum of any committee of the Board of Directors created
pursuant to Section 13 hereof shall consist of a majority of the number of
directors appointed to serve on the committee. A majority of the directors
present (though less than such quorum) may adjourn any meeting of the Board
of Directors or any committee thereof, as the case may be, from time to time
without further notice.   
---|--- 
   
     ---|--- 
   
       |  The affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present
at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof at which a
quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors or such
committee, as the case may be, unless the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law,
the Articles of Incorporation, or these By-laws require the vote of a greater
number of directors.   
---|--- 
   
     9\.  | Minutes of Meetings   
---|--- 
   
       |  Minutes of any regular or special meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be prepared and distributed to each director.

     11\.  | Compensation   
---|--- 
   
       |  The Board of Directors, irrespective of any personal
interest of any of its members, may establish reasonable compensation of all
directors for services to the Corporation as directors, officers, or
otherwise, or may delegate such authority to an appropriate committee. The
Board of Directors also shall have authority to provide for or
delegate authority to an appropriate committee to provide for reasonable
pensions, disability or death benefits, and other benefits or payments, to
directors, officers, and employees and to their estates, families,
dependents, or beneficiaries on account of prior services rendered by such
directors, officers, and employees to the Corporation.   
---|--- 
   
     12\.  | Presumption of Assent   
---|--- 
   
       |  A director who is present and is announced as present at a
meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof created in
accordance with Section 13 of this Article III, when corporate action is
taken, assents to the action taken unless any of the following occurs:   
---|--- 
   
       | a.  | The director objects at the beginning of the meeting or
promptly upon his or her  arrival to holding the meeting or transacting
business at the meeting;   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | The directorÂ’s dissent or abstention from the action
taken is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or   
---|---|--- 
   
     with the Wisconsin Business  Corporation Law of his or her dissent or
abstention to the presiding officer of  the meeting before its adjournment or
to the Corporation immediately after  adjournment of the meeting.   
---|---|--- 
   
       |  Such right of dissent or abstention shall not apply to a
director who votes in favor of the action taken.   
---|--- 
   
     13\.  | Committees   
---|--- 
   
       |  The Board of Directors by resolution adopted by the
affirmative vote of a majority of all of the directors then in office may

serve on the committees and designate other members of the Board of Directors
to serve as alternates. Each committee shall have two or more members
who shall, unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, serve at the
pleasure of the Board of Directors. A committee may be authorized to exercise
the authority of the Board of Directors, except that a committee may not do
any of the following:   
---|--- 
   
       | a.  | Authorize distributions;   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | Approve or propose to shareholders action that the
Wisconsin Business Corporation Law requires to be approved by shareholders;
  
---|---|--- 
   
       | c.  | Fill vacancies on the Board of Directors or, unless the
Board of Directors provides by resolution that vacancies on a committee shall
be filled by the affirmative vote of the remaining committee members, on any
Board committee;   
---|---|--- 
   
       | d.  | Amend the CorporationÂ’s Articles of Incorporation;   
---|---|--- 
   
       | e.  | Adopt, amend, or repeal By-laws;   
---|---|--- 
   
       | f.  | Approve a plan of merger not requiring shareholder

for sale of shares, or determine the designation and relative rights,
preferences and limitations of a class or series of shares, except that the
Board of Directors may authorize a committee to do so within limits
prescribed by the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise provided by the Board
of Directors in creating the committee, a committee may employ counsel,
accountants, and other consultants to assist it in the exercise of its
authority.   
---|---|--- 
   
     ---|--- 
   
       |  Except as herein provided and notwithstanding any place set
forth in the notice of the meeting or these By-laws, members of the Board of
Directors (and any committees thereof created pursuant to Section 13 of this
Article III) may participate in regular or special meetings by, or through
the use of, any means of communication by which all participants may
simultaneously hear each other, such as by conference telephone. If a meeting
is conducted by such means, then at the commencement of such meeting
the presiding officer shall inform the participating directors that a meeting
is taking place at which official business may be transacted. Any participant
in a meeting by such means shall be deemed present in person at such meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action may be taken at any meeting held by
such means on any particular matter which the presiding officer determines,
in his or her sole discretion, to be inappropriate under the circumstances
for action at a meeting held by such means. Such determination shall be made
and announced in advance of such meeting.   
---|--- 
   
     15\.  | Action without Meeting   
---|--- 
   
       |  Any action required or permitted by the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a
committee thereof created pursuant to Section 13 of this Article III may be
taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all members of the Board or
of the committee. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written
consents describing the action taken, signed by each director or
committee member, and retained by the Corporation. Such action shall be
effective when the last director or committee member signs the consent,
unless the consent specifies a different effective date.   
---|--- 
   
     16\.  | Non-Executive Chairman of the Board

       |  If a Chairman of the Board of Directors shall be elected, he
or she shall preside as Chairman of all meetings of the shareholders and of
the Board of Directors. He or she shall have such other authority as the
Board may from time to time prescribe. If there is no Chairman of the Board,
or in the absence of the Chairman, the presiding officer at meetings of the
shareholders, and of the Board of Directors shall be the Lead Director, if
any, or in the absence of the Lead Director, if any, another officer in the
following order of priority: Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors,
President and Vice Presidents (subject, however, to Section 4 of Article IV).
The Chairman shall be neither an officer nor an employee of the Corporation
by virtue of his or her election and service as Chairman of the Board;
provided, however, the Chairman may be an officer of the Corporation. The
Chairman may use the title Chairman or Chairman of the Board interchangeably.

       |  An officer may resign at any time by delivering notice to

     14\.  | Reassignment of Duties   
---|--- 
   
       |  In case of the absence or disability of any officer of the

# ARTICLE V. CERTIFICATES FOR AND TRANSFER OF SHARES

     1\.  | Form   
---|--- 
   
       |  Certificates representing shares of the Corporation shall be
in such form as shall be determined by the Board of Directors. All
certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise
identified. The name and address of the person to whom the shares
represented thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue,
shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the Corporation. All
certificates surrendered for the transfer shall be cancelled and no new
certificate shall be issued until the former certificate for a like number of
shares shall have been surrendered and cancelled, except in case of a lost or
destroyed certificate provided for in Section 4 of this Article V or a
certificate for shares transferred in compliance with the escheat laws of any
state.   
---|--- 
   
     ---|--- 
   
       |  Certificates representing shares of the Corporation shall be
signed by the President or a Vice President and by the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary; and may be sealed with the seal of the Corporation
(which may be a facsimile) and countersigned and registered in such manner,
if any, as the Board of Directors may prescribe. Whenever any certificate
is manually signed on behalf of a transfer agent, or a registrar, other than
the Corporation itself or an employee of the Corporation, the signatures of
the President, Vice President, Secretary, or Assistant Secretary, upon such
certificate may be facsimiles. In case any officer who has signed, or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon such certificate, ceases to be such
officer before such certificate is issued, it may be issued with the same
effect as if he or she were such officer at the date of its issue.   
---|--- 
   
     3\.  | Restrictions on Transfer   
---|--- 
   
       |  The face or reverse side of each certificate representing
shares shall bear a conspicuous notation of any restriction imposed by the
Corporation upon the transfer of such shares.   
---|--- 
   
     4\.  | Lost, Destroyed, or Stolen Certificates   
---|--- 
   
       |  Where the owner claims that his or her certificate for
shares has been lost, destroyed, or wrongfully taken, a new certificate shall
be issued in place thereof if the owner:   
---|--- 
   
       | a.  | So requests before the Corporation has notice that such
shares have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser;   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | Files with the Corporation a sufficient indemnity bond;
and   
---|---|--- 
   
       | c.  | Satisfies such other reasonable requirements as may be
prescribed by or under the authority of the Board of Directors.   
---|---|--- 
   
     5\.  | Transfer of Shares   
---|--- 
   
       |  Prior to due presentment of a certificate for shares for
registration of transfer the Corporation may treat the registered owner of
such shares as the person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive
notifications, and otherwise to have and exercise all the rights and powers
of an owner. Where a certificate for shares is presented to the Corporation
with a request to register for transfer, the Corporation shall not be
liable to the owner or any other person suffering loss as a result of such
registration of transfer if:   
---|--- 
   
     endorsements; and   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b. | The Corporation had no duty to inquire into adverse
claims or has discharged any  such duty.   
---|---|--- 
   
       |  The Corporation may require reasonable assurance that said
endorsements are genuine and effective and compliance with such other
regulations as may be prescribed by or under the authority of the Board of
Directors.   
---|--- 
   
     6\.  | Consideration for Shares   
---|--- 
   
       |  The Board of Directors may authorize shares to be issued for
consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to
the Corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed,
contracts for services to be performed or other securities of the
Corporation. Before the Corporation issues shares, the Board of Directors
shall determine that the consideration received or to be received for the
shares to be issued is adequate. The determination of the Board of Directors
is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of
shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid, and
nonassessable. The Corporation may place in escrow shares issued in whole or
in part for a contract for future services or benefits, a promissory note, or
otherwise for property to be issued in the future, or make other arrangements
to restrict the transfer of the shares, and may credit distributions in
respect of the shares against their purchase price, until the services are
performed, the benefits or property are received, or the promissory note is
paid. If the services are not performed, the benefits or property are not
received, or the promissory note is not paid, the Corporation may cancel, in
whole or in part, the shares escrowed or restricted and the distributions
credited.   
---|--- 
   
     7\.  | Other Rules   
---|--- 
   
       |  The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to
make all such further rules and regulations not inconsistent with the
statutes of the State of Wisconsin as it may deem expedient concerning the
issue, transfer, and registration of certificates representing shares of the
Corporation, including the appointment and designation of Transfer Agents and
Registrars.

     1\.  | Mandatory Indemnification   
---|--- 
   
     hereof, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth hereinafter in
this Article VI, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless any person
who is or was a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any Action
(see Section 16 of this Article VI for definitions of capitalized terms used
herein) by reason of his or her status as an Executive, and/or as to acts
performed in the course of such ExecutiveÂ’s duties to the Corporation and/or
an Affiliate, against Liabilities and reasonable Expenses incurred by or on
behalf of an Executive in connection with any Action, including, without
limitation, in connection with the investigation, defense, settlement or
appeal of any Action; provided, pursuant to Section 3 of this Article VI,
that it is not determined by the Authority, or by a court, that the Executive
engaged in misconduct which constitutes a Breach of Duty.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | To the extent an Executive has been successful on the
merits or otherwise in  connection with any Action, including, without
limitation, the settlement,  dismissal, abandonment, or withdrawal of any
such Action where the Executive  does not pay, incur, or assume any material
Liabilities, or in connection with  any claim, issue, or matter therein, he
or she shall be indemnified by the  Corporation against reasonable Expenses
incurred by or on behalf of him or her  in connection therewith. The
Corporation shall pay such Expenses to the  Executive (net of all Expenses,
if any, previously advanced to the Executive  pursuant to Section 2 of this
Article VI), or to such other person or  entity as the Executive may
designate in writing to the Corporation, within  ten days after the receipt
of the ExecutiveÂ’s written request  therefor, without regard to the
provisions of Section 3 of this  Article VI. In the event the Corporation
refuses to pay such requested  Expenses, the Executive may petition a court
to order the Corporation to make  such payment pursuant to Section 4 of this
Article VI.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | c.  | Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Article VI to the contrary, the Corporation shall not:   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (1)  | Indemnify, contribute, or advance Expenses to an
Executive with respect to any Action initiated or brought voluntarily by the
Executive and not by way of defense, except with respect to Actions:   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (a)  | brought to establish or enforce a right to
indemnification, contribution, and/or an advance of Expenses under Section 4
of this Article VI, under the Statute as it may then be in effect or under
any other statute or law or otherwise as required;   
---|---|--- 
   
     the extent such Executive is successful on the merits or otherwise in
connection with such an Action in  accordance with and pursuant to Section 1b
of this Article VI; or   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (c)  | as to which the Board determines it to be appropriate.
  
---|---|--- 
   
       | (2)  | indemnify the Executive under this Article VI for any
amounts paid in settlement of any Action effected without the CorporationÂ’s
written consent.   
---|---|--- 
   
       |  The Corporation shall not settle in any manner which would
impose any Liabilities or other type of limitation on the Executive without
the ExecutiveÂ’s written consent. Neither the Corporation nor the Executive
shall unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement.   
---|--- 
   
       | d.  | An ExecutiveÂ’s conduct with respect to an employee
benefit plan sponsored by or otherwise associated with the Corporation and/or
an Affiliate for a purpose he or she reasonably believes to be in the
interests of the participants in and beneficiaries of such plan is conduct
that does not constitute a breach or failure to perform his or her duties to
the Corporation or an Affiliate, as the case may be.   
---|---|--- 
   
     2\.  | Advance for Expenses   
---|--- 
   
       | a.  | The Corporation shall pay to an Executive, or to such
other person or entity as the Executive may designate in writing to the
Corporation, his or her reasonable  Expenses incurred by or on behalf of such
Executive in connection with any  Action, or claim, issue, or matter
associated with any such Action, in advance  of the final disposition or
conclusion of any such Action (or claim, issue, or  matter associated with
any such Action), within ten days after the receipt  of the ExecutiveÂ’s
written request therefor; provided, the following  conditions are satisfied:
  
---|---|--- 
   
       | (1)  | The Executive has first requested an advance of such
Expenses in writing (and  delivered a copy of such request to the
Corporation) from the insurance  carrier(s), if any, to whom a claim has been
reported under an applicable  insurance policy purchased by the Corporation
and each such insurance carrier,  if any, has declined to make such an
advance;   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (2)  | The Executive furnishes to the Corporation an executed
written certificate  affirming his or her good faith belief that he or she
has not engaged in  misconduct which constitutes a Breach of Duty; and   
---|---|--- 
   
     executed written agreement to repay any advances made under this Section 2 if
it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified
by the Corporation for such  Expenses pursuant to this Article VI.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | If the Corporation makes an advance of Expenses to an
Executive pursuant to this  Section 2, the Corporation shall be subrogated to
every right of recovery  the Executive may have against any insurance carrier
from whom the Corporation  has purchased insurance for such purpose.   
---|---|--- 
   
     3\.  | Determination of Right to Indemnification   
---|--- 
   
       | a.  | Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 3 or in
Section 1c of this Article VI, any indemnification to be provided to an
Executive by the  Corporation under Section 1a of this Article VI upon the
final  disposition or conclusion of any Action, or any claim, issue, or
matter  associated with any such Action, unless otherwise ordered by a court,
shall be  paid by the Corporation to the Executive (net of all Expenses, if
any,  previously advanced to the Executive pursuant to Section 2 of this 
Article VI), or to such other person or entity as the Executive may 
designate in writing to the Corporation, within 60 days after the receipt  of
the ExecutiveÂ’s written request therefor. Such request shall include an 
accounting of all amounts for which indemnification is being sought. No
further  corporate authorization for such payment shall be required other
than this  Section 3\.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | Notwithstanding the foregoing, the payment of such
requested indemnifiable amounts pursuant to Section 1a of this Article VI may
be denied by the Corporation if:   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (1)  | the Board by a majority vote thereof determines that
the Executive has engaged in misconduct which constitutes a Breach of Duty;
or   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (2)  | a majority of the directors of the Corporation are a
party in interest to such  Action.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | c.  | In either event of nonpayment pursuant to Section 3b of
this Article VI, the Board shall immediately authorize and direct, by
resolution, that an independent determination be made as to whether the
Executive has engaged in misconduct which constitutes a Breach of Duty and,
therefore, whether indemnification of the Executive is proper pursuant to
this Article VI.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | d.  | Such independent determination shall be made, at the
option of the Executive(s)  seeking indemnification, by:   
---|---|--- 
   
     below in Section 3f from the panels of arbitrators of the American
Arbitration Association) in  Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules then  prevailing of the American Arbitration
Association;   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (2)  | An independent legal counsel mutually selected by the
Executive(s) seeking  indemnification and the Board by a majority vote of a
quorum thereof consisting  of directors who were not parties in interest to
such Action (or, if such quorum is not obtainable, by the majority vote of
the entire Board); or   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (3)  | A court in accordance with Section 4 of this Article
VI.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | e.  | In any such determination there shall exist a
rebuttable presumption that the  Executive has not engaged in misconduct
which constitutes a Breach of Duty and  is, therefore, entitled to
indemnification hereunder. The burden of rebutting  such presumption by clear
and convincing evidence shall be on the Corporation.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | f.  | If a panel of arbitrators is to be employed hereunder,
one of such arbitrators  shall be selected by the Board by a majority vote of
a quorum thereof consisting of directors who were not parties in interest to
such Action or, if such quorum is not obtainable, by an independent legal
counsel chosen by the majority vote of the entire Board, the second by the
Executive(s) seeking indemnification, and the third by the previous two
arbitrators.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | g.  | The Authority shall make its independent determination
hereunder within 60 days of being selected and shall simultaneously submit a
written opinion of its conclusions to both the Corporation and the Executive.
  
---|---|--- 
   
       | h.  | If the Authority determines that an Executive is
entitled to be indemnified for  any amounts pursuant to this Article VI, the
Corporation shall pay such  amounts to the Executive (net of all Expenses, if
any, previously advanced to  the Executive pursuant to Section 2 of this
Article VI), including  interest thereon as provided in Section 6c of this
Article VI, or such other person or entity as the Executive may designate in
writing to the  Corporation, within ten days of receipt of such opinion.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | i.  | Except with respect to any judicial determination
pursuant to Section 4 of this Article VI, the Expenses associated with the
indemnification process set forth in this Section 3 of this Article VI,
including, without  limitation, the Expenses of the Authority selected
hereunder, shall be paid by  the Corporation.   
---|---|--- 
   
     ---|--- 
   
       | a.  | An Executive may, either before or within two years
after a determination, if any, has been made by the Authority, petition the
court before which such Action was brought or any other court of competent
jurisdiction to independently determine whether or not he or she has engaged
in misconduct which constitutes a Breach of Duty and is, therefore, entitled
to indemnification under the provisions of this Article VI. Such court shall
thereupon have the exclusive authority to make such determination unless and
until such court dismisses or otherwise terminates such proceeding without
having made such determination. An Executive may petition a court under this
Section 4 either to seek an initial determination by the court as authorized
by Section 3d of this Article VI or to seek review by the court of a previous
adverse determination by the Authority.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | The court shall make its independent determination
irrespective of any prior  determination made by the Authority; provided,
however, that there shall exist a rebuttable presumption that the Executive
has not engaged in misconduct which  constitutes a Breach of Duty and is,
therefore, entitled to indemnification  hereunder. The burden of rebutting
such presumption by clear and convincing  evidence shall be on the
Corporation.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | c.  | In the event the court determines that an Executive has
engaged in misconduct  which constitutes a Breach of Duty, it may nonetheless
order indemnification to  be paid by the Corporation if it determines that
the Executive is fairly and  reasonably entitled to indemnification in view
of all of the circumstances of  such Action.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | d.  | In the event the Corporation does not:   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (1)  | Advance Expenses to the Executive within ten days of
such ExecutiveÂ’s  compliance with Section 2 of this Article VI; or   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (2)  | Indemnify an Executive with respect to requested
Expenses under Section 1b of this Article VI within ten days of such
ExecutiveÂ’s written request therefor, the Executive may petition the court
before which such Action was brought, if any, or any other court of competent
jurisdiction to order the  Corporation to pay such reasonable Expenses
immediately. Such court, after  giving any notice it considers necessary,
shall order the Corporation to pay  such Expenses if it determines that the
Executive has complied with the  applicable provisions of Section 2 of this
Article VI or 1b of this  Article VI, as the case may be.   
---|---|--- 
   
     that the Executive is  entitled to be indemnified for any Liabilities and/or
Expenses, or to the  advance of Expenses, unless otherwise ordered by such
court, the Corporation  shall pay such Liabilities and/or Expenses to the
Executive (net of all  Expenses, if any, previously advanced to the Executive
pursuant to  Section 2 of this Article VI), including interest thereon as
provided  in Section 6c of this Article VI, or to such other person or
entity as the Executive may designate in writing to the Corporation, within
ten days  of the rendering of such determination.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | f.  | An Executive shall pay all Expenses incurred by such
Executive in connection with the judicial determination provided in this
Section 4, unless it shall ultimately be determined by the court that he or
she is entitled, in whole or in part, to be indemnified by, or to receive an
advance from, the Corporation as authorized by this Article VI. All Expenses
incurred by an Executive in connection with any subsequent appeal of the
judicial determination provided for in this Section 4 shall be paid by the
Executive regardless of the disposition of such appeal.   
---|---|--- 
   
     5\.  | Termination of an Action is Nonconclusive   
---|--- 
   
       |  The adverse termination of any Action against an Executive
by judgment, order settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of no contest or
its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Executive
has engaged in misconduct which constitutes a Breach of Duty.   
---|--- 
   
     6\.  | Partial Indemnification; Reasonableness; Interest   
---|--- 
   
       | a.  | If it is determined by the Authority, or by a court,
that an Executive is entitled to indemnification as to some claims, issues,
or matters, but not as to other claims, issues, or matters, involved in any
Action, the Authority, or the  court, shall authorize the proration and
payment by the Corporation of such  Liabilities and/or reasonable Expenses
with respect to which indemnification is  sought by the Executive, among such
claims, issues, or matters as the Authority, or the court, shall deem
appropriate in light of all of the circumstances of such Action.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | If it is determined by the Authority, or by a court,
that certain Expenses  incurred by or on behalf of an Executive are for
whatever reason unreasonable in amount, the Authority, or the court, shall
nonetheless authorize indemnification to be paid by the Corporation to the
Executive for such Expenses as the Authority, or the court, shall deem
reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Action.   
---|---|--- 
   
     Executive, to the extent deemed  appropriate by the Authority, or by a court,
at a reasonable interest rate, for  amounts for which the Corporation
indemnifies or advances to the Executive.   
---|---|--- 
   
     7\.  | Insurance; Subrogation   
---|--- 
   
       | a.  | The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was an Executive of the Corporation, and/or is
or was serving as an  Executive of an Affiliate, against Liabilities and/or
Expenses asserted against  him or her and/or incurred by or on behalf of him
or her in any such capacity,  or arising out of his or her status as such an
Executive, whether or not the  Corporation would have the power to indemnify
him or her against such  Liabilities and/or Expenses under this Article VI or
under the Statute as  it may then be in effect. Except as expressly provided
herein, the purchase and  maintenance of such insurance shall not in any way
limit or affect the rights  and obligations of the Corporation and/or any
Executive under this  Article VI. Such insurance may, but need not, be for
the benefit of all  Executives of the Corporation and those serving as an
Executive of an Affiliate.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | If an Executive shall receive payment from any
insurance carrier or from the  plaintiff in any Action against such Executive
in respect of indemnified amounts after payments on account of all or part of
such indemnified amounts have been made by the Corporation pursuant to this
Article VI, such Executive shall promptly reimburse the Corporation for the
amount, if any, by which the sum of such payment by such insurance carrier or
such plaintiff and payments by the Corporation to such Executive exceeds such
indemnified amounts; provided, however, that such portions, if any, of such
insurance proceeds that are required to be reimbursed to the insurance
carrier under the terms of its  insurance policy, such as deductible,
retention, or co-insurance amounts, shall  not be deemed to be payments to
such Executive hereunder.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | c.  | Upon payment of indemnified amounts under this Article
VI, the Corporation  shall be subrogated to such ExecutiveÂ’s rights against
any insurance  carrier in respect of such indemnified amounts and the
Executive shall execute  and deliver any and all instruments and/or documents
and perform any and all  other acts or deeds which the Corporation shall deem
necessary or advisable to  secure such rights. The Executive shall do nothing
to prejudice such rights of  recovery or subrogation.   
---|---|--- 
   
     8\.  | Witness Expenses   
---|--- 
   
     reasonable Expenses incurred by or on behalf of an Executive in connection
with his or her appearance as a witness in any Action at a time when he or
she has not been formally named a defendant or respondent to such an Action,
within ten days after the receipt of an ExecutiveÂ’s written request therefor.
  
---|--- 
   
     9\.  | Contribution   
---|--- 
   
       | a.  | Subject to the limitations of this Section 9, if the
indemnity provided for in Section 1 of this Article VI is unavailable to an
Executive for any  reason whatsoever, the Corporation, in lieu of
indemnifying the Executive, shall contribute to the amount incurred by or on
behalf of the Executive, whether for Liabilities and/or for reasonable
Expenses in connection with any Action in such proportion as deemed fair and
reasonable by the Authority, or by a court, in light of all of the
circumstances of any such Action, in order to reflect:   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (1)  | The relative benefits received by the Corporation and
the Executive as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause
to such Action; and/or   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (2)  | The relative fault of the Corporation (and its other
Executives, employees, and/or agents) and the Executive in connection with
such event(s) and/or  transaction(s).   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b.  | The relative fault of the Corporation (and its other
Executives, employees, and/or agents), on the one hand, and of the Executive,
on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
the partiesÂ’ relative  intent, knowledge, access to information, and
opportunity to correct or prevent  the circumstances resulting in such
Liabilities and/or Expenses. The Corporation agrees that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by
pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the foregoing equitable considerations.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | c.  | An Executive shall not be entitled to contribution from
the Corporation under this Section 9 in the event it is determined by the
Authority, or by a court, that the Executive has engaged in misconduct which
constitutes a Breach of Duty.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | d.  | The CorporationÂ’s payment of, and an ExecutiveÂ’s right
to, contribution under this Section 9 shall be made and determined in
accordance with and pursuant to the provisions in Sections 3 and/or 4 of this
Article VI relating to the CorporationÂ’s payment of, and the ExecutiveÂ’s
right to, indemnification under this Article VI.   
---|---|--- 
   
      ---|--- 
   
       |  Unless otherwise specifically set forth in this Article VI,
the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless any person who is or was a
party, or is threatened to be made a party to any Action by reason of his or
her status as, or the fact that he or she is or was an employee or authorized
agent or representative of the Corporation and/or an Affiliate as to acts
performed in the course and within the scope of such employeeÂ’s, agentÂ’s, or
representativeÂ’s duties to the Corporation and/or an Affiliate, in
accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted by the Statute as it may
then be in effect.   
---|--- 
   
     11\.  | Severability   
---|--- 
   
       |  If any provision of this Article VI shall be deemed invalid
or inoperative, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any
of the provisions of this Article VI contravene public policy, this Article
VI shall be construed so that the remaining provisions shall not be affected,
but shall remain in full force and effect, and any such provisions which are
invalid or inoperative or which contravene public policy shall be deemed,
without further Action or deed by or on behalf of the Corporation, to
be modified, amended, and/or limited, but only to the extent necessary to
render the same valid and enforceable, and the Corporation shall indemnify an
Executive as to Liabilities and reasonable Expenses with respect to any
Action to the full extent permitted by any applicable provision of this
Article VI that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent
otherwise permitted by the Statute as it may then be in effect.   
---|--- 
   
     12\.  | Nonexclusivity of Article VI   
---|--- 
   
       |  The right to indemnification, contribution, and advancement
of Expenses provided to an Executive by this Article VI shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to indemnification, contribution, and/or
advancement of Expenses which any Executive or other employee or agent of the
Corporation and/or of an Affiliate may be entitled under any charter
provision, written agreement, resolution, vote of shareholders
or disinterested directors of the Corporation or otherwise, including,
without limitation, under the Statute as it may then be in effect, both as to
acts in his or her official capacity as such Executive or other employee or
agent of the Corporation and/or of an Affiliate or as to acts in any other
capacity while holding such office or position, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify, contribute, and/or advance
Expenses to the Executive under this Article VI or under the
Statute; provided that it is not determined that the Executive or other
employee or agent has engaged in misconduct which constitutes a Breach of
Duty.   
---|--- 
   
     13\.  | Notice to the Corporation; Defense of Actions   
---|--- 
   
     writing upon being served  with or having actual knowledge of any citation,
summons, complaint, indictment, or any other similar document relating to any
Action which may result in a claim of indemnification, contribution, or
advancement of Expenses hereunder, but the omission so to notify the
Corporation will not relieve the Corporation from any liability which it may
have to the Executive otherwise than under this Article VI unless the
Corporation shall have been irreparably prejudiced by such omission.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | b. | With respect to any such Action as to which an Executive
notifies the Corporation of the commencement thereof:   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (1) | The Corporation shall be entitled to participate
therein at its own expense; and   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (2)  | Except as otherwise provided below, to the extent that
it may wish, the Corporation (or any other indemnifying party, including any
insurance carrier, similarly notified by the Corporation or the Executive)
shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel selected by the
Corporation (or such other indemnifying party) and reasonably satisfactory to
the Executive.   
---|---|--- 
   
       | c.  | After notice from the Corporation (or such other
indemnifying party) to the Executive of its election to assume the defense of
an Action, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Executive under this
Article VI for any Expenses  subsequently incurred by the Executive in
connection with the defense thereof  other than reasonable costs of
investigation or as otherwise provided below. The Executive shall have the
right to employ his or her own counsel in such Action but the Expenses of
such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation (or such other
indemnifying party) of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the
expense of the Executive unless:   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (1)  | The employment of counsel by the Executive has been
authorized by the Corporation;   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (2)  | The Executive shall have reasonably concluded that
there may be a conflict of  interest between the Corporation (or such other
indemnifying party) and the  Executive in the conduct of the defense of such
Action; or   
---|---|--- 
   
       | (3)  | The Corporation (or such other indemnifying party)
shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Action,
in each of which cases the Expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the
Corporation. The Corporation shall not be entitled to assume the defense of
any Derivative Action or any Action as to which the Executive shall have made
the conclusion provided for in clause (2) above.   
---|---|--- 
   
     ---|--- 
   
       |  The terms and provisions of this Article VI shall continue
as to an Executive subsequent to the Termination Date and such terms and
provisions shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, estate, executors, and
administrators of such Executive and the successors and assigns of the
Corporation, including, without limitation, any successor to the Corporation
by way of merger, consolidation, and/or sale or disposition of all
or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the Corporation.
Except as provided herein, all rights and obligations of the Corporation and
the Executive hereunder shall continue in full force and effect despite the
subsequent amendment or modification of the CorporationÂ’s Articles of
Incorporation, as such are in effect on the date hereof, and such rights and
obligations shall not be affected by any such amendment or modification, any
resolution of directors or shareholders of the Corporation, or by any other
corporate action which conflicts with or purports to amend, modify, limit,
or eliminate any of the rights or obligations of the Corporation and/or of
the Executive hereunder.   
---|--- 
   
   

15\. Amendment

       |  This Article VI may only be altered, amended, or repealed by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Corporation so

amendment:

shall have a prospective effect only.

    EXHIBIT C

   

 _Form of Affiliate Letter_

   

Dear Sirs:

   

 The undersigned refers to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") dated as of July 8, 2006, among WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation, WEDGE ACQUISITION CORP., an Illinois corporation, and PEOPLES ENERGY CORPORATION, an Illinois corporation. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this letter have the meanings give such terms in the Merger Agreement. 

   

 The undersigned, a holder of shares of Company Common Stock, is entitled to receive in connection with the Merger shares of Parent Common Stock. The undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 (" _Rule 145_") promulgated under the Securities Act, although nothing contained herein should be construed as an admission of such fact. 

   

 If in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the Securities Act, the undersignedÂ’s ability to sell, assign or transfer the Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless much transaction is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. The undersigned (i) understands that such exemptions are limited and that Parent is not under any obligation to effect any such registration and (ii) has obtained advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act. 

   

 The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Parent that the undersigned will not sell, assign or transfer any of the Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in a transaction that meets the requirements of Rule 145 or (iii) in a transaction that, in the opinion of counsel to the undersigned, such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and such opinion to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the SEC specifically issued with respect to a transaction to be engaged in by the undersigned, is not required to be registered under the Securities Act. 

   

 In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned pursuant to Rule 145 of Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in the Merger, the undersigned will supply Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of a letter in the form of Annex I hereto and the opinion of counsel or no-action letter referred to above. The undersigned understands that Parent may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any Parent Common Stock disposed of by the undersigned, but that upon receipt of such evidence of compliance the transfer agent shall effectuate the transfer of the Parent Common Stock sold as indicated in the letter. 

       

* * *

    

 The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Parent Common Stock issued to the undersigned will all be in certificated form and (ii) appropriate legends will be placed on certificates representing Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in the merger or held by a transferee thereof, which legends will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates upon receipt of an opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent from counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such legends are no longer required for purposes of the Securities Act or in the event of a sale of the Parent Common Stock issued to the undersigned which has been registered under the Securities Act. 

   

 The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the receipt by Parent of this letter is an inducement to ParentÂ’s obligations to consummate the Merger. 

       |  Very truly yours,
