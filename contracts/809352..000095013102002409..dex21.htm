 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 17, 2002 (the "Agreement"),
between MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BANCSHARES, INC., a Missouri corporation
(the "Seller") and MARSHALL and ILSLEY CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation
(the "Company").



WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Seller have each
determined that it is fair to and in the best interests of their respective
shareholders for the Seller to merge with and into the Company (the "Merger")
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in
accordance with The General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri (the
"GBCLM") and the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the "WBCL"); 



WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and the Seller have
each approved the Merger of the Seller with and into the Company, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and adopted this
Agreement;



WHEREAS, subsequent to the Sellers approval of this Agreement and
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and an
inducement to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement,
the Company has entered into a Shareholder Voting Agreement pursuant to which
each shareholder listed on Schedule I to such Shareholder Voting Agreement has
agreed to vote the shares of Seller Common Stock beneficially owned by such
shareholder in favor of the Merger; and



WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement
shall constitute the plan of reorganization.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:



ARTICLE ITHE MERGER



SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the GBCLM, the WBCL and the
Plan of Merger attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.1_ , at the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 1.2) Seller shall be merged with and into the Company. As a
result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Seller shall cease
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation").



SECTION 1.2 _The Closing; Effective Time_.



(a) The closing of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Closing") shall be held at such time, date and location as may be mutually
agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Closing shall be
held at the offices of Godfrey and Kahn, S.C., 780 North Water Street,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, commencing at 9:00 a.m. on a date

 

1 specified by either party upon 10 business days written notice (or at the
election of the Company on the last business day of the month) after the last
to occur of the following events: (a) receipt of all consents and approvals of
government regulatory authorities legally required to consummate the Merger
and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (b) approval of
this Agreement and the Merger by the Sellers shareholders. Scheduling or
commencing the Closing shall not constitute a waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VII by either the Company or the Seller.



(b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger or summary
articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") and any other required documents
with the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri (the "Missouri Secretary
of State") and the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of
Wisconsin (the "DFI"), in such form as required by, and executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of, the GBCLM and the WBCL (the date and time of
such filing is referred to herein as the "Effective Time").



SECTION 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the GBCLM and the WBCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise
provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and the Seller shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and the Seller shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



SECTION 1.4 _Articles of Incorporation; By Laws_. At the Effective Time,
the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the Company (the "Company
Articles") and the ByLaws, as amended, of the Company (the "Company
ByLaws"), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Articles of Incorporation and the ByLaws of the Surviving Corporation.



SECTION 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, the directors
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the Articles of Incorporation and ByLaws of the Surviving Corporation
and to be assigned to the class previously assigned. At the Effective Time,
the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed.



SECTION 1.6 _Conversion of Securities; Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Subject to Section 1.6(e) regarding fractional shares, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without action on the part of the Company or
the Seller, each share of the common stock, $1.00 par value of the Seller
("Seller Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than shares of Seller Common Stock held in the treasury
of Seller or owned by the Company and any Company Subsidiary for its own
account and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.6(f)) (such
shares of Seller

 

2 Common Stock being referred to herein as the "Shares"), shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be converted into the right to receive, at the election
of the holder thereof as provided in Section 1.7, either:



(i) that number of shares of Company Common Stock which is equal to the Per
Share Stock Consideration; or



(ii) cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration; or



(iii) $26.25 in cash and that number of shares of Company Common Stock
which is equal to the product of the Per Share Stock Consideration and the
Stock Percentage;

 



provided, however, that, the aggregate amount of cash that shall be paid in
the Merger (subject to rounding) shall be equal to the product of (x) $26.25
and (y) the number of Shares (the "Cash Amount") and the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock (subject to rounding) that shall be issued in
the Merger shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (i)
the Aggregate Consideration minus the Cash Amount by (ii) the Valuation
Period Market Value (the "Stock Amount").



(b) Each share of Seller Common Stock held by the Seller as treasury stock
and each such share held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof as otherwise provided in this Section 1.6.



(c) For purposes of this Agreement, all share exchange figures and the
Valuation Period Market Values reflect the Companys stock dividend effective
with the beginning of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on
June 17, 2002 and the following definitions shall apply:



(i) "Per Share Cash Consideration" means the sum of $26.25 and an amount
equal to the product of (A) the Valuation Period Market Value and (B) a number
of shares of Company Common Stock (rounded to the nearest ten thousandth of a
share) determined as follows:



(I) If the Valuation Period Market Value is less than $23.44, the number
of shares of Company Common Stock shall be equal to 1.0116;



(II) If the Valuation Period Market Value is equal to or greater than
$23.44 but less than $27.94, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing $23.71 by the Valuation
Period Market Value;



(III) If the Valuation Period Market Value is equal to or greater than
$27.94 but less than $33.94, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
shall be equal to 0.8486;

 

3 (IV) If the Valuation Period Market Value is equal to or greater than
$33.94 but less than $38.44, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing $28.80 by the Valuation
Period Market Value; and



(V) If the Valuation Period Market Value is equal to or greater than
$38.44, the number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be equal to
0.7492.



(ii) "Aggregate Consideration" means an amount equal to the product of the
Shares and the Per Share Cash Consideration.



(iii) "Cash Percentage" means an amount equal to the quotient determined by
dividing $26.25 by the Per Share Cash Consideration.



(iv) "Per Share Stock Consideration" means an amount equal to the quotient
determined by dividing Per Share Cash Consideration by the Valuation Period
Market Value.



(v) "Stock Percentage" means an amount equal to one minus the Cash
Percentage.



(vi) "Valuation Period Market Value" means the average of the average daily
high and low sale price per share of the Company Common Stock on the NYSE for
the five (5) trading days ending on and including the third trading day
preceding the Effective Time (as reported in an authoritative source).



(d) Election forms and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates theretofore representing
Shares ("Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to a bank or trust company designated by the Company (the
"Exchange Agent")) in such form as the Company and Seller shall mutually agree
("Election Forms") shall be mailed 30 days prior to the anticipated Effective
Time or on such other earlier date as Seller and Company shall mutually agree
(the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of Shares as of five business
days prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date").



Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through
appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) either (i) to elect
to receive only Company Common Stock with respect to such holders Shares
("Stock Election Shares"); (ii) to elect to receive only cash with respect to
such holders Shares ("Cash Election Shares"); (iii) to elect to receive
Company Common Stock and cash in the proportion described in subparagraph (a)
below with respect to such holders Shares ("Mixed Election Shares"); or (iv)
to indicate that such holder makes no election ("No Election Shares"). No
Election Shares shall be deemed to be Stock Election Shares.



Any Shares with respect to which the holder (or the beneficial owner, as the
case may be) shall not have submitted to the Exchange Agent an effective,
properly completed Election Form

 

4 on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 27th day following the
Mailing Date (or such other time and date as Company and Seller may mutually
agree) (the "Election Deadline") shall also be deemed to be "No Election
Shares."



The Company shall make available Election Forms to all persons who become
holders (or beneficial owners) of Shares between the Election Form Record Date
and the close of business on the business day prior to the Election
Deadline, and Seller shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.



Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only
if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all Shares covered by
such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials
included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by
the person submitting such Election Form at or prior to the Election Deadline.
In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the
Shares represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares and
the Company shall cause the Certificates to be promptly returned without
charge to the person submitting the Election Form upon written request to
that effect from the person who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall
have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or
change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects
in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither the Company
nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of
any defect in an Election Form.



Within three business days after the Election Deadline, unless the Effective
Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as practicable,
the Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the
holders of Shares of rights to receive Company Common Stock or cash in the
Merger in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:



(i) Each of the Mixed Election Shares shall be converted into a right to
receive a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the Per Share
Stock Consideration multiplied by the Stock Percentage and $26.25 in cash.



(ii) If the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be issued
upon conversion in the Merger of the Stock Election Shares and the Mixed
Election Shares is less than the Stock Amount, then: (i) each of the Stock
Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the Per Share
Stock Consideration, (ii) each of the Cash Election Shares will be converted
into the right to receive a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to
the quotient of (m) the Stock Amount less the shares of Company Common Stock
allocated pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b)(i) above divided by (n) the
number of Cash Election Shares, plus cash in an amount equal to the

 

5 quotient of (x) the Cash Amount less the cash allocated pursuant to (a) above
divided by (y) the number of Cash Election Shares.



(iii) If the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be issued
upon the conversion in the Merger of the Stock Election Shares and the Mixed
Election Shares is greater than the Stock Amount, then: (i) each of the Cash
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive cash equal to the
Per Share Cash Consideration, (ii) each of the Stock Election Shares will be
converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Company Common Stock
equal to the quotient of (m) the Stock Amount less the shares of Company
Common Stock allocated pursuant to (a) above divided by (n) the number of
Stock Election Shares, plus an amount of cash equal to the quotient of (x) the
Cash Amount less the amount of cash allocated pursuant to (a) and (c)(i) above
divided by (y) the number of Stock Election Shares.



(e) No fractional shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued in
the Merger. In lieu of a fractional share of Company Common Stock, the holder
of any Shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional share
shall be entitled to receive cash, without interest, in an amount determined
by multiplying the Per Share Cash Consideration by the fraction of a share of
Company Common Stock to which the holder would otherwise have been entitled.
As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent
shall so notify the Company, and the Company shall deposit that amount with
the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to
the holders of fractional share interests, subject to and in accordance with
the terms of this Section 1.6.



(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Seller Common Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by shareholders who have validly exercised
dissenters rights available under Section 351.455 of the GBCLM (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and/or Per Share Stock
Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.6, unless and until such
holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost their dissenters rights under the GBCLM. Dissenting Shares shall be
treated in accordance with Section 351.455 of the GBCLM, if and to the extent
applicable. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to dissent, such holders shares of
Seller Common Stock shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable
only for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Cash
Consideration and/or Per Share Stock Consideration in accordance with this
Section 1.6. Seller shall give the Company (a) prompt notice of each and every
notice of a shareholders intent to demand payment for the shareholders
shares of Seller Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the GBCLM and received by the Seller
relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as
provided in Section 351.455 of the GBCLM and (b) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
GBCLM. Seller shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
Company, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, offer to settle or
settle, or approve any withdrawal of any demands for "fair value" under
Section 351.455 of the GBCLM.

 

6 (g) If either the tax opinion referred to in Section 7.2(e) or the tax
opinion referred to in Section 7.3(d) cannot be rendered because the counsel
charged with providing such opinion reasonably determines that the Merger may
not satisfy the continuity of interest requirements under applicable
federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations under Section
368(a) of the Code, then the Company shall reduce the Cash Amount and
correspondingly increase the Stock Amount to the minimum extent necessary to
enable the relevant tax opinions to be rendered.



SECTION 1.7 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. The Company shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, from time to time, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article I, through the
Exchange Agent, the Per Share Cash Consideration and/or Per Share Stock
Consideration, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, if any, to be issued in exchange for Shares pursuant to this Article
I (the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for
outstanding Shares. Such deposits shall be made after the Effective Time
as requested by the Exchange Agent in order for the Exchange Agent to
promptly deliver the Per Share Cash Consideration and/or Per Share Stock
Consideration.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration and/or Per Share Stock Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as the Company may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share Cash Consideration and/or Per
Share Stock Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Per Share Cash Consideration and/or Per Share Stock Consideration
and any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as provided in this Article
I, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article I (after taking into
account all Shares then held by such holder), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Seller, a transferee may exchange the Certificate representing such Shares for
the Per Share Cash Consideration and/or Per Share Stock Consideration and
any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as provided in this Article I
if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as the Company may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it or the Exchange Agent with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Cash Consideration and/or Per Share
Stock

 

7 Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as provided
in this Article I, which such holder would have had the right to receive in
respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 1.7, each Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Shares owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Per Share Cash Consideration and/or Per Share Stock
Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as provided
in this Article I.



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Company Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.6(b),
until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Company Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect
to a fractional share of Company Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Company Common Stock.



(d) _No Further Rights in the Shares._ The Per Share Cash Consideration
and/or Per Share Stock Consideration issued and paid upon conversion of the
Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.



(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the former shareholders of Seller for six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company, upon demand, and
any former shareholders of Seller who have not theretofore complied with this
Article I shall thereafter look only to the Company to claim the Per Share
Cash Consideration and/or Per Share Stock Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Company Common Stock and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Company Common Stock, in each case without interest thereon,
and subject to Section 1.7(g).



(f) _No Liability_. Neither the Company nor the Seller shall be liable to
any former holder of Shares for any such Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash or other payment delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



(g) _Withholding Rights._ The Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any former holder of Shares such amounts as the Company is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of

 

8 such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the former holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Company. 



SECTION 1.8 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Seller shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Seller Common Stock thereafter on the
records of Seller. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
certificates evidencing ownership of shares of Seller Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by
law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to
the Exchange Agent or the Company for any reason shall be converted into the
Per Share Cash Consideration and/or Per Share Stock Consideration in
accordance with this Article I, subject to applicable law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

 



SECTION 1.9 _Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters_. If prior to the
Effective Time, (i) Seller shall declare a stock dividend or distribution
upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine the Seller Common Stock, or
declare a dividend or make a distribution on the Seller Common Stock in any
security convertible into Seller Common Stock, or (ii) Company shall declare
a stock dividend or distribution upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or
combine the Company Common Stock or declare a dividend or make a distribution
on the Company Common Stock in any security convertible into Company Common
Stock, appropriate adjustment or adjustments will be made to the Per Share
Stock Consideration.



SECTION 1.10 _Company Common Stock_. The shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
unaffected by the Merger and at the Effective Time, such shares shall remain
issued and outstanding.



ARTICLE IIREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 



Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by Seller to the
Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Seller Disclosure
Schedule"), which shall identify exceptions by specific Section references,
Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Company that:



SECTION 2.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.



(a) Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Missouri, and is a registered
bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(the "BHCA"). Each subsidiary of Seller (a "Seller Subsidiary," or
collectively the "Seller Subsidiaries") is a state banking
association, corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership,
charitable foundation or trust duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation or organization.
Each of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power
and authority and is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders
("Seller Approvals") necessary to own, __

 

9 lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, including appropriate authorizations from the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Missouri Division of Finance,
the Illinois Office of Banks and Real Estate, the Arizona State Banking
Department and the U.S. Small Business Administration, and neither Seller nor
any Seller Subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings relating to the
revocation or modification of any Seller Approvals, except in each case where
the revocations or modifications, the failure to be so organized, existing and
in good standing or to have such power, authority and Seller Approvals would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 2.1(d)) on Seller and Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary conducts any trust
operations.



(b) Seller and each Seller Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or
licensed and in good standing that would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or Seller Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.



(c) A true and complete list of all of the Seller Subsidiaries, together
with (i) the Sellers percentage ownership of each Seller Subsidiary and (ii)
laws under which the Seller Subsidiary is incorporated or organized is set
forth on Annex A. Except as set forth on Annex A, Seller and/or one or more of
the Seller Subsidiaries owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each of the Seller
Subsidiaries. Except for the subsidiaries set forth on Annex A or as set forth
in Section 2.1(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller does not directly
or indirectly own any equity or similar interests in, or any interests
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business
association or entity other than in the ordinary course of business, and in
no event in excess of 5% of the outstanding equity securities of such entity.



(d) As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means,
with respect to the Company or the Seller, as the case may be, any effect that
(i) is material and adverse to the business, assets, liabilities, results of
operations or financial condition of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(as defined in Section 3.1(a)) taken as whole or the Seller and Seller
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, respectively, or (ii) materially impairs the
ability of the Company or Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not
be deemed to include the impact of (a) actions contemplated by this Agreement,
(b) changes in laws and regulations or interpretations thereof that are
generally applicable to the banking industry, (c) changes in generally
accepted accounting principles that are generally applicable to the banking
industry, (d) reasonable expenses incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, and (e) changes attributable to or
resulting from changes in general economic conditions affecting banks or their
holding companies generally provided, further, however, that none of the
following shall be deemed (either alone or in combination) to constitute, and
none of the following shall be taken

 

10 into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Seller: (a) any change in the market price
or trading volume of the Sellers Common Stock; (b) the payment of any amounts
due to, or the provision of any other benefits to, any officers or employees
under employment contracts, non-competition agreements, employee
benefit plans, severance agreements or other arrangements in existence as of
the date of or contemplated by this Agreement; (c) the taking of any action by
the Seller approved or consented to in writing by the Company; or (d) any
action taken or not taken by the Company in accordance with the terms and
covenants contained in this Agreement.



(e) The minute books of the Seller and each of the Seller Subsidiaries
contain true, complete and accurate records in all material respects of all
meetings and other corporate actions held or taken since January 1, 1997, of
their respective shareholders and Boards of Directors (including committees of
their respective Boards of Directors).



SECTION 2.2 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_. Seller has heretofore
furnished to the Company a complete and correct copy of the Articles of
Incorporation and the By-Laws, as amended or restated, of Seller ("Seller
Articles" and "Seller By-Laws," respectively") and the Articles of
Incorporation and the By-Laws, or other organizational documents, as the case
may be, of each Seller Subsidiary (the "Subsidiary Organizational
Documents"). The Seller Articles, the Seller By-Laws and the Subsidiary
Organizational Documents are in full force and effect. Neither Seller nor any
Seller Subsidiary is in violation of any of the provisions of the Seller
Articles, the Seller By-Laws or the Subsidiary Organizational Documents.



SECTION 2.3 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Seller
consists of 30,000,000 shares of Seller Common Stock and 100,000 shares of
Sellers preferred stock, $1.00 par value ("Seller Preferred Stock"). As of
the date of this Agreement, (i) 9,485,912 shares of Seller Common Stock are
issued and outstanding, all of which are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable, and not issued in violation of any preemptive
right of any Seller shareholder, (ii) 733,200 shares of Seller Common Stock
are held in the treasury of Seller, (iii) no shares of Seller Preferred Stock
are issued and outstanding, and (iv) 664,650 shares of Seller Common Stock are
subject to outstanding stock options issued pursuant to Sellers stock option
plans. The authorized capital stock of MVBI Capital Trust consists of 18,480
shares of voting common stock (the "MVBI Common Stock") and 598,000 shares of
Floating Rate Cumulative Trust Preferred Securities (the "TRUPs"). As of the
date of this Agreement, (i) 18,480 shares of the MVBI Common Stock are issued
and outstanding, all of which are duly authorized validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and owned by the Seller, and (ii) 598,000 TRUPs are issued
and outstanding, all of which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and not issued in violation of any preemptive rights of any
Seller shareholder of holder of TRUPs. Except as set forth in clause (iv),
above, there are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character, including, without limitation,
voting agreements or arrangements, relating to the issued or unissued capital
stock or other equity interests of Seller or, except as set forth in Section
2.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, any Seller Subsidiary or obligating
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock
or other equity interests of, or other equity interests in, Seller or any
Seller Subsidiary. There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares of Seller Common Stock or the

 

11 capital stock or other equity interests of any Seller Subsidiary or to provide
funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution
or otherwise) in any Seller Subsidiary or any other entity, except for loan
commitments and other funding obligations entered into in the ordinary course
of business. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of each Seller Subsidiary are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and not in violation of any preemptive
rights of any Seller Subsidiary shareholder or other equity holder, and such
shares or other equity interests owned by Seller or another Seller Subsidiary
are owned free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges,
agreements, limitations of Sellers voting rights, charges or other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. 



SECTION 2.4 _Authority_. Seller has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than,
with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by
Sellers shareholders in accordance with the GBCLM and the Seller Articles
and Seller By-Laws). The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller
and the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action,
including, without limitation, Sellers Board of Directors, and the Sellers
Board of Directors has directed that this Agreement and the consummation by
the Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be submitted to a
vote of the Sellers shareholders, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Seller are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions so contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger,
the approval and adoption of this Agreement by Sellers shareholders in
accordance with the GBCLM and the Seller Articles and Seller By-Laws). This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Seller and assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Company, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms,
except as enforcement may be limited by laws affecting insured depository
institutions, general principles of equity whether applied in a court of law
or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally.



SECTION 2.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents._



(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller do not, and the
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
by Seller shall not, (i) conflict with or violate the Seller Articles or
Seller By-Laws or the Subsidiary Organizational Documents, (ii) conflict with
or violate any domestic (federal, state or local) or foreign law, statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (collectively, "Laws")
applicable to Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or by which its or any of their
respective properties is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of
or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or encumbrance on any of the properties or assets of
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is a party
or by which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or its or any of their respective
properties is bound or affected, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii)
for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences
that

 

 

12 would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Sections 351.407 and
351.459 of the GBCLM are inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. No other "business combination," "control
share acquisition," "fair price" or other anti-takeover laws or regulations
enacted under state or federal laws in the United States apply to the Merger,
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Article Ten of
the Seller Articles is inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller do not, and the
performance of this Agreement by Seller shall not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign, except (i)
for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), state securities or blue sky laws ("Blue
Sky Laws"), the BHCA, the banking laws and regulations of the States of
Arizona, Illinois and Missouri (the "SBL"), regulations promulgated by the
Small Business Administration (the "SBR"), the filing and recordation
of appropriate merger or other documents as required by the GBCLM and the
WBCL, and prior notification filings with the Department of Justice under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (the "HSR Act") and (ii) where the failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not prevent or delay consummation of the Merger or
otherwise prevent Seller from performing its obligations under this Agreement,
and would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or Seller
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



SECTION 2.6 _Compliance; Permits_. Except as set forth in Section 2.6 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is in
conflict with, or in default or violation of, (i) any Law applicable
to Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or by which its or any of their respective
properties is bound or affected, or (ii) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is a party or by which
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or its or any of their respective properties
is bound or affected, except for any such conflicts, defaults or violations
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Seller or Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



SECTION 2.7 _Securities and Banking Reports; Financial Statements._



(a) Seller and each Seller Subsidiary have filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed with (x) the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") since December 31, 2000, and as of the date of this Agreement has

Seller with the SEC since December 31, 1999, (iv) all other reports or

(collectively, the "Seller SEC Reports") and (y) the Federal Reserve Board,
the FDIC, the Missouri Division of Finance, the Illinois Office of Banks and
Real Estate, the Arizona State

 

13 Banking Department and any other applicable federal or state securities or
banking authorities (all such reports and statements are
collectively referred to as the "Seller Reports"). The Seller Reports,
including all Seller Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, (i) were
or will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
requirements of applicable Law and (ii) did not at the time they were filed,
or will not at the time they are filed, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Seller Reports, including
any Seller Reports filed since the date of this Agreement and prior to or on
the Effective Time, have been or will be prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and each fairly presents the consolidated financial position
of Seller and Seller Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of its operations and changes in financial position for
the periods indicated, except that any unaudited interim financial statements
were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were
not or are not expected to be material in amount.



(c) Except (i) for those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Seller included in the
Sellers Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2001, (ii) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2001, and (iii) as set forth
in Section 2.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor
any Seller Subsidiary has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise due or to become due),
that, either alone or when combined with all similar liabilities, has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller
and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



SECTION 2.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._



(a) Except as disclosed in the Seller SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this Agreement or as set forth in Section 2.8(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, since December 31, 2001 to the date of this Agreement, Seller and
the Seller Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice and, since December 31,
2001, there has not been (i) any change in the financial condition, results of

compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all material
employment, termination, severance or other employment contracts or employment

including, without limitation, and where applicable, a copy of (i) each trust
or other funding arrangement,

Title IV of ERISA ("Title IV Plan"). No Title IV Plan is a "multiemployer
pension plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. Except as disclosed in
Section 2.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, none of the Plans
obligates Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries to pay material separation,

respects in accordance with the requirements of all applicable Law and all
persons who participate in the operation of such Plans and all
Plan "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) have acted
in accordance with the provisions of all applicable Law, except where such
violations of applicable Law would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect on Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have performed all obligations
required to be performed by any of them under, are not in any respect in
default under or in violation of, and Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have
no knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any Plan, except
where such failures, defaults or violations would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No legal action, suit or claim is pending or,
to the knowledge of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, threatened with respect
to any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and,
except as disclosed in Section 2.10(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, to
the knowledge of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, no fact or event exists
that could give rise to any such action, suit or claim. Except as disclosed in
Section 2.10(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any
Seller Subsidiary has incurred any material liability under Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code that has not been satisfied in full and no
condition exists that presents a material risk of incurring any such
liability.



(d) _Qualification of Certain Plans_. Each Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code
(including each trust established in connection with such a Plan that is

Code) has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS (as defined
herein) that it is so qualified, and, except as disclosed in Section 2.10(d)
of the Seller

 

16  Disclosure Schedule, Seller is not aware of any fact or event that could
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Plan. Except as disclosed in
Section 2.10(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no trust maintained or
contributed to by the Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries is intended to
be qualified as a voluntary employees beneficiary association or is intended
to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code.



(e) _Absence of Certain Liabilities and Events_. Except for matters
disclosed in Section 2.10(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there has been
no non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Plan. Seller and each
of the Seller Subsidiaries has not incurred any liability for any excise tax
arising under Sections 4971 through 4980F of the Code that would individually
or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and, to the knowledge of Seller or the
Seller Subsidiaries, no fact or event exists that could give rise to any such
liability.



(f) _Plan Contributions_. All contributions, premiums or payments required
to be made with respect to any Plan have been made on or before their due
dates.

 



(g) _Employment Contracts_. Except for employment, severance, consulting
or other similar contracts with any employees, consultants, officers or
directors of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries disclosed in Section

Subsidiary is a party to any such contracts. Neither Seller nor any Seller
Subsidiary is a party to any collective bargaining agreements.



(h) _Effect of Agreement_. Except as disclosed in Section 2.10(h) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not, either alone or in conjunction with another
event, entitle any current or former employee of Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment,
except as expressly provided herein, or accelerate the time of payment
or vesting or increase the compensation due any such employee or former
employee, in each case, except as expressly provided herein.



SECTION 2.11 _Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus_. The
information supplied by Seller for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Registration Statement (as defined in Section 3.8) shall not at the time
the Registration Statement is declared effective contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information

with the meeting of Sellers shareholders to consider the Merger (the "Seller
Shareholders Meeting") (such proxy statement/prospectus as amended or
supplemented is referred to herein as the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus")
shall not at the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to shareholders, at the time of
the Seller Shareholders Meeting and at the Effective Time, be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact required to be stated therein,
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made

 

17 therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to
Seller or any of its affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
Seller which should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement
or a supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Seller shall promptly
inform the Company. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall comply in all
material respects as to form with the requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act (to the extent applicable) and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any information about, or supplied or omitted by, the
Company which is contained in any of the foregoing documents.

the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller and each of the Seller Subsidiaries
has good and marketable title to all of their respective properties and
assets, real and personal, free and clear of all mortgage liens, and free and
clear of all other liens, charges and encumbrances except liens for taxes not
yet due and payable, pledges to secure deposits and such minor imperfections
of title, if any, as do not materially detract from the value of or interfere
with the present use of the property affected thereby or which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller and
the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and all leases pursuant to which
Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries lease from others material amounts of
real or personal property are in good standing, valid and effective in
accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such
leases, any existing material default or event of default (or event which with
notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material default and in
respect of which the Seller or such Seller Subsidiary has not taken adequate
steps to prevent such a default from occurring). Substantially all of Sellers
and each of the Sellers Subsidiaries buildings and equipment in regular use
have been reasonably maintained and are in good and serviceable condition,
reasonable wear and tear excepted.

currently or formerly owned or operated by the Seller or any of Sellers
Subsidiaries or any Loan Property or Participation Facility or (b) to cause
any properties currently owned or operated by the Seller or any of Sellers
Subsidiaries or any Loan Property or Participation Facility to be subject to
any restrictions on ownership, occupancy, use or transferability under any
applicable Environmental Law or require notification to or consent of any
Governmental Authority or third party pursuant to any Environmental Law.

Schedule, no agreements relating to allocating or sharing of Taxes exist among
Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries and no tax indemnities given by Seller or
the Seller Subsidiaries in connection with a sale of stock or assets remain in

to any, and there are no pending or, to the best of the Companys knowledge,
threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims,

leases pursuant to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries lease
from others material amounts of real or personal property are in good
standing, valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms, and

such subsidiary has not taken adequate steps to prevent such a default from
occurring). Substantially all of the Companys and each of the Company
Subsidiaries buildings and equipment in regular use have been reasonably
maintained and are in good and serviceable condition, reasonable wear and tear

Subsidiary to:



(a) operate its business only in the usual, regular and ordinary course
consistent with past practices;

 

27 (b) use all reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business
organization and assets, maintain its rights and franchises, retain the
services of its officers and key employees and maintain its relationships with
customers;



(c) use all reasonable efforts to maintain and keep its properties in as
good repair and condition as at present, ordinary wear and tear excepted; 



(d) use commercially reasonable efforts to keep in full force and effect
insurance and bonds comparable in amount and scope of coverage to that now
maintained by it; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall not purchase new
insurance policies covering directors and officers liabilities at an
aggregate annual premium cost equal to or in excess of 250% of the current
annual premiums paid by Seller on its Directors and Officers Liability
Policy issued by The St. Paul Insurance Company (the "Existing DandO Policy");
and provided, further however, that Seller shall not renew the Existing DandO
Policy at its anniversary date unless such renewal can be made on commercially
reasonable terms;



(e) perform in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by it under all material contracts, leases, and documents relating
to or affecting its assets, properties, and business;



(f) comply with and perform in all material respects all obligations and
duties imposed upon it by all applicable Laws; and



(g) not to take any action or fail to take any action which individually
or in the aggregate can be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Seller and Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



SECTION 4.2 _Negative Covenants._ Except as specifically contemplated by
this Agreement, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
Seller shall not do, or permit any Seller Subsidiary to do, without the prior
written consent of the Company, any of the following:



(a)(i) except as required by applicable law or to maintain qualification
pursuant to the Code, and except as set forth in Section 4.2 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules adopt, amend, renew or terminate any Plan or any
agreement, arrangement, plan or policy between the Seller or any Subsidiary of
the Seller and one or more of its current or former directors, officers or
employees or (ii) except for normal increases in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, and subject to the specific
provisions of Annex B, or, except as required by applicable law, increase in
any manner the base salary, bonus, incentive compensation or fringe benefits
of any director, officer or employee or pay any benefit not required by any
plan or agreement as in effect as of the date hereof (including, without
limitation, the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance units or shares);



(b)(i) except as provided below declare or pay any dividend on, or
make any other distribution in respect of, its outstanding shares of capital
stock or limited liability company

on Seller Common Stock in or with respect to the quarter in which the
Effective Time shall occur and in which the shareholders of Seller Common

that, it is the intent of this clause (ii) to provide that the holders of
Seller Common Stock will receive either the payment of cash dividends on
their shares of Seller Common Stock or the payment of cash dividends as the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock received in exchange for the shares
of Seller Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement for the calendar quarter
during which the Effective Time shall occur, but will not receive and will not
become entitled to receive for the same calendar quarter both the payment of a
cash dividend as shareholders of Seller Common Stock and the payment of a
cash dividend as the holders of shares of Company Common Stock received in
exchange for the shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement; and
if Seller does not declare and pay cash dividends in a particular calendar
quarter because of Sellers reasonable expectation that the Effective Time was
to have occurred in such calendar quarter wherein the holders of Seller Common
Stock would have become entitled to receive cash dividends for such calendar
quarter on the shares of Company Common Stock to have been exchanged for the
shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, and the Effective
Time does not in fact occur in such calendar quarter, then, as a result
thereof, Seller shall be entitled to declare and pay a cash dividend (within
the limitations of this clause (ii)) on such shares of Seller Common Stock for
such calendar quarter by the declaration and payment of such cash dividends as
soon as reasonably practicable after the end of such calendar quarter;



(c)(i) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital

into or exchangeable for any shares of its capital stock or other equity
interests, or any options, warrants, conversion or other rights to acquire
any shares of its capital stock, other equity interests or any such securities

than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice;
(iv) liquidate, sell, dispose of, or encumber any assets or acquire any
assets, other than in the ordinary course of its business consistent with past
practice; or (v) split, combine or reclassify any of its capital stock or
other equity interests or issue or authorize or propose the issuance of any
other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of
its capital stock or other equity interests;



(d) issue, deliver, award, grant or sell, or authorize or propose the
issuance, delivery, award, grant or sale of, any shares of any class of
capital stock or other equity interests of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary
(including shares held in treasury) or any rights, warrants or options to
acquire, any such shares or other equity interests;

  

29 (e) propose or adopt any amendments to its articles of incorporation,
bylaws, articles of organization, or operating agreement, as the case may be,
in any way adverse to the Company;

or change any of its methods of reporting income or deductions for federal
income tax purposes from those employed in the preparation of the federal

may be required by Law or generally accepted accounting principles;



(g) change any lending, investment, liability management or other material
policies concerning the business or operations of Seller or any of the Seller
Subsidiaries, except as required by Law, including, without limitation: (i)

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; (iii) make any
investment with an interest maturity of five years or more, (iv) incur any

evidenced by a note, bond, debenture or similar instrument, except in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; (v) enter into any
agreement with respect to any acquisition of a material amount of assets or
securities or any discharge, waiver, satisfaction, release or relinquishment

event with a value in excess of $100,000 individually; (vi) settle any claim,

SECTION 4.3 _Letter of Seller s Accountants._ If requested in writing by
the Company, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
delivered to the Company "comfort" letters of Ernst and Young, LLP, Sellers
independent public accountants, dated the date on which the Registration

(a) Seller shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations relating to a Competing Proposal (as defined

heretofore. Seller will not, directly or indirectly, and will instruct its
directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
agents, investment bankers, advisors and other representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance), or take
any other action or facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Proposal, or enter into or maintain discussions or negotiate with any person
in furtherance of or relating to such inquiries or to obtain a Competing
Proposal, or agree to or endorse any Competing Proposal, or authorize or
permit any Representative of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries to take
any such action, and Seller shall use its best efforts to cause the
Representatives of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries not to take any such
action, and Seller shall promptly notify the Company if any such inquiries or
proposals are made regarding a Competing Proposal, and Seller shall keep the
Company informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposals; _provided, however_ , that prior to such time as the shareholders
of Seller shall have adopted and approved this Agreement in accordance with
the GBCLM, nothing contained in this Section 4.4 shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of Seller from (i), in connection with a Superior Competing
Transaction (as defined below), furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any person that makes an unsolicited bona
fide proposal to acquire Seller pursuant to a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or other similar transaction, if, and only to
the extent that, (A) the Board of Directors of Seller, after consultation
with and based upon the advice of independent legal counsel, determines in
good faith that such action is required for the Board of Directors of Seller
to comply with its fiduciary duties to shareholders imposed by Missouri law,
(B) prior to furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such person, Seller provides written notice to the Company
to the effect that is furnishing information to, or entering into discussions
or negotiations with, such person, (C) prior to furnishing such information to
such person, Seller receives from such person an executed confidentiality
agreement, and (D) Seller keeps the Company informed, on a current basis, of
the status and details of any such discussions or negotiations, or (ii)
complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act.



(b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Competing Proposal" shall mean any of
the following involving Seller or any Seller Subsidiary: any inquiry, proposal
or offer from any person relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of a business that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net
income or the assets of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of Seller or any of the
Seller Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more any class of equity
securities of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries, any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving Seller or any of the Seller
Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

31 (c) For purposes of this Agreement "Superior Competing Transaction" shall
mean any of the following involving Seller or any Seller Subsidiary: any
proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including
pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than
50% of the combined voting power of the shares of Seller Common Stock
then outstanding or all or substantially all of the assets of Seller, and
otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of Seller determines in its
good faith judgment (based on the opinion of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be more favorable to its shareholders than the
Merger and for which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or
which if not committed is, in the good faith judgment of its Board of
Directors, reasonably capable of being obtained by such third party.



SECTION 4.5 _Update Disclosure; Breaches._



(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
Seller shall update the Seller Disclosure Statement on a regular basis by
written notice to the Company to reflect any matters which have occurred from
and after the date of this Agreement which, if existing on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be described therein; provided that
(i) to the extent that any information that would be required to be included
in an update under this Section 4.5(a) would have in the past been contained
in internal reports prepared by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary in the
ordinary course, such update may occur by delivery of such internal reports
prepared in accordance with past practice, with appropriate steps taken by
Seller to identify relevant information contained therein, and (ii) to the
extent that updating required under this Section is unduly burdensome to
Seller, Seller and the Company will use their best efforts to develop
alternate updating procedures using, wherever possible, existing reporting
systems.



(b) Seller shall, in the event it becomes aware of the impending or
threatened occurrence of any event or condition which would cause or
constitute a material breach (or would have caused or constituted a material
breach had such event occurred or been known prior to the date of this
Agreement) of any of its representations or agreements contained or referred
to herein, give prompt written notice thereof to the Company and use its
reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy the same.



SECTION 4.6 _Affiliates; Tax Treatment_. Within thirty (30) days after the
date of this Agreement (a) Seller shall deliver to the Company a letter
identifying all persons who are then "affiliates" of Seller, including,
without limitation, all directors and executive officers of Seller, for
purposes of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act (each a "Seller
Affiliate") and (b) Seller shall advise the persons identified in such letter
of the resale restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws. Seller shall
use its best efforts to obtain from each person identified in such letter a
written agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 4.6.
Seller shall use its best efforts to obtain from any person who becomes an
affiliate of Seller after Sellers delivery of the letter referred to above,
on or prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement, substantially in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit 4.6 as soon as practicable after

 

32  such person attains such status. Seller will use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A)
of the Code.



SECTION 4.7 _Delivery of Shareholder List_. Seller shall arrange to have
its transfer agent deliver to the Company or its designee, from time to time
prior to the Effective Time, a true and complete list setting forth the names

latest practicable date, and such other shareholder information as the
Company may reasonably request.



SECTION 4.8 __ _Loan and Investment Policies_. __Seller agrees to
maintain and to cause the Seller Subsidiaries to maintain their existing loan
and investment policies and procedures designed to insure safe and sound
banking practices, which shall remain in effect, except as otherwise agreed
in writing by the Company, for the period prior to the Effective Time. To the
extent permitted by applicable law or regulations, such policies and
procedures shall apply to, among other matters, the following: (i) making or
renewing any commitments or loans, or purchase or renewals of any
participations in loans, in excess of an amount to be agreed upon; (ii)
making, committing to make or renewing any loan to any affiliate of Seller or
the Seller Subsidiaries or any family member of such affiliate or any entity
in which such affiliate has a material interest; (iii) making any investment
or commitment to invest, or making any loan, in excess of an amount to be
agreed with respect to any commercial real estate or in or with respect to
any commercial real estate development project; or (iv) entering into any
contract, lease, or license under which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary will
be bound to pay in excess of an amount to be agreed over the life of such
agreement or voluntarily committing any act or omission which constitutes a
breach or default by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary under any material
contract, lease or license to which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is a party
or by which it or any of its properties are bound. To the extent permitted by
applicable law or regulations, the Company shall have the right to designate
at least two (2) observers to attend all meetings of Seller s (i) senior
credit committee, or similar committee at any Seller Subsidiary designated by
the Company, and (ii) investment committee or similar committee at any Seller
Subsidiary, and Seller shall ensure that such representatives receive all
information given by Seller or its agents to Sellers members of said
committees.



SECTION 4.9 _Access and Information_. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, Seller will give the Company and its representatives,
employees, counsel and accountants reasonable access to the properties, books
and records of the Seller and any other information relating to Seller
that is reasonably requested by the Company for purpose of permitting the
Company, among other things, to: (a) conduct its due diligence review, (b)
review the financial statements of Seller, (c) verify the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, (d)
confirm compliance by Seller with the terms of this Agreement, and (e) prepare
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any investigation by the Company
pursuant to this Section 4.9 shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business and operations of Seller. The Company shall not, without the consent
of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonable withheld), contact any
customers or key employees of Seller. If the Merger contemplated hereby is not
consummated, the Company shall maintain in confidentiality all non-public and
all

 

33 proprietary information acquired by the Company from the Seller in connection
with its due diligence review.



SECTION 4.10 _Confidentiality Letters._ Seller agrees that the

ARTICLE VCOVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

agrees with Seller that prior to the Effective Time, unless the prior written
consent of Seller shall have been obtained and except as otherwise
contemplated herein, it will:



(a) maintain its corporate existence in good standing and maintain
all books and records in accordance with accounting principles and practices
as used in the Companys financial statements applied on a consistent basis;
and



(b) conduct its business in a manner that does not violate any Law, except
for possible violations which individually or in the aggregate do not, and,
insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future will not, have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.



SECTION 5.2 _Negative Covenants._ Except as set forth in Section 5.2 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, or agree to commit to, or permit any Company Subsidiaries
to, without the prior written consent of Seller, propose or adopt any
amendments to its Articles of Incorporation or By-laws in a manner which
would adversely affect in any manner the terms of the Company Common Stock or
the ability of Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or
agree in writing to do any of the foregoing; _provided,_ _however,_ that any
such amendment to the Company Articles to increase the authorized number of
shares of Company Common Stock shall not be deemed to have such an adverse
effect.



SECTION 5.3 _Breaches._ The Company shall, in the event it becomes aware
of the impending or threatened occurrence of any event or condition which
would cause or constitute a material breach (or would have caused or
constituted a material breach had such event occurred or been known prior to
the date of this Agreement) of any of its representations or agreements
contained or referred to herein, give prompt written notice thereof to the
Seller and use its best efforts to prevent or promptly remedy the same.

the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE prior to the Effective
Time.

as of May 24, 2002, shall remain in full force and effect and binding upon the

SECTION 5.7 _Stock Options_.



(a) At the Effective Time, the Company will assume the option plans listed
on Schedule 5.7(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Option Plans") and
all of the Sellers obligations thereunder. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding option issued pursuant to the Option Plans (each, an "Option")
shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Option (including, without
limitation, the time periods allowed for exercise), a number of shares of
Company Common Stock equal to the product of the Per Share Stock Consideration
and the number of shares subject to such Option (provided that any fractional
shares of Company Common Stock resulting from such calculation shall be
rounded to the nearest whole share), at a price per share equal to the
aggregate exercise price for the shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such
Option divided by the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such assumed Option.

issuance a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of the Options adjusted in accordance with this Section 5.7. The
Company shall file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) or another appropriate form, promptly after the Effective
Time, with respect to the Company Common Stock subject to such Options and

status of the related prospectus or prospectuses) for so long as such Options
remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals who subsequent to the
Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act, the Company shall administer the Option Plans assumed
pursuant to this Section 5.7 in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the Option Plans complied
with such rule prior to the Merger.



SECTION 5.8 _Directorships_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Company shall take such action as may be reasonably required to cause its
Board of Directors to be expanded by one member and to appoint Mr. Andrew N.
Baur to the class of the Companys directors with terms expiring at the
Companys 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.



ARTICLE VIADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



SECTION 6.1 _Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement_. As
promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Seller and the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
registration statement on Form S-4 promulgated under the Securities Act (or

Merger by the shareholders of Seller and shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to become effective as soon thereafter as
practicable. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the recommendation
of the Board of Directors of Seller

 

35 in favor of the Merger; _provided,_ _however,_ that in connection with the
Sellers Board of Directors recommendation to the Sellers Shareholders in
favor of a Superior Competing Transaction (as defined in Section 4.4), the
Board of Directors of Seller may, at any time prior to such time as the
shareholders of Seller shall have adopted and approved this Agreement and the
Merger in accordance with the GBCLM, withdraw, modify or change any such
recommendation to the extent Board of Directors of Seller determines in good
faith, after consultation with and based upon the advice of independent
legal counsel, that the failure to so withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation would cause the Board of Directors of Seller to breach its
fiduciary duties to Sellers shareholders under applicable Law. Any
withdrawal, modification or change of the recommendation in favor of the
Merger pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall be deemed by the parties not to
change the approval of the Board of Directors of Seller for purposes of
causing any business combination, control share acquisition, fair price or
other anti-takeover law or regulation (including, without limitation, Sections
351.407 and 351.459 of the GBCLM) to be inapplicable to the Merger and any
such withdrawal, modification or change shall not affect the Sellers
obligations in the first sentence of this Section 6.1.



SECTION 6.2 _Meeting of Seller s Shareholders._ Seller shall promptly
after the date of this Agreement take all action necessary in accordance with
the GBCLM and the Seller Articles and the Seller By-Laws to convene the Seller
Shareholders Meeting. Seller shall use its best efforts to solicit from
shareholders of Seller proxies in favor of the Merger and shall take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of shareholders
required by the GBCLM to approve the Merger, unless the Board of Directors of
Seller shall have determined in good faith based on advice of counsel that
such actions would violate its fiduciary duty to Sellers Shareholders under
applicable Law.



SECTION 6.3 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings._ Seller and the
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) obtain all
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders
required under Law (including, without limitation, all foreign and domestic
(federal, state and local) governmental and regulatory rulings and approvals
and parties to contracts) required in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by them of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the Merger,
(iii) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A)
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (to the extent applicable) and the
rules and regulations thereunder, and any other applicable federal or state
securities laws, (B) the BHCA, the SBL, the SBR and any other applicable
federal or state banking laws and (C) any other applicable Law; provided that,
the Company and Seller shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such documents
to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to
accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith. Seller and the Company shall furnish all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and
regulations of any applicable Law (including all information required to be
included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In case at
any time after the Effective Time any

 

36 further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement
shall use all reasonable efforts to take all such necessary action.



SECTION 6.4 _Employee Benefit Matters._ Annex B hereto sets forth certain
agreements with respect to Sellers employee benefit matters.



SECTION 6.5 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._



(a) By virtue of the occurrence of the Merger, the Company shall from and
after the Effective Time succeed to Sellers obligations with respect to
indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of the directors,
officers, employees and agents of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries as
provided in the Seller Articles, Seller By-Laws, indemnification agreements of
Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect as of the date of
this Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time.

similar in all respects to those currently in effect on the date of this
Agreement with respect to acts, omissions and other matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time for which coverage is provided under the Existing DandO
Policy; _provided,_ _however,_ that the Companys obligation under this
subsection (b) shall be completely satisfied at such time as the Company shall
have satisfied either of the following conditions: (i) the Company shall have
maintained the DandO Policy in accordance with this subsection (b) for a period
of three years from and after the Effective Time or (ii) the Company shall
have incurred costs to maintain insurance in accordance with this subsection
equal to or exceeding 250% of the annual premium in effect on the date of
this Agreement; provided, further however, if the Company fails to maintain
the DandO Policy in accordance with this subsection (b) for three years from the
Effective Time, the Company will indemnify and hold all present and former
directors and officers of Seller covered by the Existing DandO Policy harmless
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, attorneys fees, disbursements and court
costs) and actions with respect to acts, omissions, and other matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time for which coverage is provided under the
Existing DandO Policy to the same extent as coverage would have been provided to
such persons had the DandO Policy in accordance with this subsection (b) been
maintained by the Company for a period of three years from and after the
Effective Time.



(c) The provisions of this Section 6.5 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary (the
"Indemnified Parties") and his or her heirs and representatives.

 

37 SECTION 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters._ Seller shall give prompt
notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Seller, of
(i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-

contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate and (ii) any failure
of Seller or the Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; _provided,_ _however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 6.6 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.



SECTION 6.7 _Public Announcements._ The Company and Seller shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to the Merger and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,

federal securities laws.

shall reasonably request.

same, except that the parties shall share equally in the expense of printing
and filing the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and

herewith.

 



(b) "Expenses" as used in this Agreement shall include all reasonable out-

condition or restriction upon the Company or Seller or their respective
subsidiaries (or the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries after the
Effective Time), which would materially adversely impact the economic or
business benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in such a
manner as to render inadvisable the consummation of the Merger.

has been no Material Adverse Effect on the Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and there has not been any change in the financial

taken as a whole. The Company shall have received a certificate of the
President and the Chief Financial Officer of the Seller to that effect.

to that certain Indenture dated March 5, 1997 (the "Indenture") between the

obligation of Seller to effect the Merger is also subject to the following
conditions:

the condition contained in this clause, no effect shall be given to any
exception in such representations and warranties relating to materiality or a
Material Adverse Effect, and _provided,_ _further,_ _however,_ that, for

Company. The Seller shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company to the foregoing effect.

be made by the Company for the authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall have been obtained and made by the Company, except where the failure to
obtain any consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to
be obtained or any filings required to be made would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



(d) _Tax Opinion._ The Seller shall have received an opinion of Armstrong
Teasdale LLP, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Seller,
dated as of the Effective Time, substantially to the effect that on the basis
of facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion which are
consistent with the state of facts existing at the Effective Time, the Merger
will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and that, accordingly, for federal income tax purposes:

 

42 (i) No gain or loss will be recognized by the Seller as a result of the
Merger;

shareholders who exchange their Seller Common Stock solely for Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of
the Seller Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor (reduced by any

In rendering such opinion, the Sellers Counsel may require and rely upon
representations and covenants contained in certificates of officers of
Company, the Seller and others.



(e) _Opinion of Counsel._ Seller shall have received from Godfrey and Kahn,
S.C., or other independent counsel for the Company reasonably satisfactory to

financial condition, results of operations or business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that either individually or in the
aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Seller shall have received a certificate of
the President and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to that effect.

(i) by mutual consent of the Company and Seller by a vote of majority of
the members of the entire Board of Directors of both the Company and Seller;



(ii) by Seller or the Company (A) if there has been a breach in any
material respect (except that where any statement in a representation or
warranty expressly includes a

 

43 standard of materiality, such statement shall have been breached in any
respect) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part
of Seller, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, respectively,
set forth in this Agreement, or (B) if any representation or warranty of

shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(a)(ii) unless the breach of any representation or warranty (but not
breaches of covenants or agreements), together with all other such breaches,
would entitle the party receiving such representation or warranty not to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 7.2(a) (in the
case of a breach of a representation or warranty by the Seller) or Section
7.3(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by the

December 31, 2002 as a result of proceedings of a governmental authority or
litigation, then the date on which either the Company or the Seller may
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(a)(iv) shall be extended to
the earlier of (A) the lapse of a reasonable period of time necessary to
consummate the Merger following the final termination of proceedings of a
governmental authority or litigation or (B) March 31, 2003; 



(v) by either the Company or Seller if any of the Federal Reserve Board, the

neither the Company nor Seller has, within 30 days after the entry of such
order denying approval, filed a petition seeking review of such order as

(vi) by either the Company or the Seller, if at the Seller Shareholders
Meeting, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall fail to

Seller has withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to the Company its
approval and recommendation of this Agreement or its approval of the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated hereby or if the

 

 

44 Board of Directors of the Seller shall have approved or recommended such
Superior Competing Transaction;

(B) The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, by providing
written notice thereof to the Seller, to issue a number of shares of Company

hereof such that the sum of (I) the product obtained by multiplying (a) the
Additional Per Share Stock Consideration by (b) the Valuation Period Market
Value and (II) the dollar value of the Per Share Cash Consideration is an
amount equal to $47.93. If the Company issues the Additional Shares, the Per
Share Cash Consideration for purposes of the calculations made pursuant to
Section 1.6 shall be deemed to be $47.93.



SECTION 8.2 _Effect of Termination._ In the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease except:
(i) as set forth in Section 9.1 of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein
shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement or shall restrict either partys rights in the case thereof.



SECTION 8.3 _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors

which would reduce the amount or change the type of consideration into which
each share of Seller Common Stock shall be converted pursuant to this
Agreement upon consummation of the Merger. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.



SECTION 8.4 _Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent other
failure.

SECTION 9.4 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.



SECTION 9.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



SECTION 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights
or remedies hereunder.

 

47 SECTION 9.7 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by

State of Missouri are mandatorily applicable to the matters arising under or
in connection with this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Wisconsin, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of choice
of law or conflicts of law.

taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.



SECTION 9.11 _Time is of the Essence_. Time is of the essence of this
Agreement.



SECTION 9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge that

aggrieved party may proceed to protect its rights and enforce this Agreement
by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate proceeding, including an
action for the specific performance of any provision herein or any other
remedy granted by law, equity or otherwise. Any action for specific
performance hereunder shall not be deemed exclusive and may also include
claims for monetary damages as may be warranted under the circumstances. The
prevailing party in any such suit, action or other proceeding arising out of
or related to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its costs, including
attorneys fees, incurred in such suit, action or other proceeding.
