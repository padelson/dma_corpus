         (e)      Physical Inventory. Buyer and Seller shall, at their own
expense, cooperate in taking physical inventories of LP Gas of the Business as

Working Capital. On the Closing Date, one or more representatives of Buyer will
conduct (i) a reading of the meters and/or gauges on the bulk storage tanks,

tanks based upon Seller's perpetual records, (iii) a physical count of
regulators and copper tubing at all locations at which such items are located

Buyer and its representatives during the physical inventory as set forth in the
preceding sentence and, upon notice to Buyer, the parties shall work together to
conduct a physical inventory at each site at which Buyer performs a physical
inventory on the Closing Date.

         SECTION 3.3 PAYMENT OF ESTIMATED CASH PURCHASE PRICE.

         (a)      On the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid)
$3.1 million of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price to the escrow agent under the
Escrow Agreement to retain, for the purposes provided in this Section (the
"Holdback Amount"). To the extent that Buyer (i) is held liable for and pays for
any Excluded Liability, (ii) must satisfy any such Excluded Liability to obtain
all right, title, interest to and benefits of the Purchased Assets required to
be assigned under this Agreement, (iii) becomes entitled to indemnification of
Losses under Article X, or (iv) becomes entitled to a payment on account of a
Change in Working Capital as provided in SECTION 3.4(d), then Buyer shall be
entitled to recover a corresponding amount from the Holdback Amount as more
particularly described in the Escrow Agreement. As more particularly described
in the Escrow Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to releases of the Holdback
Amount as follows: (1) at the date that a final determination of the Closing
Date Working Capital is made, $1,000,000 minus (i) any amounts required to be
paid to Buyer as provided in SECTION 3.4(d) as result of a Change in Working
Capital; and (ii) the amount of any other claims made by Buyer against the
Holdback Amount pursuant to this SECTION 3.3(a); (2) on the date that is six (6)
months after the Closing Date, $1,000,000 minus the amount of any claims made by
Buyer against the Holdback Amount pursuant to this SECTION 3.3(a) and not
previously paid to Buyer; and (3) on December 31, 2004, if there are no
unresolved claims by Buyer against the Holdback Amount, the remaining balance of
the Holdback Amount. However, if there are any claims by Buyer against the
Holdback Amount as of December 31, 2004, the amount of such claims shall remain
in the escrow account until the claims are resolved in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement. The parties shall be entitled to
issue directions to the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement for the release
of the amounts Buyer and Seller have agreed shall be released under this
Section. The fees and expenses of the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement
shall be paid as provided in the Escrow Agreement.

         (b)      At the Closing, as directed by Seller and in accordance with
the payoff letter delivered to Buyer, Buyer shall pay REJ Propane LLC a portion
of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price equal to an aggregate amount, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, required to satisfy the liabilities and
obligations of Seller under the Credit Agreement, dated as of July 2, 2003,
between Seller and REJ Propane LLC (the "Credit Agreement"). No later than the
close of business on the last Business Day preceding the Closing Date, Seller
shall cause REJ Propane LLC to designate the accounts to which such payments
shall be made and provide wire instructions for such accounts.

         (c)      At the Closing, Buyer shall pay Seller the balance of the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
after payment of the amounts set forth in SECTION 3.3(a) and 3.3(b). Seller
shall designate, not later than the close of business on the last Business Day

         SECTION 3.4 POST-CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL CALCULATION.

         (a)      Generally.

                  (i)      If, on or before the 60th day following the Closing
         Date (the "Objection Date"), either Buyer or Seller determines that
         Closing Date Working Capital differs from Estimated Net Working
         Capital, then Buyer and/or Seller, as the case may be, shall provide
         notice of its determination to the other party on or before the
         Objection Date ("Notice of Objection"). The party receiving the Notice
         of Objection may either accept the determination set forth in the
         Notice of Objection or notify the sending party within twenty (20) days
         after receipt of the Notice of Objection that such party disputes the
         determination set forth in the Notice of Objection. If the party
         receiving a Notice of Objection does not dispute the determination as
         indicated in a written notice to the party submitting the Notice of
         Objection within such twenty-day period, then Closing Date Working
         Capital shall be deemed to be the amount set forth as the Closing Date
         Working Capital in the Notice of Objection and the Net Purchase Price
         shall be adjusted by the amount, if any, by which such Closing Date
         Working Capital exceeds or is less than the Estimated Net Working
         Capital (the "Change in Working Capital"). If the party receiving a
         Notice of Objection delivers a timely notice of dispute, the parties
         shall both use good faith efforts to mutually agree upon a
         determination of Closing Date Working Capital in order to reach an
         amount, if any, of the Change in Working Capital. If Buyer and Seller
         fail to mutually agree on the Change in Working Capital within thirty
         (30) days after receipt of the Notice of Objection, Buyer and Seller
         shall retain Plante & Moran PLLC, or, if such firm is unable or
         unwilling to serve in this capacity, then another independent
         accountant acceptable to both Buyer and Seller (the "Independent
         Accountant") to cause a determination to be made of the Change in
         Working Capital in accordance with SECTION 3.4(b).

                  (ii)     If neither party delivers a Notice of Objection on or
         before the Objection Date, the Estimated Net Working Capital shall be
         conclusively established as the final and correct Closing Date Working
         Capital and the Estimated Cash Purchase Price shall be deemed the Net
         Purchase Price. If either party delivers, or both parties

                                     - 12 -

<PAGE>

         deliver, a Notice of Objection on or before the Objection Date,
         following the resolution of the Notice of Objection pursuant to this
         SECTION 3.4 and the payment of any amounts required under SECTION
         3.4(d) hereof, the purchase price as so determined shall be the Net
         Purchase Price.

         (b)      Independent Accountant Determination. The Independent
Accountant shall determine, on the basis of, and consistent with, the basis and
procedures set forth in SCHEDULE 3.2 and the definition of Net Working Capital,
the Change in Working Capital and shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, in
accordance with SECTION 11.4 hereof and as soon as practicable upon completion
but in any event not later than 30 days after being engaged to reach the Change
in Working Capital, (i) its determination of the Closing Date Working Capital,
(ii) its determination of the Change in Working Capital and (iii) its
calculation of the amount of the payment, if any, to be made pursuant to SECTION
3.4(d) hereof (the "Independent Accountant Determination"). Buyer and Seller
hereby agree to cooperate with, and to cause its personnel and agents to
cooperate with and be reasonably available to discuss, the Independent
Accountant Determination.

         (c)      Independent Accountant Binding. The Independent Accountant
Determination shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller without any
further right of appeal. All costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant
shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller.

         (d)      Payment. The amount of any Change in Working Capital mutually
agreed to by Buyer and Seller or as reflected in the Independent Accountant
Determination, as the case may be:

                  (i)      If Positive Change. If the Change in Working Capital
         is determined to be positive, then the amount of such change shall be
         paid by Buyer to Seller within five Business Days after the receipt by
         Buyer and Seller of the Independent Accountant Determination or the
         agreement between Buyer and Seller, as the case may be; and

                  (ii)     If Negative Change. If the Change in Working Capital
         is determined to be negative, then Buyer shall be entitled to recover
         the amount of such change from the Holdback Amount as provided in the
         Escrow Agreement.

         (e)      Creation and Storage of Back-Up Materials. Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to create and store a
back-up record of the Seller's MIS system on the last day before the Closing
Date, the Closing Date and the day immediately after the Closing Date, which
such back-up record shall be used by Buyer and Seller, and any third party
necessary (including the Independent Accountant), to determine the Change in
Working Capital. The back-up record shall be stored and held in escrow by Iron
Mountain through the date of the final disbursement pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement and all costs and expenses related to this SECTION 3.4(e) shall be
paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

         SECTION 3.5 ALLOCATION OF NET PURCHASE PRICE. The parties agree that,
for all tax and other reporting purposes, the Net Purchase Price shall be
allocated among the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities in accordance
with the principles set forth in SCHEDULE 3.5 attached

                                     - 13 -

cause to be filed, a Form 8594 and all applicable federal, state, local,
provincial and foreign income, franchise and excise tax returns in a manner that

authority, the party receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify the
other party hereto concerning the existence of such dispute and the parties
shall consult with each other with respect to all issues related to the
allocation in connection with such dispute. If the Internal Revenue Service
proposes a different allocation, either party may file amended returns based on
such allocation.

         SECTION 3.6 TAXES, TITLE COMMITMENT AND INSURANCE. Buyer shall be
charged with and solely responsible for (a) any and all excise, sales, use,
transfer, value added, registration, stamp, recording, documentary, conveyance,

by this Agreement, including, without limitation, in the case of a direct

Agreement and payable by Buyer pursuant to this Section; (b) any and all costs
of examining or transferring title to the Owned Real Property, (c) any and all
costs of obtaining a title commitment or title insurance; and (d) any and all

                                    ARTICLE V
                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Seller hereby makes the following representations and warranties to Buyer:

         SECTION 5.1 ORGANIZATION; QUALIFICATION. Seller is a limited liability
company duly formed, validly existing and in full force and effect under the
laws of the State of Ohio and Seller has the requisite limited liability power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority could not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.2 AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT. Seller has full
limited liability company power and authority to enter into this Agreement and
each Ancillary Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement by Seller and the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite
limited liability company action. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Seller and (assuming this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of Buyer) constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditor's rights generally. At the Closing, each
Ancillary Agreement executed and delivered by Seller will have been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Seller and (assuming each such Ancillary
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Buyer) each such
Ancillary Agreement will constitute a valid and binding agreement of Seller,
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditor's rights generally.

         SECTION 5.3 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE
5.3, no consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration, filing or
registration with, any Governmental Entity will be required to be made or
obtained by Seller in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
except those already obtained and for consents, approvals, authorizations,
declarations, filings or registrations that if not obtained are not reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 5.3,
no consent, approval, waiver or authorization of any Person will be required in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except those already
obtained and for consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations that if not
obtained are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
parties acknowledge that Seller will not obtain the consents indicated in
SCHEDULE 5.3, other than those listed in subsection H thereof. It is not a
breach of this SECTION 5.3, and Seller shall have no liability arising from the
failure to obtain such third party consents, other than any failure relating to
the Contracts specified in subsection H of SCHEDULE 5.3.

                                     - 17 -

<PAGE>

         SECTION 5.4 NO VIOLATIONS. Assuming that the consents, approvals,
authorizations, declarations and filings referred in SCHEDULE 5.3, subsection H,
are obtained and in full force and effect and assuming that the consents,
approvals, authorizations, declarations and filings referred to as not being
required to be obtained in SCHEDULE 5.3 had been obtained or made, and the
conditions set forth in Article VIII shall have been satisfied, at the Closing
neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements by Seller, nor the consummation by Seller of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, nor compliance by Seller with any
of the provisions hereof or thereof will (a) conflict with or result in any
breach of any provisions of the Articles of Organization or Operating Agreement
of Seller, (b) result in a violation or breach of any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any Contract or any material note, bond, mortgage, deed of
trust, security interest, indenture, license, contract, agreement, plan or other
instrument or obligation to which Seller is a party or by which the Purchased
Assets may be bound or related to the Business, or (c) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Seller, the
Purchased Assets or the Business, except in the case of clauses (b) or (c) for
violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations,
creations, impositions, suspensions or revocations of which Seller does not have
Knowledge and that would not individually or collectively have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.5 NO DEFAULT; COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS; PERMITS.

         (a)      Seller is not in default or violation of any term, condition
or provision of (i) its Articles of Organization, Operating Agreement or other
organizational documents or (ii) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment,
decree, order, arbitration award, concession, grant, franchise, Permit or
license or approval applicable to the Business or by which the Purchased Assets
are bound, but excluding from the foregoing clause (ii) defaults or violations
of which Seller does not have Knowledge and that would not individually or
collectively have a Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
SECTION 5.5(a) shall not apply to Environmental Laws, which are exclusively the
subject of the representations and warranties in SECTION 5.10.

         (b)      Except as could not be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect, the Permits constitute all permits, licenses, authorizations,
certificates, exemptions and approvals of Governmental Entities necessary or
proper for the current use, occupancy and operation of the Purchased Assets held
by Seller and the operation of the Business, and all such Permits are in full
force and effect. During the Seller Ownership Period, Seller has not received
any written notice from any Governmental Entity and no proceeding is pending or,
to Seller's Knowledge, threatened revoking, modifying or refusing to renew any
Permit or providing notice of violations under any Permit.

         SECTION 5.6 BOOKS AND RECORDS. The books, records and accounts of
Seller maintained during the Seller Ownership Period with respect to the
Business accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and the assets and
liabilities of Seller with respect to the Business. During the Seller Ownership
Period, Seller has not engaged in any transactions with respect to the Business,
maintained any bank account for the Business or used any of the funds of Seller
in the conduct of the Business except for transactions, bank accounts and funds
that have been and are reflected in the normally maintained books and records of
Seller. To Seller's Knowledge, the

                                     - 18 -

<PAGE>

books, records and accounts relating to the Business prior to July 2, 2003
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions, assets and liabilities of the
Business prior to July 2, 2003.

         SECTION 5.7 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. SCHEDULE 5.7 and the other schedules
hereto set forth all actions of Seller taken during the Seller Ownership Period,
that, if taken after the date hereof, would violate SECTION 7.7 hereof.

         SECTION 5.8 NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except (a) for liabilities and
obligations incurred in the ordinary course during the Seller Ownership Period
and (b) for liabilities and obligations assumed pursuant to the Level Propane
Purchase Agreement and the Sale Order, Seller has not incurred any material
liabilities or obligations of any nature during the Seller Ownership Period that
would be required to be reflected or provided for in a balance sheet of the
Business prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or
would constitute a contingent liability or financing transaction not incurred in
the ordinary course of business that generally accepted accounting principles
would require to be disclosed in financial statements of Seller.

         SECTION 5.9 LITIGATION.

         (a)      Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 5.20 and to the Knowledge of
Seller, during the Seller Ownership Period, there have been no claims, charges,
charges, suits, arbitrations, mediations, inquiries, proceedings or
investigations by any Person or before any Government Entity (collectively
"Actions") pending or threatened against, relating to or affecting the Business,
the Purchased Assets or the membership interest of Seller.

                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

Buyer hereby makes the following representations and warranties to Seller:

         SECTION 6.1 ORGANIZATION. Buyer is a limited partnership duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and Buyer has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except

limited partnership power and authority to enter into this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement by Buyer and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite
limited partnership action. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by Buyer and (assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Seller) constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws

Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Seller) each such
Ancillary Agreement will constitute a valid and binding agreement of Buyer,
enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditor's rights generally.

         SECTION 6.3 BROKERS. No Person is entitled to any brokerage, financial

         SECTION 7.1 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS.

         (a)      Intentionally omitted.

         (b)      Intentionally omitted.

records relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets in the possession of
any other party, to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by
such party in connection with the Assumed Liabilities or other matters

                                     - 25 -

<PAGE>

relating to or affected by the operation of the Business and the Purchased
Assets. Such access shall be afforded by the party in possession of such books
and records upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business
hours; provided, however, that: (i) any such access shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of

that would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or would
threaten disclosure of Buyer's proprietary or confidential business information
and (iii) no party need supply the other party with any information that such
party is under a legal obligation not to supply and commercially reasonable
efforts have been used to remove or waive the legal restriction. The party
exercising this right of access shall be solely responsible for any costs or
expenses incurred by it pursuant to this SECTION 7.1(a). If the party in
possession of such books and records shall desire to dispose of any such books
and records upon or prior to the expiration of such period, such party shall,
prior to such disposition, give the other party, at such other party's expense,
a reasonable prior notice and opportunity to segregate and remove such books and
records as such other party may select.

         (d)      Seller agrees to take commercially reasonable steps as
requested by Buyer from time-to-time to obtain Plante & Moran, PLLC's consent
and cooperation to permit and enable Buyer to include the Fiscal 2003 Financial

all customer names, addresses, locations and other identifying information, any
confidential or proprietary methods, record, data, trade secret, pricing policy,
bid amount, bid strategy, rate, structure, personnel policy, method or practice
of soliciting or obtaining or doing business, or any other confidential or
proprietary information whatsoever relating to the Business and the Purchased
Assets. Seller agrees that, except as otherwise agreed between Buyer and Seller,

employees, members, managers, attorneys, accountants, consultants (including
financial consultants), advisors or agents or those of any of its affiliates in
connection with negotiating and/or executing this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and consummating the sale of the Purchased Assets, (ii) to the extent

necessary to avoid committing a violation of law or any rule or regulation and

         SECTION 7.3 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be

and regulations to consummate and make effective the sale of the Purchased
Assets in accordance with this Agreement, including, without limitation, using
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure timely satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to each party's obligations hereunder. Neither Seller, on the one
hand, nor Buyer, on the other hand, shall, without the prior written consent of
the other party, take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impede, interfere with or delay the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. From time to time on or after the Closing Date, Seller shall, at its
own expense, execute and deliver such documents to Buyer as Buyer may reasonably
request in order to more effectively vest in Buyer Seller's title to the
Purchased Assets. From time to time after the date hereof, Buyer shall, at its
own expense, execute and deliver such documents to Seller as Seller may
reasonably request in order to more effectively consummate the sale of the
Purchased Assets and the assumption and assignment of the Assumed Liabilities in
accordance with this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.4 COOPERATION ON TAX MATTERS. Buyer and Seller agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Business and the
Purchased Assets (including access to books and records) as is reasonably
necessary for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns in connection with
matters relating to (or affected by) the operations of Seller prior to the
Closing, including, without limitation, the preparation for any audit by any
Taxing Authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer and

least 30 days prior written notice before destroying any such books and records,
during which period the party receiving such notice can elect to take
possession, at its own expense, of such books and records. The requesting party
shall bear all costs and expenses of the other party furnishing or causing to be
furnished such information or assistance.

         SECTION 7.5 EMPLOYEES.

         (a)      Buyer agrees to make offers of employment on or before the
Closing Date, effective as of the Closing Date, to a sufficient number of Seller
Employees such that the termination of employment of the remaining employees by

any similar applicable state laws; such offers by Buyer shall include terms and
conditions with respect to each individual Seller Employee made an offer that
are, taken as a whole, no less favorable to such Seller Employee than the terms
and conditions as exist between Seller and such Seller Employee as of the date
hereof. All of the employees who have accepted Buyer's offers of employment made
pursuant to this SECTION 7.5 (the "Hired Employees") shall become employees of
Buyer as of 12:01 A.M. (local time) on the Closing Date (with the intent that no

the Hired Employees with a W-2 form as soon as practicable after the Closing.
Buyer shall be solely

Closing Date and for all costs and expenses of all workers' compensation claims
made by Hired Employees after the Closing Date for occurrences after the Closing
Date. Seller shall be solely responsible for any and all severance pay and
benefits that become due to Seller Employees who are not Hired Employees or who
do not receive offers of employment from Buyer as provided above. Buyer shall
not be responsible for any severance pay and benefits with respect to any Seller
Employees who do not become Hired Employees, other than as a result of the WARN
Act.

         (b)      Seller shall at its own expense fully vest each Hired Employee
under Seller's 401(k) retirement plan, terminate any related annuity contract
and such plan, and take such other actions as are necessary to enable the Hired
Employees to roll-over their investments into Buyer 401(k) retirement plan.

         (c)      Upon Closing, Buyer shall provide health care continuation
coverage under Buyer's plans in a manner that satisfies duties owed to Hired
Employees, terminated employees, COBRA beneficiaries and M and A qualified

         SECTION 7.8 INSURANCE. Until the Closing, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect all of the existing

pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation system. Seller shall promptly provide Buyer with copies of
each announcement disseminated to Seller's employees generally regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
whether such announcements are made prior to, contemporaneously with or after
the Closing Date.

         SECTION 7.10 REGULATORY FILINGS. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in
writing, each of the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
(a) obtain, and to cooperate with the other party in obtaining, all reviews,
authorizations, consents, orders or approvals of Governmental Entities that may
be or become necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to or after the Closing and (b) defend (in
a commercially reasonable manner) against any effort to enjoin consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including prompt appeal of any adverse
decision or order by any Governmental Entity.

         SECTION 7.11 REJECTION AND ASSUMPTION OF CONTRACTS. Seller agrees that
from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date it shall not: (i) amend
or seek to amend the Sale Order to reduce the period for acceptance or rejection
of Contracts; (ii) reject Contracts in accordance with the Sale Order without
the prior written consent of Buyer; or (iii) finally assume any Contracts to be
assumed by Buyer under this Agreement in accordance with the Sale Order without
the prior written consent of Buyer, it being understood that Buyer is relying on
its ability to finally assume or reject Contracts as assignee of Seller under
the Sale Order through October 31, 2003.

         SECTION 7.12 UTILITIES. To the extent not included as a liability in
the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital, Seller shall reimburse Buyer
for all utility costs incurred by the Business prior to, and allocable to the
period prior to, the Closing Date, which costs are paid by Buyer after the

Seller within 10 days after receipt by Seller of a calculation prepared by Buyer
detailing the amount owed by Seller hereunder and a copy of the invoice
detailing the total utility costs for the period of such invoice. The
calculation of the amount Seller shall be required to pay shall be based on the
total cost reflected in the utility invoices multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of days of such utility invoice period
that occurred prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be
the total number of days of such utility invoice period.

         SECTION 7.13 ACCESS TO REAL PROPERTY. Seller hereby grants Buyer a
no-fee license, commencing on the Closing Date, to leave the Purchased Assets at
the Herkimer (Ridgefield

<PAGE>

Springs), New York facility and the Cadillac, Michigan facility not being
acquired by Buyer hereunder, for a period of 90 days after the Closing Date and
hereby grants Buyer access to the real property for such 90-day period so that
Buyer may remove the Purchased Assets. Buyer's access to such real property
shall be at Buyer's own risk, and Buyer covenants with Seller that it shall use
reasonable care when exercising its right to access under this SECTION 7.13,
shall not cause any dangerous condition on the real property to exist after the
expiration of such 90-day period that did not exist prior to the Closing Date
and shall be responsible for any acts or omissions that it takes or fails to
take on such real property. The obligations set forth in this SECTION 7.13 shall
survive the Closing.

         SECTION 7.14 SERVICE OF CUSTOMERS. Buyer covenants with Seller (with no
intention to create any third-party beneficiary rights) to service all Active
Customers, in accordance with Buyer's customary terms and conditions, to the
extent that, and only for so long as, Buyer deems it commercially reasonable to
do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section is intended to
limit Buyer's rights to assume or not assume contracts in its sole discretion
under the Level Propane Purchase Agreement and the Sale Order or to expand the
scope of Assumed Liabilities specified in SECTION 2.3.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

         (b)      Seller shall have made all required deliveries pursuant to

         (b)      Buyer shall have made all required deliveries pursuant to

                           TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

         SECTION 9.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing by:

         (a)      mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

         (b)      Buyer, if there has been a material violation or material
breach by Seller of any covenant, representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement, and such violation or breach, if susceptible to
cure, has not been cured by Seller within five Business Days of receipt of
written notice thereof or waived by Buyer;

         (c)      Seller, if there has been a material violation or material

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         SECTION 10.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS.

         (a)      The representations and warranties of Buyer and Seller in this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and in any other agreements, documents or
certificates executed or delivered by Buyer or Seller pursuant to this Agreement
or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
survive the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and such other
documents and the Closing and remain in full force and effect until the December
31, 2004 (which in no way limits Buyer's right to recover with respect to any
breach of representation or warranty discovered prior to the expiration date),
with the exception of the warranties set forth in SECTION 5.10, which shall
survive indefinitely. All representations and warranties of Buyer, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, set forth in this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and in the other documents contemplated hereby shall be deemed to
have been made again by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, at and as of the
Closing (except for representations and warranties made as of a specified date,
which shall be deemed to have been made only as of the specified date). This
SECTION 10.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto
that by its terms contemplates performance after any Closing or after the
termination of this Agreement.

         (b)      Unless a specified period is set forth in this Agreement (in
which event such specified period will control), all covenants and agreements of
Buyer and Seller in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and in any other
agreements, documents or certificates executed or delivered by Buyer or Seller
pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall survive the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and such other documents and the Closing and remain in full force and
effect until performed in full. Except as expressly set forth in this Article X,
the covenants and agreements contained in this Article X shall in all events
survive the Closing without time limit.

         SECTION 10.2 LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a)      Buyer shall not be entitled to make a claim against Seller for
indemnification under SECTION 10.3(a)(other than under subsection (iv) thereof)
unless and until the aggregate amount of claims that may be asserted for
Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to SECTION 10.3(a) (other than under subsection
(iv) thereof) exceeds $50,000, in which event the indemnity provided for in
SECTION 10.3(a) shall be effective with respect to all of the Indemnifiable
Buyer Losses without regard to such threshold. Except as set forth below,
individual claims by LP Gas customers of the Business under $500 shall not
constitute Indemnifiable Buyer Losses or be considered for purposes of
determining whether the $50,000 threshold has been exceeded. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a group of individual claims by LP Gas customers arise from a
common underlying event or circumstance, which therefore comprises a pattern of
substantially similar claims, then the aggregate claims of those LP Gas
customers shall be Indemnifiable Buyer Losses and shall count toward the $50,000
threshold referred to above. By way of illustration, if fifty different LP Gas
customers make successful claims, each being less than $500 but each based on a
common underlying event or circumstance that is shared by such LP

                                     - 33 -

<PAGE>

Gas customers (such as a particular attorney general determination), then the
claims do count toward the threshold and Buyer shall be entitled to bring a
claim for Indemnifiable Buyer Losses once the $50,000 is satisfied.

         (b)      Seller shall not be entitled to make a claim against Buyer for
indemnification under SECTION 10.3(b) unless and until the aggregate amount of
claims that may be asserted for Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to SECTION 10.3(b)
exceeds $50,000, in which event the indemnity provided for in SECTION 10.3(b)
shall be effective with respect to all of the Indemnifiable Buyer Losses without
regard to such threshold.

         (c)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of Seller for Indemnifiable Buyer
Losses under SECTION 10.3(a) shall be an amount equal to the $15.5 million,
except that Seller's liability for Indemnifiable Buyer Losses resulting from the
fraud or the willful misconduct of Seller shall be unlimited and the $15.5
million cap shall not apply to such cases involving fraud or willful misconduct
or a breach of SECTION 5.2.

         (d)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of Buyer for Indemnifiable Seller
Losses under SECTION 10.3(b) shall be an amount equal to $15.5 million, except
that Buyer's liability for Indemnifiable Seller Losses resulting from the fraud
or the willful misconduct of Buyer shall be unlimited and the $15.5 million cap
shall not apply to such cases involving fraud or willful misconduct or a breach
of SECTION 6.2.

         (e)      From and after the Closing, as between Seller and the Seller
Indemnitees, on the one hand, and Buyer and Buyer Indemnitees, on the other
hand, the remedies set forth in this Article X shall be the exclusive remedies
with respect to this Agreement, other than in the case of fraud or willful
misconduct, and other than equitable relief.

         (f)      No Indemnity Payment shall be required to be paid for any
Indemnifiable Loss under SECTION 10.3 unless notice of such claim is given
pursuant to SECTION 10.4 prior to December 31, 2004, except for violations of
the representations and warranties contained in SECTION 5.10, which shall
survive indefinitely.

         (g)      Prior to seeking indemnification under SECTION 10.3, an
Indemnitee shall deliver appropriate claims to any relevant insurer or third
party obligated to indemnify such Indemnitee with respect to the Loss giving
rise to such claim. An Indemnitee shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assert
any such claims and shall cooperate, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, with
the Indemnifying Party's prosecution of such claims. The amount of any Losses
for which indemnification is provided under SECTION 10.3 shall be net of any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee under insurance policies of either
Seller or Buyer or from other Persons with respect to such Loss.

         (h)      No Indemnifiable Buyer Loss shall accrue and no Indemnity
Payment under SECTION 10.3(a) shall be required for any Losses arising from
Buyer's exercise of its rights as assignee of Seller under SECTIONS 2.5 and 7.13
of the Level Propane Purchase Agreement.

                                     - 34 -

<PAGE>

         (i)      If and to the extent that prior to the Closing Seller has
Knowledge or Buyer has actual knowledge of the breach of or inaccuracy in a
representation, warranty or covenant made by the other party, then such party
shall not have the right to assert a claim for indemnification in respect of
such breach or inaccuracy, and the party against whom such claim could otherwise
be asserted shall have no liability or obligation in respect thereof.

         SECTION 10.3 INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a)      Seller Indemnification. Subject to SECTIONS 10.1 and 10.2
hereof, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold

Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims, demands or suits (by any
Person, including any Governmental Entity), losses, liabilities, damages, fines,
penalties, obligations, payments, costs and expenses, paid or incurred, whether
or not relating to, resulting from or arising out of any Third Party Claim,
including the costs and expenses of any and all actions, suits, proceedings,
demands, assessments, judgments, settlements, and compromises relating thereto
and reasonable attorneys' fees in connection therewith (collectively, "Losses")
(provided, that Losses shall not include any punitive damages of any Buyer
Indemnitee) (individually and collectively, "Indemnifiable Buyer Losses")
resulting from or arising out of any of the following:

                  (i)      any breach by Seller of any of the representations or
         warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement;

                  (ii)     any breach by Seller of any covenant or agreement of
         Seller contained in this Agreement;

                  (iii)    any Excluded Liability;

                  (iv)     any payments or liabilities incurred by Buyer with
         respect to the current liabilities included, or that should have been
         included, in the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital (as
         finally determined and adjusted for under SECTION 3.4(d)), in the
         aggregate, in excess of the aggregate amounts included for current
         liabilities in such Closing Date Working Capital, with such excess, if
         any, determined as of a cut-off date of December 15, 2004;

                  (v)      any liabilities other than Assumed Liabilities that
         are imposed upon Buyer as a consequence of failure by the parties to
         comply with any applicable bulk sales or similar laws relating to the
         sales contemplated by this Agreement.

         (b)      Buyer Indemnification. Subject to SECTIONS 10.1 and 10.2
hereof, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
employees and representatives (collectively, "Seller Indemnitees") from and
against any and all Losses (provided, that Losses shall not include any punitive
damages of any Seller Indemnitee) (individually and collectively, "Indemnifiable
Seller Losses"; and, collectively with Indemnifiable Buyer Losses,
"Indemnifiable Losses") resulting from or arising out of any of the following:

                                     - 35 -

<PAGE>

                  (i)      any breach by Buyer of any of the representations or
         warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement;

                  (ii)     any breach by Buyer of any covenant or agreement of
         Buyer contained in this Agreement;

                  (iii)    any Assumed Liability; and

                  (iv)     without limiting subsection (iii) above, the conduct
         of the Business by Buyer or any part thereof, or use or lease by Buyer
         of any Purchased Asset, in each case, after the Closing.

         (c)      For purposes of this Agreement (i) "Indemnity Payment" means
any amount of Indemnifiable Losses required to be paid pursuant to this SECTION
10.3, (ii) "Indemnitee" means any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement and (iii) "Indemnifying Party" means any Person required to provide
indemnification under this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.4 DEFENSE OF CLAIMS.

         (a)      If any Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any
claim or cause of action or of the commencement of any action, proceeding or
investigation by any Person (including any Governmental Entity) who is not a
party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of such a party (a "Third Party Claim")
against such Indemnitee, with respect to which an Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall
give such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof; provided,
however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation
hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party thereby
is prejudiced. Such notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail, and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's
own counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee), and the Indemnitee
shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; provided, however, that if the
Indemnitee reasonably determines that there exists a conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party (or any constituent part of it) and the
Indemnitee, the Indemnitee (or any constituent part of it) shall have the right
to engage separate counsel, the reasonable costs and expenses of which shall be
paid by the Indemnifying Party, but in no event shall the Indemnified Party be
liable for the costs and expenses of more than one separate counsel. In the
event the Indemnifying Party shall not have assumed the defense and the
Indemnitee is conducting the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to monitor the defense by the Indemnitee, to consult with the Indemnitee with
respect to such claim and to be kept fully informed by the Indemnitee of such
Third Party Claim, which shall include, without limitation, the right to review
and obtain copies of all pleadings, motions and correspondence, and other non
privileged documentation and information in connection with such Third Party
Claim, in each case as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee shall make available to each other as
reasonably requested their attorneys and accountants and all books and records
relating to Third Party Claims and the parties hereto agree to render to each

                                     - 36 -

other such assistance as they may reasonably require to ensure the proper and
adequate defense of any Third Party Claim. The right to assume the defense of
any Third Party Claim shall include, without limitation, the right to assert,
for the benefit of the Indemnitee, cross-claims and counterclaims in connection
with such Third Party Claim that are directly related to such Third Party Claim.

         (b)      If, within 20 calendar days after giving notice of a Third
Party Claim to an Indemnifying Party pursuant to SECTION 10.4(a), an Indemnitee
receives written notice from the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnifying Party
has elected to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim as provided in
SECTION 10.4(a), the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof; provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party fails to take
reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within 20
calendar days after receiving written notice from the Indemnitee that the
Indemnitee believes the Indemnifying Party has failed to take such steps, the
Indemnitee may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for all costs or expenses paid or incurred in connection therewith.

         (c)      Without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, the Indemnifying Party shall not
enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the release by the claimant or the plaintiff of the
Indemnitee and its Affiliates from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim or that could reasonably be expected to lead to liability or create any
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnitee or any Affiliate
thereof for which the Indemnitee or any Affiliate thereof is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder or that would require the Indemnitee or any Affiliate
thereof to change in any material respect the way it conducts business. If a
firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim that could not be expected to
lead to liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part
of the Indemnitee or any Affiliate thereof for which the Indemnitee or any
Affiliate thereof is not entitled to indemnification hereunder or to require the
Indemnitee or any Affiliate thereof to change in any material respect the way it
does business and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such
offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to Indemnitee to that
effect. If the Indemnitee fails to consent to such firm offer within 20 calendar
days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnitee may, at its sole cost and
expense, continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such
event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party
Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer.

         (d)      Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss
that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by such Indemnitee by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt
written notice thereof; provided, however that no delay on the part of the
Indemnitee in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced.

         (e)      In the event that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability under the indemnity provisions of this SECTION 10.4, it shall, within
20 days after receiving written notice of a Third Party Claim or a Direct Claim,
give written notice of such dispute to the Indemnitee. The parties shall then
use all commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute in a mutually
agreeable

                                     - 37 -

<PAGE>

manner. If such efforts fail, either the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnitee
may bring an action to resolve such dispute. Pending resolution of any such
dispute, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, compromise or
settle such claim at the risk of the Indemnifying Party.

         (f)      If the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss, at any time
subsequent to the making of an Indemnity Payment, is reduced by recovery,
settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant
to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person,
the amount of such reduction, less any costs, expenses, premiums or other
offsets incurred in connection therewith shall promptly be repaid by the
Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party. For the purposes of applying the
limitation on the aggregate amount of the indemnification obligation of Seller
under SECTION 10.2(b), the aggregate amount of all Indemnity Payments made by
Seller shall be reduced by any recovery, settlement or other payment under or
pursuant to any insurance coverage or any recovery, settlement or other payment
by or against any other Person, in any such case as a result of or in respect of
any such Indemnity Payment, less any costs, expenses, premiums or other offsets
incurred in connection therewith. UPON MAKING ANY INDEMNITY PAYMENT, THE
INDEMNIFYING PARTY SHALL, TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH INDEMNITY PAYMENT, BE SUBROGATED
TO ALL RIGHTS OF THE INDEMNITEE AGAINST ANY THIRD PARTY THAT IS NOT AN AFFILIATE
OF THE INDEMNITEE IN RESPECT OF THE INDEMNIFIABLE LOSS TO WHICH THE INDEMNITY
PAYMENT RELATES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OR EFFECT OF ANY OTHER
PROVISION HEREOF, EACH SUCH INDEMNITEE SHALL DULY EXECUTE UPON REQUEST ALL
INSTRUMENTS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO EVIDENCE AND PERFECT THE ABOVE DESCRIBED
SUBROGATION RIGHTS.

the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting
such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with
such obligation, covenant, or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

         SECTION 11.3 SURVIVAL. The representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the only representations
and warranties made by Seller and Buyer with respect to the transactions
