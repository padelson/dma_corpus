ARTICLE I

 

THE TRANSACTION

 

Section 1.1 _The Transaction_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Companies Law, and the terms of the
Scheme of Arrangement: (i) all the Company Ordinary Shares then outstanding

with the Court); and (ii) Buyer shall issue New Buyer Shares and cause New
Buyer Shares to be delivered to the Company Shareholders. The Company Ordinary
Shares will be acquired with full title guarantee, free from all Liens (other

with all rights at the Effective Time or thereafter attached thereto,
including the right to receive and retain all dividends and other
distributions (if any).

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Transaction (the "Closing") shall

Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 on a date to be agreed upon by Buyer and
Company that is no later than the fifth business day following the date on
which the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) occurs, or at such
other place, date and time as Company and Buyer may agree in writing. The date
on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date." The
Closing shall be deemed to have occurred as of 12:01 a.m. New York time on the
Closing Date.    

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Scheme of Arrangement
shall become effective at such time as an act of the Royal Court of Jersey
(the "Court") sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement (such order, the "Court
Order") has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Jersey (such date
and time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

 

ARTICLE II

 

TRANSFER OF COMPANY ORDINARY SHARES; ISSUANCE OF NEW BUYER SHARES

 

Section 2.1 _Transfer of Company Ordinary Shares_. At the Effective Time, all
Company Ordinary Shares then outstanding shall be transferred from the Company
Shareholders in accordance with the provisions of the Scheme of Arrangement,
_Section 1.1_ , this _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.2_ , and the Company
Shareholders shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Company
Ordinary Shares, except their rights under the Scheme of Arrangement,
including the right to receive the Consideration. At the Effective Time, or as
promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, Company's Register of Members
will be updated in accordance with the provisions of the Scheme of Arrangement
to reflect the transfer of the Company Ordinary Shares under the Scheme of
Arrangement.

 

Section 2.2 _Consideration; Issuance of New Buyer Shares_.

 

(a) _Consideration_. Subject to and in consideration for the transfer of the
Company Ordinary Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , on the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, under the Scheme of Arrangement and subject to the terms and conditions
thereof and subject to _Section 2.2(b)_ , _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.7_ ,
for each Company Ordinary Share subject to the Scheme of Arrangement, issue
0.4534 (as may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ , the "Exchange
Ratio") of New Buyer Shares (the "Share Consideration", and together with the
Fractional Share Consideration, the "Consideration") duly authorized, validly
issued, and credited as fully paid, non-assessable and free from all Liens, in
each case, to the relevant Company Shareholders.

 

(b) _Share Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Company Ordinary Shares or shares of Buyer
Common Stock shall have been changed into, or exchanged for, a different
number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
share split, reverse share split, combination or exchange of shares, or a
stock dividend shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any
similar event shall have occurred, then the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.2(b)_ shall be construed to permit
Company or Buyer to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by _Section 5.1_ or the other terms of this Agreement.

   

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall (A) select a nationally recognized bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as exchange agent for
the payment of the Consideration ("Exchange Agent") and (B) enter into an
exchange agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Company, with such Exchange Agent. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of Company
Shareholders, (1) certificates or, at Buyer's option, evidence of shares in
book-entry form, representing the aggregate Share Consideration and (2) cash
in an amount equal to the aggregate Fractional Share Consideration. All shares
and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund".

 

(ii) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in
any event within three business days after the Effective Time, Buyer shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Ordinary Shares (the "Certificates") or non-certificated
Company Ordinary Shares represented by book-entry (the "Book-Entry Shares")
that is entitled to receive the Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ (i)
a letter of transmittal, which shall specify, in the case of certificated
Company Ordinary Shares, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Buyer and Exchange Agent may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Company or Buyer, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ for
each Company Ordinary Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, to be delivered within ten business days following the later to
occur of (x) the Effective Time or (y) the Exchange Agent's receipt of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and
the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. If payment of the Consideration is to be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent to payment that (A) the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and (B) the person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Buyer that such
Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the applicable Consideration as contemplated by this _Article
II_ , without interest thereon. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which has not
been transferred to the holders of Company Ordinary Shares within twelve
months of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Buyer or its designee(s)
promptly upon request by Buyer, it being understood that no such delivery
shall affect any legal right that a Company Shareholder may have to receive
the Consideration. None of Buyer, Company or the Exchange Agent or any of
their respective affiliates or agents shall be liable to any person in respect
of any Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

     

(d) The Parties' obligations in relation to the issuance of the New Buyer
Shares will be as set out more specifically in the Scheme of Arrangement.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Ordinary Shares on the records of Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to the
Company Ordinary Shares formerly represented thereby except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Buyer for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 

(f) In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof (such affidavit to be in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer and the Exchange Agent), the Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ hereof, including any amount payable in respect
of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.7_ ;
_provided, however_ , that Buyer may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such reasonable and customary
amount as Buyer may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Buyer and its Subsidiaries or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

Section 2.3 _Company Long Term Incentive Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Restricted Stock Units._ Except with respect to the Existing RSU
Awards set forth on _Section 2.3(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which
schedule may be updated by Buyer prior to the Closing to list additional
Existing RSU Awards (the "Scheduled RSU Awards"), each Existing RSU Award,
whether vested or unvested, shall, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted on the same terms and conditions (including
applicable vesting conditions) applicable to such Existing RSU Award under the
applicable Company Stock Plan and Award Agreement in effect immediately prior
to the Closing into an award of restricted stock units of Buyer covering a
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock, rounded up or down to the nearest
whole share, determined by multiplying the number of Company Ordinary Shares
subject to such Existing RSU Award immediately prior to Closing by the
Exchange Ratio (such restricted stock unit of Buyer, a "Converted RSU Award");
provided, that, each such Converted RSU Award shall immediately become fully
vested upon any "Qualifying Termination" as defined in the Award Agreements of
the holder thereof. Each Scheduled RSU Award, whether vested or unvested,
shall, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive, for each restricted stock unit subject to
such Scheduled RSU Award, an amount of cash equal to the Cash Value.

     

(b) _Company Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units._ Except with respect to
the Existing PSU Awards set forth on _Section 2.3(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, which schedule may be updated by Buyer prior to the
Closing to list additional Existing PSU Awards (the "Scheduled PSU Awards"),
each Existing PSU Award, whether vested or unvested, shall, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into an award of restricted
stock units of Buyer covering a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock,
rounded up or down to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying (i)
the number of Company Ordinary Shares subject to such Existing PSU Award
immediately prior to the Closing, with performance deemed to have been
achieved (for the sole purpose of determining the number of Company Ordinary
Shares subject to such Existing PSU Award) at the greater of (A) the value of
the performance units subject to such Existing PSU Award based on the level of
attainment of the applicable performance goal as of the Effective Time, as
determined by the compensation committee of the Company Board of Directors in
its reasonable judgment (such value with respect to an Existing PSU Award, the
"Achieved PSU Number")), and (B) the target number of Ordinary Shares subject
to such Existing PSU Award, by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (such restricted stock
unit of Buyer, a "Converted PSU Award"). Each Converted PSU Award shall (i) be
subject to the same time-based vesting conditions that applied to the Existing
PSU Award immediately prior to Closing and shall not be subject to any
performance-based vesting conditions and (ii) in all other respects be subject
to substantially the same terms and conditions applicable to the Existing PSU
Award under the applicable Company Stock Plan and Award Agreement governing
such Existing PSU Award as in effect immediately prior to Closing; _provided_
, that, each such Converted PSU Award shall immediately become fully vested
upon any "Qualifying Termination" of employment as defined in the Award
Agreements of the holder thereof. Each Scheduled PSU Award, whether vested or
unvested, shall, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, automatically
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive, for each restricted stock unit subject to
such Scheduled PSU Award (which, for this purpose, shall be a number equal to
the greater of the Achieved PSU Number and the target number of Ordinary
Shares subject to the Scheduled PSU Award) an amount of cash equal to the Cash
Value.

 

(c) _Company Share Options._ Each Existing Option, whether vested or unvested,
shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof be cancelled and of no further force or effect as
of the Effective Time and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Cash
Value over the exercise price per Company Ordinary Share of such Existing
Option multiplied by (ii) the total number of Company Ordinary Shares subject
to such Existing Option. For the avoidance of doubt, where the exercise price
per Company Ordinary Share of any Existing Option equals or exceeds the Cash
Value, such Existing Option shall be cancelled without any payment therefore.

 

(d) _Company Director Units._ Each Existing DU Award shall, in accordance with
the terms and conditions applicable to such Existing DU Award under the
applicable Company Stock Plan and Award Agreement in effect immediately prior
to Closing, (i) vest as of the Effective Time and (ii) automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive, for each restricted stock unit subject to
such Existing DU Award, an amount of cash equal to the Cash Value.

    

(e) Company and Buyer shall each take, or procure the taking of, all action
necessary, as applicable, to provide for the treatment of the Existing RSU
Awards, Existing PSU Awards, Existing Options and Existing DU Awards
(collectively, the "Company Equity Awards") as set forth in the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 2.3_ , including the adoption by the Company Stock
Plan Committee of resolutions determining that each Converted RSU Award and

such amounts at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable
agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such Existing RSU Award, Existing

Plans, including (i) all of the obligations of Company with respect to the
Company Equity Awards and (ii) with respect to any amount of shares (as

rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other applicable state,

provide reasonable advance notice of any such withholding or deduction and
shall work with the other Party in good faith to reduce or eliminate such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and duly
and timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

     

Section 2.5 _Company and Buyer Actions Prior to and at Closing_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Company shall procure that a meeting of
the Board of Directors of Company (or a duly authorized committee thereof) is
held at which resolutions are passed (conditional upon the delivery of the
Court Order to the Registrar of Companies in Jersey and effective as of the
Effective Time) approving:

 

(i) the transfer to Buyer of the Company Ordinary Shares provided to be
transferred under the Scheme of Arrangement and the registration as a member
of such person(s) in accordance with the Scheme of Arrangement in respect of
such Company Ordinary Shares;

 

(ii) the removal or resignation of the directors of Company; and

 

(iii) the appointment of such persons as Buyer shall determine (acting
reasonably) as the directors of Company.

 

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall procure that a meeting of the
Board of Directors of Buyer (or a duly authorized committee thereof) is held
at which resolutions are passed, conditional upon the delivery of the Court
Order to the Registrar of Companies in Jersey (and effective as of the
Effective Time), approving (i) the issuance, in accordance with and subject to
the terms and conditions of _Section 2.2_ and the Scheme of Arrangement, to
holders of the Company Ordinary Shares of the number of New Buyer Shares
provided for in the Scheme of Arrangement, and (ii) the payment of the
Fractional Share Consideration.

 

(c) On the Closing Date, Company shall:

 

(i) deliver the Court Order to the Registrar of Companies in Jersey with a
copy to Buyer;

 

(ii) deliver to Buyer a certified copy of the resolutions referred to in
_Section 2.5(a)_ ;

 

(iii) deliver to Buyer a letter of resignation (or evidence of removal) from
each director who resigns (or is removed) in accordance with _Section
2.5(a)(ii)_ ; and

 

(iv) deliver to Buyer all Certificates received by Company in respect of the
Company Ordinary Shares (if any) transferred to Buyer in accordance with the
Scheme of Arrangement; _provided_ that to the extent any such Certificates are
received after the Closing Date, delivery to Buyer shall be made as promptly
as reasonably practicable thereafter.

 

(d) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Company a certified copy of
the resolutions referred to in _Section 2.5(b)_.

 

Section 2.6 _Further Assurances._ If at any time before or after the Effective
Time, Buyer or Company reasonably believes that any further instruments,
deeds, documents, conveyances, assignments or assurances (including any
consents, notices or permits) are reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Transaction or to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then Buyer and Company and their
respective officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and do all other things
reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Transaction and to carry
out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

    

Section 2.7 _No Fractional Shares_.

 

(a) No fractional shares of New Buyer Shares shall be issued to holders of
Company Ordinary Shares in connection with the Scheme of Arrangement and no
certificates for any such fractional shares shall be issued.

 

(b) All fractional shares to which a single record holder of Company Ordinary
Shares would be entitled shall be aggregated, and calculations shall be
rounded to three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each
holder of Company Ordinary Shares who would otherwise be entitled to such
fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest and
subject to any required Tax withholding, as provided for in _Section 2.4_ ,
rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of
the fractional share interest in a share of New Buyer Shares to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled but for this _Section 2.7_ and (ii)
an amount equal to the Closing Volume-Weighted Average Price (the "Fractional
Share Consideration"). The Parties acknowledge that payment of the net
proceeds from the sale of the fractional shares of New Buyer Shares was not
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Buyer
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of New
Buyer Shares.

covenant is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), Company
represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement. Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted,
except where the failure to have such power and authority would not reasonably

Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) under the
Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite
capacity, power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and

Company Material Adverse Effect.

    

(b) Company has made available to Buyer, prior to the date hereof, true and
complete copies of Company's articles of association (the "Company Articles of
Association"). Company is not in violation, in any material respect, of the
Company Articles of Association. None of Company's "significant subsidiaries"

or its Subsidiaries. With respect to each grant of Company Equity Awards, each
such grant was made in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company

(g) The Company Material Subsidiaries identified in _Section 3.1(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule include each "significant subsidiary," as such
term is defined in Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC, of Company as of the
date hereof.

 

Section 3.2 _Company Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation_.

 

(a) Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each other document to be entered into by Company
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (together with this
Agreement, the "Company Transaction Documents") and, subject to _Section
3.2(b)_ , upon receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval and the Court
Order, will have the requisite corporate power and authority to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Transaction. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Company
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of
Directors of Company and, except for the Company Shareholder Approval and the
filing of the required documents and other actions in connection with the
Scheme of Arrangement with, and subject to receipt of the required sanctioning
of the Scheme of Arrangement by, the Court, no other corporate action on the
part of Company or vote of the Company Shareholders is necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery by Company of this Agreement and the other Company
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the Transaction. The Board of
Directors of Company has duly and validly adopted resolutions (i) approving
and declaring advisable this Agreement, including the Transaction, the Scheme
of Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) declaring
that it is in the best interests of the Company Shareholders that Company
enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transaction, the Scheme of
Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated hereby on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, and (iii) directing that an
application be made to the Court pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement. The
Board of Directors of Company has further resolved that it will, subject to
_Section 5.3_ , recommend that the Company Shareholders vote in favor of all
the resolutions comprising the Company Shareholder Approval at duly held
meetings of such shareholders for such purposes (such recommendation referred
to herein as the "Company Board Recommendation"). None of the aforementioned
resolutions, as of the date hereof, have been rescinded, modified or withdrawn
in any way. Each of the Company Transaction Documents has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Company and, assuming each such Company
Transaction Document has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each
other counterparty thereto, each of the Company Transaction Documents
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Company, enforceable
against Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may
be subject to (A) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, administration, arrangement, moratorium or other Laws affecting
or relating to creditors' rights generally or (B) the rules governing the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies and general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law (the "Enforceability Exceptions").

    

(b) Other than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the Companies Law,
(ii) the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules and regulations

1933, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities
Act"), (iv) the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"),
(v) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "HSR Act"), and the antitrust,
competition, foreign investment or similar Laws outside of the United States
set forth in _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (vi) the
approvals set forth in _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the "Company Approvals"), and, subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Buyer in _Section 4.2(b)_ , no
authorization, consent, Order, license, permit or approval of, or
registration, declaration, notice or filing with, or notice to, any United
States, state of the United States or non-United States governmental or
regulatory agency, commission, court, body, entity or authority, other market
administrator, international treaty or standards organization, or national,
regional or state organization (each, a "Governmental Entity") is necessary,
under applicable Law, for the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or the consummation by Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except for such authorizations, consents, Orders, licenses, permits,
approvals or filings that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by Company of this Agreement do
not, and (assuming the Company Approvals are obtained) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not (i) result in any loss, suspension, limitation or impairment of any
right of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to own or use any assets required
for the conduct of their business or result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation, first offer, first refusal, modification
or acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a material
benefit under any Company Material Contract binding upon Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which or to which any of their respective properties,
rights or assets are bound or subject, or result in the creation of any liens,
claims, mortgages, encumbrances, pledges, security interests, equities or
charges of any kind (each, a "Lien") (other than Company Permitted Liens and
any Liens created in connection with any action taken by Buyer or its
affiliates), in each case, upon any of the properties or assets of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any contract to which Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective properties or
assets are bound, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any
provision of the Company Organizational Documents or (iii) conflict with or
violate any applicable Laws, except in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), for
such losses, suspensions, limitations, impairments, conflicts, violations,
defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations, or Liens as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

    

Section 3.3 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Company and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed with or furnished to
the SEC all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required
to be filed or furnished by it since January 1, 2018 (all such documents and
reports filed or furnished by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the "Company
SEC Documents") and Company has filed prior to the date hereof all material
returns, particulars, resolutions and documents required to be filed or to be
delivered on behalf of Company with the Registrar of Companies in Jersey. As
of their respective dates of filing or, in the case of Company SEC Documents
that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the
Securities Act, their respective dates of effectiveness, or, if amended prior
to the date hereof, as of the date of the last amended filing, the Company SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), as
the case may be, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
information set forth in the Company SEC Documents as of a later date (but
before the date hereof) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules thereto) of Company included in the Company SEC Documents (i) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash
flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and any other
adjustments described therein), (ii) were prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), (iii) are in accordance, in all
material respects with, the books and records of Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries and (iv) comply in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements and with the rules and regulations of the SEC, the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Companies Law.

 

(c) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments from, or unresolved issues
raised by, the staff of the SEC relating to the Company SEC Documents. Company
has heretofore made available to Buyer true, correct and complete copies of
all written correspondence between Company and the SEC occurring since January
1, 2019. None of the Company SEC Documents is, to the knowledge of Company,
the subject of ongoing SEC review, and no enforcement action has been
initiated against Company relating to disclosures contained in or omitted from
any Company SEC Document.

    

(d) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it
have any binding commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-
balance sheet partnership or any similar contract (including any contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of
such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Company or any of its Subsidiaries in Company's
financial statements or other Company SEC Documents.

 

Section 3.4 _Internal Controls and Procedures._ Company has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Company's disclosure controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Company's management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Company's management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Company's internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2018, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, management of
Company has disclosed to Company's auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of Company (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably expected to adversely affect in any material
respect Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud that is reasonably expected to adversely affect
in any material respect Company's financial reporting that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Company's internal control
over financial reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness and fraud so
disclosed to auditors, if any, has been disclosed to Buyer prior to the date
hereof.

 

Section 3.5 _No Undisclosed Liabilities._ There are no liabilities or
obligations of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether known or unknown
and whether accrued, absolute, determined or contingent, except for (i)
liabilities or obligations disclosed or reserved against in the most recent
balance sheet included in the Company Financial Statements (or in the notes
thereto) filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the
"Latest Balance Sheet"), (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in
accordance with or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since the date of the Latest
Balance Sheet, (iv) liabilities or obligations that have been discharged or
paid in full, (v) liabilities arising under the executory portion of any
Contract to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (other than
liabilities arising in connection with a breach of any such Contract) or (vi)
liabilities or obligations that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(a) Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with, and are not in
default under or in violation of, any applicable international, federal,
state, local or foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, convention,
treaty, judgment, Order, injunction, decree or agency requirement of any
Governmental Entity (collectively, "Laws" and each, a "Law"), except in each
case where such non-compliance, default or violation has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2018, neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Governmental
Entity regarding any actual or possible violation of, or failure to comply
with, any Law (or above policy), except as would not reasonably be expected to

authorizations, licenses, concessions, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals, clearances, permissions,
financial assurance instruments, qualifications and registrations and Orders

Material Contract with all Governmental Entities, and have filed all tariffs,
reports, notices and other documents with all Governmental Entities necessary
for Company and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties
and assets and to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted
(the "Company Permits"), except where the failure to have or to have filed
such Company Permits would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are
valid and in full force and effect and are not subject to any administrative
or judicial proceeding that could result in modification, termination or
revocation thereof, except where the failure to be in full force and effect or
any modification, termination or revocation thereof would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms
and requirements of all material Company Permits, except where the failure to
be in compliance would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) From December 31, 2018 through the date of this Agreement, except in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, the businesses of Company and its

business has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Company Material Adverse Effect (i) there are, to the knowledge of Company, no
investigations, actions, suits, proceedings (whether administrative or
judicial) pending or threatened in writing against Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any person or entity whose liability Company or any of its

law, alleging non-compliance with or other liability under any Environmental
Law, (ii) Company and its Subsidiaries are, and except for matters that have
been fully resolved with the applicable Governmental Entity, since January 1,

Permits required under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct their
respective business and operations, and compliance with the terms and
conditions thereof), (iii) there have been no Releases at any location of
Hazardous Materials by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to Company's
knowledge, as a result of any operations or activities of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their contractors or third-party operators, that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any fine, penalty, remediation,
investigation, obligation or liability of any kind to Company or its
Subsidiaries, (iv) none of Company and its Subsidiaries is subject to any
Order, or any indemnity obligation with respect to the liability of any other

303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of

Section 4.4 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Buyer has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Buyer's disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Buyer in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Buyer's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Buyer's management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Buyer's internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2018, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof management of Buyer
has disclosed to Buyer's auditors and the audit committee of the Board of
Directors of Buyer (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably expected to adversely affect in any material respect Buyer's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud that is reasonably expected to adversely affect in any material
respect Buyer's financial reporting that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Buyer's internal control over
financial reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed
to auditors, if any, has been disclosed to Company prior to the date hereof.

been discharged or paid in full, (v) liabilities arising under the executory
portion of any Contract to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party

are not subject to any administrative or judicial proceeding that could result
in modification, termination or revocation thereof, except where the failure
to be in full force and effect or any modification, termination or revocation

regarding Company and its Subsidiaries as Buyer may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a material violation of any
agreement to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would cause
a risk of a loss of privilege to Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would
constitute a violation of any applicable Law, or would constitute any
invasive, subsurface or any other testing, sampling or analysis at any
property or facility (commonly known as a Phase II).

 

(b) The Parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective officers, directors, employees or Representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed in accordance with the confidentiality
and non-disclosure agreement, dated as of August 20, 2019, between Company and
Buyer (as may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"),
the term of which is hereby extended until the earlier to occur of (x) the
Effective Time and (y) the first anniversary following the Termination Date.

    

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_ , Company shall, shall
cause each of its controlled affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors and employees to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their respective agents, financial advisors, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives (a person's officers,
directors, employees, agents, financial advisors, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives being collectively its
"Representatives") to: (i) immediately cease any solicitation, knowing
encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any person that is ongoing with
respect to or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
and promptly (and, in any event, within five business days of the date of this
Agreement) (x) other than with respect to Buyer and its Representatives,
terminate access to any virtual data room established for or used in
connection with any actual or potential Acquisition Proposal and (y) instruct
(to the extent it has contractual authority to do so and has not already done
so prior to the date of this Agreement) or otherwise request, any person that
has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement within the 12-month
period prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with any actual or
potential Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all such non-public
information or documents or material incorporating non-public information in
the possession of such person or its Representatives and (ii) until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the Termination Date, not, directly or
indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any
inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (2)
engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any other person any non-public information in
connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, an
Acquisition Proposal (in each case, other than (x) solely in response to an
unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to this _Section 5.3_ and
to limit its conversation or other communication exclusively to such referral
or (y) to seek to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal (or amended proposal) solely to determine if such
proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal), or (3) approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve,
recommend or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement, commitment or
agreement in principle (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement. Except in the event that the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith after consultation with Company's outside legal
counsel that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors
under applicable Law, Company and its Subsidiaries shall not release any third
party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission
under any standstill provision in any agreement to which Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party. Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
enforce any such standstill provisions.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_ ,
if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or their Representatives, directly or indirectly
receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from any person
that did not result from a material breach of _Section 5.3(a)_ , and if the
Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, then Company and any of its Subsidiaries, and any of its or
their Representatives, may, directly or indirectly, (i) furnish, pursuant to
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public
information) with respect to Company and its Subsidiaries, and afford access
to the business, properties, assets, employees, officers, contracts, books and
records of Company and its Subsidiaries, to the person who has made such
Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives and potential sources of
financing; _provided_ that Company shall substantially concurrently with the
delivery to such person provide to Buyer any non-public information concerning
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such
person or its Representatives unless such non-public information has been
previously provided or made available to Buyer, and (ii) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making
such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives and potential sources of
financing regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

     

(c) Company shall promptly notify Buyer, in writing, after receipt by Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their Representatives, of any
Acquisition Proposal, including of the identity of the person making the
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof, and shall
promptly provide unredacted copies to Buyer of any written proposals,
indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such Acquisition
Proposal. Company shall keep Buyer reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, as
to the status of (including changes to any material terms of, and any other
material developments with respect to) such Acquisition Proposal (including by
promptly providing to Buyer unredacted copies of any additional or revised
written proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating
to such Acquisition Proposal). Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries
will not enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of
this Agreement which prohibits Company from engaging in discussions with Buyer
or providing any information to Buyer in accordance with this _Section 5.3_.

 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3(d)_ or _Section 5.3(e)_
, or where required in order to implement the Transaction by way of an Offer
made in accordance with _Section 5.16_ , neither the Board of Directors of
Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Buyer the Company Board Recommendation or fail to make the
Company Board Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.4(l)_ (or, in the
period prior to publication of the Scheme Document, publicly change, withdraw
or modify its intention and expectation that it will give such
recommendation), (ii) following the date that an Acquisition Proposal (or any
material change thereto) has been made public, fail to reiterate the Company
Board Recommendation (or, in the period prior to publication of the Scheme
Document, fail to publicly reiterate its intention and expectation that it
will give the Company Board Recommendation) within 10 business days after a
written request by Buyer; _provided_ , that Buyer may make such request no
more than once after an Acquisition Proposal (or, in the event of one or more
material changes thereto, after any such material change) has been made
public, (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt,
approve or recommend, to Company Shareholders an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv)
fail to publicly recommend against a publicly announced Acquisition Proposal
(it being understood that a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act is permitted and
does not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change, and it being further
understood that the Board of Directors of Company may refrain from taking a
position with respect to such Acquisition Proposal until the close of business
as of the tenth business day after the commencement of such Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action
being considered an Adverse Recommendation Change) (any action described in
this _Section 5.3(d)_ being referred to as a "Adverse Recommendation Change").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained:

 

(i) the Board of Directors of Company may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or authorize Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case,
if, after receiving a bona fide, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a material breach of _Section 5.3(a)_ , the Board of Directors of
Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (A) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) in light of such Acquisition
Proposal, the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making
such Adverse Recommendation Change or effecting such termination, (1) Company
has given Buyer at least four business days' prior written notice of its
intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the material terms
and conditions of any such Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously
provided to Buyer a copy of the Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed
transaction agreements with the person making such Superior Proposal and a
copy of any financing commitments relating thereto that have been provided to
Company (or, if not provided in writing to Company, a written summary of the
material terms thereof to the extent known by Company), (2) Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Buyer during such notice period, to the extent Buyer wishes to negotiate,
to enable Buyer to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that
it would cause such Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, (3) following the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors
of Company shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of
this Agreement proposed in writing by Buyer, and shall have determined, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Buyer were to be given effect,
and (4) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms (including
the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material
terms of such Superior Proposal, Company shall, in each case, have delivered
to Buyer an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (1)
above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (1) of this proviso
shall commence (except that the four business day notice period referred to in
clause (1) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to two business days)
during which time Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of
this _Section 5.3(d)(i)_ anew with respect to such additional notice,
including clauses (1) through (4) above of this proviso; and _provided
further_ that Company has complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this _Section 5.3(d)_ ; and

     

(ii) the Board of Directors of Company may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of
Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors of Company under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, prior to making such Adverse Recommendation Change, (1)
Company has given Buyer at least four business days' prior written notice of
its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the basis for
such Adverse Recommendation Change, including a description of the facts and
circumstances relating to such Intervening Event), (2) Company has negotiated,
and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Buyer
during such notice period, to the extent Buyer wishes to negotiate, to enable
Buyer to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would
obviate the need to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event and (3) following the end of such notice period, the Board
of Directors of Company shall have considered in good faith any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Buyer, and shall have
determined, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change
would nevertheless be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Company under applicable Law.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit Company or the
Board of Directors of Company from (x) taking and disclosing to the Company
Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication or any other similar disclosure to the Company Shareholders
pursuant to the Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure to the Company
Shareholders if, in the reasonable determination in good faith of the Board of
Directors of Company, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the
failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to constitute a
breach of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law or that such disclosure
is otherwise required by applicable Law.

    

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings assigned below:

 

(i) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means any customary confidentiality
agreement that contains provisions as to confidentiality and non-use that are
no less restrictive in any material respect to the third party executing such
agreement than those applicable to Buyer that are contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that (i) such confidentiality agreement
shall not prohibit compliance by Company with any of the provisions of this
_Section 5.3_ and (ii) Company offers to waive the standstill restrictions in
the Confidentiality Agreement concurrently with executing any such
confidentiality agreement that does not contain standstill restrictions.

 

(ii) "Acquisition Proposal" means (A) any proposal or offer for or with
respect to a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
binding share exchange, joint venture, scheme of arrangement or other similar
transaction involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
assets that, taken together, constitute more than 20% of Company's
consolidated assets, (B) any proposal or offer (including tender or exchange
offers) to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, in one or more
transactions, more than 20% of the outstanding Company Ordinary Shares or
securities of Company representing more than 20% of the voting power of
Company or (C) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner (including the
acquisition of equity securities in any Subsidiary of Company), directly or
indirectly, in one or more transactions, assets or businesses of Company or
its Subsidiaries, including pursuant to a joint venture, representing more
than 20% of the consolidated assets, revenues or net income of Company, in
each case, other than the Transaction.

 

(iii) "Intervening Event" means a change, effect, event, development,
condition or occurrence that materially affects Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and that (i) was not known by, and was not reasonably
foreseeable by, the Board of Directors of Company as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii) does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
that in no event shall any of the following events constitute an Intervening
Event: (1) any change, in and of itself, in the trading price or trading
volume of the Company Ordinary Shares or Buyer Common Stock, or any change in
credit ratings or ratings outlook, in and of itself, for Buyer or Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries (but not including, in each case, the
underlying causes), (2) the fact, in and of itself, that Buyer or Company
exceeds or fails to meet or exceed analyst earnings projections, earnings
guidance or internal financial forecasts (but not including, in each case, the
underlying causes thereof); and (3) compliance with or performance under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(iv) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal (A) that if consummated would result in (x) a third party acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Company Ordinary
Shares or more than 50% of the assets of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (y) the shareholders of Company immediately prior to such
transaction ceasing to own, directly or indirectly, at least 50% of the equity
interests in the acquiring, surviving or parent company resulting from such
transaction, (B) that the Board of Directors of Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including all
conditions contained therein and the person making such Acquisition Proposal
and (C) that the Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel
(taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed by Buyer in
response to such Acquisition Proposal, and all financial, legal, regulatory
and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, including all conditions
contained therein and the person making such proposal, and this Agreement), is
more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company Shareholders than
the Transaction.

Arrangement_.

 

Company shall:

 

(a) take each of the actions listed in _Section 5.4(a)_ of the Company

(c) consult with Buyer as to the form and content of the Scheme Document and,
solely to the extent the Scheme Document reflects (i) terms that are
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement (including any obligations of
Buyer) or (ii) disclosures about Buyer (including communications or other
actions by Buyer) leading to execution of this Agreement, seek the approval of
Buyer (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
( _provided_ , that the terms of the Scheme of Arrangement shall be in all
material respects in the form set out in _Annex II_ subject to any amendment
that the Parties agree in accordance with _Section 5.7(b)_ ); _provided
further_ , that in no event shall Company's obligations pursuant to this

order to provide comments and take into consideration in good faith all
comments reasonably proposed by Buyer;

 

(e) not finalize or post the Scheme Document to the Company Shareholders

the Scheme of Arrangement or any variation or amendment to the Scheme of
Arrangement (a "Scheme Supplemental Document"), in each case prepared in

pertaining to the Scheme of Arrangement and any issues arising in connection
with it (except to the extent the barrister is to advise on matters relating
to the fiduciary duties of the directors of Company or otherwise in
circumstances where a conflict has arisen between the interests of Company and
Buyer);

 

(i) as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify Buyer of any matter of which
it becomes aware which would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent filing of the Scheme Document or the Court Documentation; _provided_
that any failure to comply with this _Section 5.4(i)_ shall not constitute a
breach or failure to perform by Company with respect to the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ , or give rise to any right of termination under
_Article VII_ ;

 

(j) as promptly as reasonably practicable, make all necessary applications to
the Court in connection with the implementation of the Scheme of Arrangement
(including applying to the Court for leave to convene the Scheme Meeting and
settling with the Court the Scheme Document, the Forms of Proxy and any Scheme

Supplemental Document to Company Shareholders on the Register of Members of
Company on the record date as agreed with the Court, as promptly as reasonably

procure that the Scheme Document includes the Company Board Recommendation;

 

(m) include in the Scheme Document a notice convening the Company GM to be
held immediately following the Scheme Meeting to consider and, if thought fit,
approve the Company Shareholder Resolutions and convene the Scheme Meeting and

or its Representatives, but not more than one time per day;

 

(p) except as required by applicable Law or the Court or pursuant to _Section
5.7(a)_ , not postpone or adjourn the Scheme Meeting and/or the Company GM;
_provided, however_ , that Company may, without the consent of Buyer and only
in accordance with the Company Articles of Association and applicable Law,
adjourn or postpone the Scheme Meeting and/or the Company GM (i) in the case
of adjournment, if requested by the Company Shareholders (on a poll) to do so,
_provided_ that the adjournment resolution was not proposed or instigated by
or on behalf of Company, (ii) to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Scheme Document is provided
to the Company Shareholders or to permit dissemination of information which is
material to the Company Shareholders voting at the Scheme Meeting and/or the
Company GM, but only for so long as the Board of Directors of Company has
determined in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary or advisable
to give the Company Shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any such
disclosure or information so provided or disseminated, or (iii) if, as of the
time for which the Scheme Meeting or the Company GM is scheduled (as set forth
in the Scheme Document), there are insufficient Company Ordinary Shares or
Company Shareholders represented (either in person or by proxy) (A) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Scheme Meeting or
the Company GM, but only until a meeting can be held at which there is a

the case of the Scheme Meeting) and all other Conditions are satisfied or
waived where applicable (with the exception of the condition set out in

the Court (including the Court Order) once obtained; and

 

(v) subject to the foregoing, take any other action reasonably necessary to

this Agreement (it being acknowledged that this requirement shall not extend,
in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change, to obliging Company to
convene or reconvene either the Scheme Meeting or the Company GM or conduct
any proxy solicitation).

 

Section 5.5 _Responsibilities of Buyer in Respect of the Scheme of
Arrangement_.

 

(a) Buyer shall:

 

(i) instruct a Jersey advocate to appear on its behalf at the Court hearing to
request the convening of the Scheme Meeting and the Court hearing to sanction
the Scheme of Arrangement and undertake to the Court to be bound by the terms
of the Scheme of Arrangement (including the issuance of the New Buyer Shares
pursuant thereto) insofar as it relates to Buyer, _provided_ that this shall
not oblige Buyer to waive any of the Conditions or treat them as satisfied;

 

(ii) subject to the terms of this Agreement, afford all such cooperation and
assistance as may reasonably be requested of it by Company in respect of the
preparation and verification of any document required for the implementation
of the Scheme of Arrangement, including the provision to Company of such
information and confirmations relating to it, its Subsidiaries and any of its
or their respective directors or employees as Company may reasonably request
(including for the purposes of preparing the Scheme Document or any Scheme
Supplemental Document) and to do so in a timely manner;

 

(iii) review and provide comments (if any) in a reasonably timely manner on
all such documentation submitted to it; and

 

(iv) as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify Company of any matter of
which it becomes aware which would reasonably be expected to materially delay
or prevent filing of the Scheme Document or the Court Documentation;
_provided_ that any failure to comply with this _Section 5.5(a)(iv)_ shall not
constitute a breach or failure to perform by Buyer with respect to the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , or give rise to any right of
termination under _Article VII_.

 

Section 5.6 _Proxy Statement_. Subject to _Section 5.4_ , as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, Company shall
(with the assistance and cooperation of Buyer as reasonably requested by
Company) take all action reasonably necessary to prepare, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents, as applicable, proxy
materials which shall constitute the Scheme Document and the proxy statement
relating to the Scheme Meeting and the Company GM for the purpose of passing
the Company Shareholder Resolutions (such proxy materials and proxy statement,
as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy Statement"). Unless
the Company Board of Directors shall have made an Adverse Recommendation
Change, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit or cause to
be solicited from its shareholders (including through a proxy solicitation
firm), in accordance with applicable Law and the rules and regulations of the
NYSE, proxies to secure the Company Shareholder Approval and take all other
reasonable actions necessary or advisable to secure the Company Shareholder
Approval. Buyer shall take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state or provincial securities Laws in connection with the issuance
of the New Buyer Shares in the Transaction. Buyer and Company shall furnish
all information concerning Buyer and Company, respectively, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the Proxy Statement (or any supplement
required thereto) and any such action as aforesaid. Other than in the case of
an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.3_ , no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by either Party
without providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (which comments shall be considered in good faith). Each Party
will advise the other Party promptly after it receives any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon
and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and
will promptly provide the other Party with copies of any written communication
from the SEC or any state securities commission with respect thereto. Each of
Company and Buyer shall ensure that the information provided by it for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement (and any supplement required thereto) at the
time of mailing thereof and at the time of the Scheme Meeting and the Company
GM will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and Company will ensure that the Proxy Statement (and any
supplement required thereto) at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of
the Scheme Meeting and the Company GM will (with the assistance and
cooperation of Buyer as reasonably requested by Company) comply as to form in
all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and any
applicable provisions of the Companies Law.

   

Section 5.7 _Mutual Provisions in Relation to the Scheme of Arrangement and
the Meetings_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer and
Company shall cooperate to schedule and convene the Scheme Meeting and Company
GM for the same date, it being understood and agreed that, if prior to any
scheduled meeting date, the Board of Directors of Company determines that
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, such Board
of Directors shall be permitted to adjourn or postpone the Scheme Meeting or
the Company GM (including any postponements or adjournments thereof), as
applicable, for up to ten business days. In connection with the Scheme
Meeting, Company shall take the actions set forth on _Section 5.7(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) If Buyer or Company acting reasonably considers that an amendment should
be made to the provisions of the Scheme of Arrangement or the Scheme Document
in order to implement the Transaction in as efficient a manner as practicable
or otherwise either prior to or after consideration by the Court, it may
notify the other Party and the Parties shall be obliged to consider and
negotiate, acting reasonably and in good faith, such amendment ( _provided,_
that no Party shall be required to consider and negotiate in good faith any
amendment that would materially and adversely affect it, its shareholders or
the likelihood of consummation of the Transaction and each Party recognizes
that any amendments may require the recommencement of the Court approval
process and/or a new notice of the Scheme Meeting to be sent).

 

Section 5.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Company and Buyer shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective the Transaction and enable the Closing to occur as promptly
as practicable (and in any event prior to the End Date), including (i) the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be
filed to consummate the Transaction and the provision of information in
connection therewith, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to consummating
the Transaction, (iii) subject to _Section 5.8(b)_ , taking all actions
necessary to obtain (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any
consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third
party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include
furnishing all information and documentary material required under the HSR Act
or other antitrust, competition, foreign investment or similar Laws outside of
the United States) required to be obtained or made by Company, Buyer or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates in connection with the Transaction
or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Transaction and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
Additionally, Company and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to fulfill
all conditions precedent to the Transaction and shall not take any action
after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission,
approval or consent from any such Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained
prior to Closing. In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants
contained in this _Section 5.8_ , to the extent that any third party notices,
consents, approvals or waivers under, or the transfers of, any Contracts or
Permits issued by any Governmental Entity are required as a result of the
execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transaction (including
Permits required pursuant to Environmental Laws), each of the Parties shall
give or cause their respective Subsidiaries to give any notices to third
parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their
reasonable best efforts to obtain such third party consents, approvals or
waivers and to effect such transfers, and the Parties shall provide regular
updates to each other regarding the status of such efforts.

   

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants contained in
this _Section 5.8_ (but subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section
5.8(b)_ ), each of Buyer and Company shall use its reasonable best efforts,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts,
to take or cause to be taken any and all steps and to make, or cause to be
made, any and all undertakings necessary to resolve objections, if any, that
any Relevant Authority may assert under the HSR Act and any other federal,
state or foreign Law designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for
the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or reduction of
competition (collectively, "Antitrust Laws") or that regulates foreign
investment ("Foreign Investment Laws") as set forth in _Section 5.8(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, with respect to this Agreement, and to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law or Foreign
Investment Law that may be asserted by any Relevant Authority with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, so as
to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event
prior to the End Date), which shall include each of the following actions to
the extent required: (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, license,
divestiture or disposition of any businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of Buyer, Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any equity interest in any joint venture held by Buyer,
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (ii) creating, terminating, or
divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Buyer,
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and (iii) otherwise taking or
committing to take any action that would limit Buyer's or Company's (or their
respective Subsidiaries') freedom of action with respect to, or their
respective ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses,
assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Buyer, Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or any equity interest in any joint venture
held by Buyer, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in each of
clauses (i) through (iii), as may be required in order to obtain all approvals
and consents required directly or indirectly under any Antitrust Law or
Foreign Investment Laws, or to avoid the commencement of any action or
proceeding to prohibit the Closing of the Transaction under any Antitrust Law
or Foreign Investment Laws, or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any action or proceeding seeking to prohibit the Closing or that would
reasonably be expected to delay the Closing beyond the End Date.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.8_ or otherwise in this Agreement
to the contrary, (A) Company shall not take any of the actions described in
the foregoing sentence without the prior written approval of Buyer (for the
avoidance of doubt, without limitation of Buyer's obligations hereunder), and
(B) neither Buyer nor Company shall be required to take, or agree to take, any
actions under this _Section 5.8_ unless (x) such action or agreement would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
Substantial Detriment and (y) the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon the Closing. In addition, Buyer shall defend through
litigation on the merits any claim, action, or proceeding asserted, whether
judicial or administrative, by any Governmental Entity or any other person in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order that
would prevent the consummation of the Transaction prior to the End Date. For
purposes of this _Section 5.8(b)_ , "Substantial Detriment" means a Company
Material Adverse Effect treating for this purpose the effects of all actions
required by this _Section 5.8(b)_ wherever imposed (whether on Buyer, Company,
and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries), as if they affected a company
the size of, and having the financial and operating metrics of, Company. For
the avoidance of doubt, "reasonable best efforts" for purposes of this
_Section 5.8(b)_ shall include the taking of the actions specified in _clauses
(i)_ through _(iii)_ above, subject to the limitations in the second sentence
of this _Section 5.8(b)_.

   

(c) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, Company and Buyer shall each keep
the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transaction and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required
consents, authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any
Governmental Entity set forth in _Section 5.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules and undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.8_. In
that regard, prior to the Closing, each Party shall promptly consult with one
another with respect to, and, except as prohibited by applicable Law, promptly
provide any necessary information with respect to (and, in the case of
correspondence, provide the other Party (or its counsel) copies of), all
filings made by such Party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such Party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction. Each Party shall
promptly inform the other Party, and if in writing, furnish the other Party
(or its counsel) with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications,
advise the other Party (or its counsel) orally of), any communication from any
Governmental Entity regarding the Transaction, and permit the other Party to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views and
comments of the other Party in connection with, any proposed communication
with any such Governmental Entity. If any Party or any Representative of such
Party receives a request for additional information or documentary material,
or other request for information, from any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Transaction, then such Party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other Party, an
appropriate response to such request. Neither Party shall participate in any
meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Entity where material issues
are reasonably expected to be discussed in connection with this Agreement and
the Transaction unless, so long as reasonably practicable and permitted by
applicable Law, it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat. Each Party shall furnish the other Party
with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental
Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Transaction, and furnish the
other Party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other Party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental
Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Party may, as it deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive materials
provided pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ as "outside counsel only," and
_provided further_ that materials may be redacted (i) to remove references
concerning the valuation of Company or Buyer and the Transaction or other
confidential information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

   

(d) Company and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than fifteen (15) business
days after the date of this Agreement, all notifications required under the
HSR Act; and (ii) make the other required foreign filings set forth on
_Section 5.8(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules as promptly as
practicable.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties
agree that they shall discuss the strategy for all filings, notifications,
submissions and communications in connection with any filing, notice,
petition, statement, registration, submission of information, application or
similar filing subject to this _Section 5.8_ ; _provided_ , however, that,
subject to Company's consultation and participation rights described in
_Section 5.8(c)_ , (i) Buyer shall devise such strategy for obtaining
clearances required with respect to any Antitrust Laws or Foreign Investment
Laws after considering in good faith all comments and advice of the Company,
and (ii) Buyer shall take the lead in all meetings, negotiations, and
communications with any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining such
clearances required under any Antitrust Laws or Foreign Investment Laws. For
avoidance of doubt, if there are multiple alternative remedies which may
result in obtaining regulatory clearance with respect to any of the filings
set forth on _Section 5.8(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule in accordance
with Buyer's obligations pursuant to _Section 5.8(b)_ , then Buyer shall have
sole discretion over which alternative(s) to initially propose.

 

Section 5.9 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions," or
"business combination" statute or regulation or other similar state or other
anti-takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the Transaction or any other transactions contemplated hereby,
each of Company and Buyer shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise take reasonable actions to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. Company and Buyer shall use reasonable
best efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each Party shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that all press releases and other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent
they have not been previously issued or disclosed, shall be consistent with
such joint communications plan. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, each Party shall consult with the other before issuing
any press release or public statement with respect to the Transaction and,
subject to the requirements of applicable Law (in the reasonable determination
in good faith of such Party, after consultation with outside legal counsel) or
the rules of any securities exchange (in the reasonable determination in good
faith of such Party, after consultation with outside legal counsel), shall not
issue any such press release or public statement prior to such consultation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company will not be obligated to engage in such
consultation with respect to communications that (i) are principally directed
to employees, suppliers, customers, partners or vendors so long as such
communications are consistent with prior press releases, public disclosures or
public statements in compliance with the first sentence of this _Section 5.10_
or (ii) principally relate to an Adverse Recommendation Change. Company and
Buyer agree to issue a mutually acceptable initial joint press release
announcing this Agreement.

   

Section 5.11 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
existing as at the date of this Agreement in favor of the current or former
managers, directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of Company or
its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of association or
other organizational documents or in any agreement or deed of indemnity shall
survive the Transaction, in each case, for any actions or omissions, or
alleged actions or omissions, occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a
period of six years from the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, Buyer shall maintain in effect any and all exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the articles of
association or similar organizational documents of Company and its
Subsidiaries in effect as at the date of this Agreement or in any
indemnification agreements of Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their
respective current or former directors, officers or employees in effect as at
the date of this Agreement, and to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions
or the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses provisions of
the organizational documents of Company or its Subsidiaries in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who
immediately before the Effective Time were current or former managers,
directors, officers or employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any
claim made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of
such Action or final resolution of such claim.

 

(b) Buyer shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing to) each current and former manager, director, officer or employee
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who served as a manager,
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise if such service was at the request or for the benefit of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such person's heirs, executors or
administrators, an "Indemnified Party"), in each case against any costs or
expenses (including advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking consistent with applicable Law and the
Company Organizational Documents to repay such amounts if it is ultimately
determined, in a final, non-appealable Order, that such person is not entitled
to indemnification), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (an "Action"), arising out of, relating to or
in connection with any action or omission by them in their capacities as such
occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such Indemnified Party
serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of any entity if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of Company). In the event
of any such Action, Buyer shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such Action.

   

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause to be
maintained in effect the coverage provided by policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance of Company
("DandO Insurance") with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to
have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged
to have been committed by such Indemnified Parties in their capacities as
such, and on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions,
retentions, limits and amounts) not less favorable than those of the DandO
Insurance. Company or Buyer (as Buyer elects) shall, prior to the Effective
Time, purchase a prepaid six year "tail" policy with respect to the DandO
Insurance providing coverage on the terms set out in the preceding sentence
("Tail Policy"); _provided_ , that in no event shall the cost of such policy,
if purchased by Company, exceed 200% of the annual premium payable by Company
prior to the date hereof in respect of Company's most recently bound policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance ("Cap Amount"); _provided further_ that if the cost of the Tail
Policy exceeds the Cap Amount and Buyer elects not to spend (or authorize
Company to spend) more than the Cap Amount, then the Party purchasing such
Tail Policy shall obtain the greatest coverage reasonably available for such
policy for the Cap Amount. If such a "tail policy" is purchased, Buyer shall
have no further obligations under this _Section 5.11(c)_ so long as such Tail
Policy remains in full force and effect during the six-year period following
the Effective Time.

 

(d) Buyer shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 5.11_.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 5.11_ shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party
may have under the articles of association or other organizational documents
of Company or its Subsidiaries or any other indemnification arrangement, the
Companies Law or otherwise.

 

(f) The obligations of Buyer under this _Section 5.11_ shall not be
terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (including their successors, heirs and legal
representatives) to whom this _Section 5.11_ applies without the consent of
such Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, (i) the Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 5.11_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries
of this _Section 5.11_ , and (ii) this _Section 5.11_ shall survive
consummation of the Transaction and shall be enforceable by such Indemnified
Parties and their respective successors and legal representatives against
Buyer and its successors and assigns, _provided_ , that if Buyer or any of its
successors and assigns (A) undergoes an acquisition (or is acquired) by way of
a merger, business combination, tender offer, restructuring, recapitalization
or otherwise, and is not the continuing or surviving person in such
transaction, or (B) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then proper provisions will be made so
that the successors and assigns of Buyer or any of its successors or assigns
shall assume all of the obligations of Buyer set forth in this _Section 5.11_.

 

Section 5.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any Party's
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Company or Buyer,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other Party's
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
each of Company and Buyer shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

   

Section 5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Company and
Buyer shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Company Ordinary Shares (including derivative securities with respect to
Company Ordinary Shares) or acquisitions of Buyer Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to Buyer, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.14 _Transaction Litigation_. Company shall promptly notify and give
Buyer the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against Company and/or its directors or executive
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Transaction. Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to
settle any litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement
against Company or its directors, executive officers or similar persons by any
shareholder of Company relating to this Agreement, the Transaction or any
other transaction contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of
Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

Section 5.15 _Listing Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the New Buyer Shares
to be issued in the Transaction and such other shares of Buyer to be reserved
for issuance in connection with the Transaction to be approved for listing on
the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) Each of Company and Buyer agrees to cooperate with the other Party in
taking, or causing to be taken, all action necessary to delist the Company
Ordinary Shares from the NYSE and terminate its registration under the
Exchange Act, _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall not be
effective until the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.16 _Scheme Implementation by Way of Offer_.

 

(a) If, prior to a Scheme Meeting, a takeover offer (under Article 116 of the
Companies Law) is made by any person not affiliated with Buyer or its
affiliates, Buyer may (in its sole discretion) elect to implement the
Transaction by way of a contractual takeover offer (the "Offer"), whether or
not the Scheme Document has been published, _provided_ that the Offer is made
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (with
any additions, deletions, modifications or amendments to such terms and
conditions as may be necessary as a result of a switch from the Scheme of
Arrangement to the Offer) and _provided_ that Buyer shall comply with clauses
(b) through (d) below. If the Parties agree to implement the Transaction by
way of an Offer in accordance with this _Section 5.16(a)_ , _Section 5.4_ and
_5.5_ shall cease to have any effect, and the terms and conditions set out in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be modified or amended in so far as is
necessary as a result of the switch from the Scheme of Arrangement to the
Offer.

 

(b) In the event that the Transaction is implemented by way of an Offer
pursuant to and in accordance with clause (a) above, Buyer shall prepare the
document to be dispatched to (amongst others) the Company Shareholders under
which any Offer would be made (the "Offer Document") and shall consult with
Company in relation to the preparation thereof. Buyer agrees to submit, or
procure the submission of, drafts and revised drafts of the Offer Document to
Company for review and comment and, where necessary, to discuss any comments
with Company for the purposes of preparing revised drafts. Buyer shall afford
Company sufficient time to consider the drafts and revised drafts of the Offer
Document and include in the Offer Document all comments reasonably proposed by
Company.

   

(c) Company shall afford all such cooperation and assistance as may reasonably
be requested of it by Buyer in respect of the preparation and verification of
any document required for the implementation of the Offer, including the
provision to Buyer of such information and confirmations relating to it, its
Subsidiaries and any of its or their respective directors or employees as
Buyer may reasonably request (including for the purposes of preparing the
Offer Document and any amendments or supplements to either the Offer Document)
and to do so in a timely manner; and shall review and provide comments (if
any) in a reasonably timely manner on all such documentation submitted to it.

 

(d) If the Transaction is implemented by way of an Offer pursuant to and in
accordance with clause (a) above and such Offer is to be registered under the
Securities Act, Buyer shall prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 with
respect to the New Buyer Shares (the "Registration Statement") and Buyer's and
Company's obligations in clauses (b) and (c) above shall equally apply to the
process for preparation of such Registration Statement.

 

(e) If the Transaction is implemented by way of an Offer pursuant to and in
accordance with clause (a) above:

 

(i) the acceptance condition to the Offer shall be set at 90% (or such lesser
percentage as Company and Buyer may agree) of the Company Ordinary Shares to
which the Offer relates;

 

(ii) Buyer shall ensure that, unless the Parties agree otherwise in writing,
the only conditions of the Offer shall be those set out in _Article VI_ (the
"Conditions") (with (i) the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ replaced
with the acceptance condition specified in _Section 5.16(e)(i)_ , and (ii) any
other additions, deletions, modifications or amendments to such conditions as
the Parties agree are reasonably necessary or desirable as a result of a
switch from the Scheme of Arrangement to the Offer);

 

(iii) Buyer shall keep Company informed, on a regular basis and in any event
as promptly as reasonably practicable following a request by Company or its
Representatives, of the number of Company Shareholders that have validly
returned their acceptance or withdrawal forms or incorrectly completed their
acceptance or withdrawal forms and the identity of such shareholders;

 

(iv) except where the Board of Directors of Company has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 5.3_ , (A)
the Board of Directors of Company shall duly and validly adopt a resolution
declaring that the Board of Directors of Company has resolved that it will
recommend that the Company Shareholders accept the Offer and such
recommendation shall be deemed to be the Company Board Recommendation; (B)
Company agrees that the Company Board Recommendation shall be included within
the Offer Document; and (C) neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any
committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Buyer the Company Board Recommendation; and

     

(v) any failure to provide the Company Board Recommendation in accordance with
clause _(iv)_ above shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

Section 5.17 _Transaction Implementation by Way of Merger_.

 

(a) The Parties may, in the circumstances set out in _Section 5.16(a)_ , prior
to any election by Buyer to implement the Transaction by way of an Offer under
such terms, agree to implement the Transaction by way of a merger pursuant to
Part 18B of the Companies Law (the "Merger"), rather than by way of a Scheme
of Arrangement and whether or not the Scheme Document has been published. If
the Parties agree to implement the Transaction by way of a Merger in
accordance with this _Section 5.17_ , the Parties shall enter into a merger
agreement on substantially the same terms as this Agreement but modified or
amended in so far as is necessary as a result of the switch from the Scheme of
Arrangement to the Merger and otherwise to incorporate the information
required by Article 127D of the Companies Law.

 

(b) For the purposes of the Merger, the merged company (as defined in Article
127A(1) of the Companies Law) shall be Company and the merging companies (as
defined in Article 127A(1) of the Companies Law) shall be:

 

(i) Company; and

 

(ii) a Jersey company to be incorporated by Buyer as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Buyer.

 

(c) If the Transaction is implemented by way of a Merger pursuant to and in
accordance with clause (a) above, Buyer and Company shall prepare the
Registration Statement in the same manner as described in _Section 5.16(d)_.

 

Section 5.18 _Securities Act Exemption_. For so long as the Transaction is
being implemented by way of the Scheme of Arrangement, the Parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the New Buyer Shares issued to the
Company Shareholders upon the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective to be
issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act and in
reliance on exemptions from registration under state "blue sky" or securities
Laws.

 

Section 5.19 _Post-Closing Benefits Program_.

 

(a) For one year following the Closing Date (the "Continuation Period"), Buyer
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide the Company Employees who
continue to be employees of Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries immediately
following the Closing with (i) base salary or base wage rate and cash
incentive compensation opportunity that in the aggregate, are no less
favorable than the base salary or base wage rate and cash incentive
compensation opportunity to the individual provided immediately prior to the
Closing date, (ii) equity-based or other long-term incentive opportunities
that are no less favorable than those provided to similarly-situated employees
of Buyer and its Affiliates, and (iii) employee benefits (other than equity-
based, defined benefit, or retiree medical benefits) that, taken as a whole,
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the employee benefits
(other than equity-based, defined benefit, or retiree medical benefits)
provided to either (i) such individuals immediately prior to the Closing Date
or (ii) similarly-situated employees of Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries, at
the sole discretion of Buyer (the "Post-Closing Benefits Program"). For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Post-Closing Benefits Program is
insufficient to provide compensation, benefits, and terms and conditions of
employment to any Company Employee who continues to be an employee of Buyer or
one of its Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing in compliance with
local Law or Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Post-Closing Benefits
Program shall be modified with respect to such Company Employee in order to so
comply.

    

(b) Buyer shall, or cause its Affiliates to, provide each Company Employee who
continues to be an employee of Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries immediately
following Closing and experiences a qualifying termination during the
Continuation Period with severance payments and other benefits following such
qualifying termination of employment no less favorable than those severance
payments and other benefits that such individual was eligible to receive
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plans established under the Post-
Closing Benefits Program, Buyer shall recognize and credit all service of
Company Employees and Buyer Employees with Company, Buyer or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or predecessor entities, as the case may be, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, accruals, and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (other than
benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan) to the extent such
service is recognized for similar purposes under the corresponding Benefit
Plan; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, this sentence is not
intended to allow Buyer to reduce any benefits that has been accrued prior to
the Closing Date under a Company Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan. With respect to the plan year during which Buyer causes
participation under welfare plans of Company Employees to change from coverage
under a Company Benefit Plan to coverage under another plan sponsored by Buyer
or its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall, (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek to waive any pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting
periods and evidence of insurability requirements, and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide credit for any co-payments and deductibles
incurred during such plan year prior to when such change occurs for purposes
of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements
under any such employee benefit plans established under the Post-Closing
Benefits Program with respect to the plan year in which such change occurs as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such employee benefit plans
established under the Post-Closing Benefits Program.

 

(d) Effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date but contingent upon the
Closing, Company shall cause to be approved board resolutions terminating
Company's U.S. Salaried Retirement Savings Program (the "Company 401(k) Plan")
unless Buyer provides written notice to Company no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date that the Company 401(k) Plan shall not
be terminated. Unless Buyer provides such written notice to Company, Company
shall provide Buyer copies of such board resolutions prior to the Closing.
Effective as of, or as promptly as administratively practicable following, the
Closing, each Company Employee in the U.S. shall be eligible to participate in
a tax-qualified defined contribution plan established or designated by Buyer
(the "Buyer 401(k) Plan"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Buyer
401(k) Plan. As promptly as practicable after the Closing and to the extent
not prohibited under applicable Law, Buyer shall take all action necessary to
provide that each Company Employee in the U.S. may elect to rollover his or
her full account balance (including cash, notes (in the case of loans), or a
combination thereof) in the Company 401(k) Plan to the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

    

(e) As soon as practicable prior to the Closing, Company shall determine in
good faith in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
whether and to what extent, after giving effect to expected performance
through the date of the Closing, the performance metrics and goals applicable
to the payment of awards under Company's Annual Incentive Plan for 2020 (the
"Company Bonus Plan") have been met. Based on such determination Company shall
determine, for each participant in the Company Bonus Plan, the amount of such
participant's bonus award for 2020, assuming such participant is employed for
the full 2020 performance year, which amount shall not be less than such
participant's target bonus award for 2020 (the "2020 Bonus Award Amount"), and
such 2020 Bonus Award Amounts shall be certified by the compensation committee
of the Company Board of Directors. For each participant who is a holder of a
Scheduled RSU Award or Scheduled PSU Award and is employed on the Closing Date
("Transitioning Employees"), such Transitioning Employee shall be paid his or
her 2020 Bonus Award Amount, pro-rated through the Closing Date or, if later,
pro-rated through the date after the Closing Date on which such Transitioning
Employee is scheduled to terminate employment, in each case, in a single lump
sum cash payment no later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer's, Company's or its applicable
Subsidiary's payment of the 2020 Bonus Award Amount in connection with the
Closing is prohibited under applicable Law, Buyer and Company will agree to an
alternative arrangement with respect to any such 2020 Bonus Award Amount
acting in good faith. Each participant who is not a Transitioning Employee and
who continues in employment through December 31, 2020 shall receive his or her
full 2020 Bonus Award Amount in a single lump sum cash payment, on or as soon
as reasonably practicable after December 31, 2020, but no later than March 15,
2021 and each participant who is not a Transitioning Employee who experiences
an "involuntary termination" prior to December 31, 2020 shall be paid his or
her 2020 Bonus Award Amount on or within fifteen (15) days following such
termination, pro-rated through the date of such involuntary termination. For
this purpose, an "involuntary termination" shall mean a termination of
employment due to death, due to a Qualified Termination (as defined in the
Company Bonus Plan) and, for employees who have other severance or equity
compensation arrangements providing for payments or benefits upon a
termination for good reason, a "good reason" termination (as defined therein).

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of foregoing, nothing in this _Section
5.19_ or _Section 5.20_ , express or implied: (i) is intended to confer any
rights, benefits or, remedies under this Agreement upon any person (including
any Company Employee or Buyer Employee) to continued employment, service or
any severance or other benefits from Company or Buyer or any of their
respective affiliates; (ii) is intended to require any Party (or any affiliate
thereof) to maintain any specific level of benefits for any Company Employees
or Buyer Employees for any specific period of time; (iii) shall be construed
as an amendment to any employee benefit plan or similar arrangement; or (iv)
shall constitute a limitation on the Parties' rights to amend, modify or
terminate, either before or after the Closing, any employee benefit plan or
similar arrangement.

 

Section 5.20 _Change in Control Arrangements_. As of the Effective Time, Buyer
shall automatically assume each change in control agreement listed on _Section
5.20_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Assumed CiC Agreements") and,
following the Effective Time, shall perform each Assumed CiC Agreement in the
manner and to the extent that Company would have been required to perform such
agreement had no assumption taken place.

    

Section 5.21 _Integration Planning_. Without limiting _Section 5.1_ , from and
after the execution of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ , except as may be required by Law (including Antitrust Laws),
(a) upon the reasonable advance written request of Buyer to Company, Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer
and its Subsidiaries to facilitate the integration of the Parties, their
respective Subsidiaries and their respective businesses following the Closing
and (b) without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (a), Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Representatives of
Company and its Subsidiaries to take reasonable actions and reasonably assist
Buyer with respect to integration planning and customer communications and
notices reasonably required to result in a successful transition and
integration following the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take such actions if: (A) it would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B)
it would cause a material violation of any agreement to which Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (C) Company believes in good faith, after
consulting with outside counsel and taking into account whether privilege
cannot be protected by Company or its Subsidiaries through exercise of its
reasonable efforts (such as redaction of certain information), it would
reasonably be expected to cause a risk of a loss of privilege to Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law.

 

Section 5.22 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use
their respective reasonable best efforts, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their Representatives to use their respective
reasonable best efforts, to provide all cooperation that is reasonably
requested by Buyer in writing and that is customary in connection with Buyer
obtaining third-party debt financing for the purpose of financing any amounts
required to be paid, or issuing new debt in exchange for any of Company's

foregoing, each Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available
to it, at law or in equity, as provided for in the Confidentiality Agreement
or that certain Joint Defense, Common Interest and Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of December 30, 2019, entered into between the Parties (the "Joint
Defense Agreement").

    

Section 7.3 _Termination Fee; Expenses_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_ , Company shall pay to Buyer the Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to
an account designated in writing by Buyer) in immediately available funds
within three business days after the date of termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) If (i) this Agreement is validly terminated by (A) either Buyer or Company
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ , (B) Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ or (C)
either Buyer or Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ , (ii) at any time after
the date of this Agreement and (A) prior to the Scheme Meeting, in the case of
a termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ or (B) prior to the termination of
this Agreement, in the case of a termination pursuant to _Sections 7.1(b)_ or
_(f)_ , an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made publicly or shall have
otherwise become publicly known, and (iii) within 12 months after such
termination, Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or shall have consummated any Acquisition
Proposal, then, in any such event, Company shall pay to Buyer the Termination
Fee, such payment to be made within three business days from the earlier of
the entry into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal or the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. For the purpose of this _Section 7.3(b)_ , all
references in the definition of the term Acquisition Proposal to "20%" will be
deemed to be references to "50%".

 

(c) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Company or Buyer pursuant to
_Section 7.1(i)_ , then Company shall, substantially concurrently with such
termination pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer the Termination Fee by wire
transfer (to an account designated by Buyer) in immediately available funds.

 

(d) "Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to $53,500,000.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Termination
Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this _Section 7.3_ , from
and after such termination and acceptance of payment of the Termination Fee by
Buyer pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 7.3_ , Company shall
have no further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this
Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under
this _Section 7.3._ Each of the Parties hereto agrees and acknowledges that
the Termination Fee is not a penalty and that it will not be entitled to argue
that the Termination Fee is unenforceable or should be reduced in any manner,
but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate, and
are proportionate to the legitimate interests of, Buyer in the circumstances
in which such Termination Fee is due and payable, in view of the efforts and
resources of Buyer expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall Buyer
be entitled to more than one payment of the Termination Fee in connection with
a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which the Termination Fee is
payable.

 

(e) Each of Company and Buyer acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that, without these agreements, Company and Buyer would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Company fails to pay in a timely manner
any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ , then (i) Company shall
reimburse Buyer for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of
such overdue amount, including in connection with any related Actions
commenced and (ii) Company shall pay to Buyer interest on such amount from and
including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of
actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.

the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated
by a Party hereto without the prior written consent of the other Party.

binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted
under this _Section 8.8_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the exhibits
hereto, schedules hereto, the Joint Defense Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and,
subject to _Section 5.11_ , this Agreement is not intended to grant standing
to any person other than the Parties hereto. In the event of any inconsistency
or conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Scheme of
Arrangement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail and govern.

 

Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, on
behalf of each of Company and Buyer (pursuant to authorized action by the
Board of Directors of Company and Board of Directors of Buyer, respectively);
_provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE require further approval
of the Company Shareholders or the Buyer Shareholders, as the case may be, the
effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of
the Company Shareholders or the Buyer Shareholders, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any Party hereto in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder.

    

Section 8.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this

Section 8.13 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) Each of Company and Buyer agrees that (i) their respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other Party hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) except for the provisions of
(x) _Section 5.11_ (the "DandO Third Party Rights Clauses") and (y) _Sections
2.2, 2.3_ , and _2.7_ (the "Equityholder Third Party Rights Clauses", together
with the DandO Third Party Rights Clauses, the "Third Party Rights Clauses"),
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other
than the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Third Party Rights Clauses confer a
benefit on the Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 5.11_ , holders of
Company Ordinary Shares in respect of _Sections 2.2_ and _2.7_ , and holders
of Company Equity Awards in respect of _Section 2.3_ , in each case, who are
not a Party (each for the purposes of this clause, "Third Party") and, subject
to the remaining provisions of this clause, are intended to be enforceable by
the Third Party.

 

(c) The Parties do not intend that any term of this Agreement, apart from the
Third Party Rights Clauses which are enforceable by the applicable Third
Party, should be enforceable, by any person who is not a Party.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (a) and (b) above, save in
respect of the Third Party Rights Clauses, this Agreement may be rescinded or
varied in any way and at any time by the Parties without the consent of any
Third Party.

 

Section 8.14 _Remedies._

 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by Law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The Parties recognize and agree that if for any reason any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached or violated, immediate and
irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not
be an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, each Party agrees that, in addition
to all other remedies to which it may be entitled, each of the Parties is
entitled to a decree of specific performance to enforce the terms of this
Agreement and shall further be entitled to an injunction restraining any
violation or threatened violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement
without the necessity of posting a bond or other form of security. In the
event that any Proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce any of the
provisions of this Agreement, no Party will allege, and each Party hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy under applicable Law.

    

(ii) Each Party agrees and acknowledges that the rights to specific
performance under _Section 8.14(b)(i)_ are an integral part of the Transaction
and without that right, neither Company nor Buyer would have entered into this
Agreement.

received access and are able to view such information, document or material)
or otherwise delivered (e-mail being sufficient) to such other Party or its
outside legal counsel, in each case, prior to the execution of this Agreement.
