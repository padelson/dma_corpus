required to be made at or prior to the Closing pursuant to Article VI hereof,
(i) the Seller shall sell, assign and transfer to the Buyer all of the
Seller\'s right, title and interest in and to the Interests free and clear of
all Liens, with all taxes attributable to the transfer of such Interests duly
paid or provided for by the Seller, and (ii) the Buyer shall (A) pay to the
Seller cash in an amount equal to the Preliminary Purchase Price minus the
Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds, (B) assume the
Assumed Obligations pursuant to an assumption agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Seller and (C) deposit the Escrow Amount in
accordance with Section 2.6.   SECTION 2.4. Adjustment Amount and Payment.
The Preliminary Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased by the
Adjustment Amount in accordance with this Section 2.4. The "Adjustment
Amount" (which may be a positive or negative number) will be equal to the
amount determined by subtracting the Closing Net Asset Value from the Target
Net Asset Value. If the Adjustment Amount is positive, then the Adjustment
Amount shall be paid by wire   -9-    transfer of immediately available
funds by the Seller to an account specified by the Buyer, net of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount paid to the Buyer pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.
If the Adjustment Amount is negative, then the Adjustment Amount shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds by the Buyer to an
account specified by the Seller. The payment of the Adjustment Amount shall
be made together with interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum,
which interest shall begin accruing on the Closing Date and end on the date
on which the payment of the Adjustment Amount is made. Within three Business
Days after the calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value becomes binding and
conclusive on the parties pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement, the
Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be, shall pay the Adjustment Amount as
provided for in this Section 2.4. The Preliminary Purchase Price as so
adjusted is referred to herein as the "Purchase Price".   SECTION 2.5.
Adjustment Procedure.   (a) "Net Asset Value" as of a given date shall mean
the amount calculated by subtracting the liabilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis from the assets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, in each case determined
in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Seller\'s
past practice (except as expressly required otherwise by the terms of
this Agreement) and prepared on the same basis and using the same
accounting principles, policies and practices used in the Financial
Statements.   (b) Within 60 days following the Closing Date, the Buyer (i)
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, financial statements (the "Closing
Financial Statements") of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis as of the close of business on the Closing Date and for
the period from December 31, 2001 through the close of business on the
Closing Date on the same basis and applying the same accounting principles,
policies and practices that were used in preparing the Financial Statements,
including the principles, policies and practices set forth on Schedule 2.5
(determined on a pro forma basis as though the parties had not consummated
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); (ii) shall determine the
Net Asset Value as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Net Asset Value") based
on the Closing Financial Statements and using the same methodology as was
used to prepare the Financial Statements, including the principles, policies
and practices set forth on Schedule 2.5; and (iii) shall deliver to the
Seller a signed statement that includes the Closing Financial Statements and
the Buyer\'s calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value.   (c) If (i)
within 60 days following the Closing Date, the Buyer delivers to the Seller
the Closing Financial Statements and the Buyer\'s calculation of the Closing
Net Asset Value and (ii) within 60 days following the delivery by the Buyer
to the Seller of the documents described in clause (i) above (the "Objection
Period"), the Seller has not delivered to the Buyer (A) a written notice (the
"Objection Notice") stating the Seller\'s objection to the Buyer\'s
calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value and the basis for such objection
and (B) a signed statement that includes the Seller\'s calculation of the
Closing Net Asset Value, then the Closing Net Asset Value calculated by the
Buyer shall be binding and conclusive on the parties. During the Objection
Period, the Buyer (1) shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Seller such work papers and other documents and information relating to the
Closing Financial    -10-    Statements and the Buyer\'s calculation of
the Closing Net Asset Value as the Seller may request and are available to
the Buyer or its agents, including consolidating financial statements, work-
in-progress schedules, receivables agings and a schedule of adjustments, and
(2) shall promptly respond in reasonable detail to reasonable inquiries by
the Buyer with respect to such work papers, documents and information.  
(d) If, during the Objection Period, the Seller delivers to the Buyer each of
the Objection Notice and the Seller\'s calculation of the Closing Net Asset
Value, then the Buyer and the Seller will use reasonable efforts to agree
upon the calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value. If the parties fail to
agree upon the calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value within 30 days
of the Buyer\'s receipt of the Objection Notice and the Seller\'s calculation
of the Closing Net Asset Value, then the Buyer and the Seller shall submit
the matter to PricewaterhouseCoopers in Washington, D.C., certified
public accountants (the "Independent Accountants"), for resolution applying
the principles, policies and practices set forth in Section 2.5(b). If
the determination of the Closing Net Asset Value is submitted to the
Independent Accountants for resolution, each of the Seller and the Buyer (A)
shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to the Independent
Accountants such work papers and other documents and information relating to
the Closing Financial Statements and its calculation of the Closing Net Asset
Value as the Independent Accountants may request and are available to such
party or its agents and (B) shall be afforded the opportunity to present to,
and discuss with, the Independent Accountants any material relating to the
Closing Financial Statements and its calculation of the Closing Net Asset
Value. Within 60 days following the submission of such matter to the
Independent Accountants, the Independent Accountants shall determine whether
the Buyer\'s calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value or the Seller\'s
calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value more closely approximates the Net
Asset Value as of the Closing Date based on the principles, policies and
practices set forth in Section 2.5(b). Immediately following such
determination, the Independent Accountants shall provide written notice of
their determination that (1) the Buyer\'s calculation of the Closing Net
Asset Value or the Seller\'s calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value, as
the case may be, more closely approximates the Net Asset Value as of the
Closing Date based on the principles, policies and practices set forth in
Section 2.5(b) and (2) such closer approximation of the Net Asset Value as of
the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the Closing Net Asset Value for all
purposes of this Agreement, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties and shall be used in computing the Adjustment Amount. The sole duty
of the Independent Accountants shall be to determine whether the Buyer\'s
calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value or the Seller\'s calculation of
the Closing Net Asset Value more closely approximates the Net Asset Value as
of the Closing Date based on the principles, policies and practices set forth
in Section 2.5(b) and to provide written notice of such determination to the
parties in accordance with this Section 2.5(d).   The Buyer and the Seller
shall split all the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants.  
SECTION 2.6. Escrow Amount. On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deposit the
Escrow Amount with Bank One National Association (or other institution
selected by the Seller with the reasonable consent of the Buyer), as escrow
agent, such deposit to be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the

against, all expenses and Liability, including attorneys\' fees, if
applicable, incurred under the WARN Act or any other Law requiring notice
prior to termination of employment with respect to any employee who
experiences a layoff, employment termination, reduction in hours or other
employment related loss prior to the Closing.   SECTION 7.5. Litigation
Support. In the event and for so long as any party actively is contesting or
defending against any Action in connection with (i) any transaction   
-39-    contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving any of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, the other
party will cooperate with it and its counsel in the contest or defense, make
available their personnel, and provide such testimony and access to their
books and records as shall be necessary in connection with the contest or
defense, all at the sole cost and expense (including reimbursement for any
wages or other out-of-pocket expenses relating to providing such support) of
the contesting or defending party (unless the contesting or defending party
is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article X). Notwithstanding the
provisions of the preceding sentence, to the extent a claim under any Action
is within the deductible amount covered by insurance, the other party shall
provide such reasonable cooperation as such party would be obliged to provide
to an insurance company if such claim exceeded the deductible without
any reimbursement obligations by the party contesting or defending such
Action so long as such cooperation does not interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of such other party\'s business.   SECTION 7.6. Transition. Neither
the Buyer nor the Seller will take any action that is designed or intended to
have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer, supplier, or
other business associate of any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
from maintaining the same business relationships with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries after the Closing as it maintained with the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. The Seller will refer all
customer inquiries relating to the businesses of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Buyer from and after the Closing.   SECTION 7.7. Third
Party Indemnification. To the extent that any Company Subsidiary does not
have direct contractual indemnification rights against a third party under
the Predecessor Acquisition Agreements, the Seller will pursue any and all
such indemnification rights on behalf of the Buyer at the request of the
Buyer.   SECTION 7.8. Assumed Obligations. Effective as of the Closing
Date, the Buyer hereby assumes all the Assumed Obligations.   SECTION 7.9.
Minute Books. Promptly after the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to
the Buyer all the minute books of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and their predecessors, including all stock registers, corporate seals and
related materials and all other books and records pertaining to the
respective businesses of the Company Subsidiaries.   SECTION 7.10. Use of
Name. The Seller hereby grants to the Buyer and its Subsidiaries a non-
exclusive license to use the names "Comfort Systems USA, Inc.", "Comfort
Systems" and any derivative or other names currently used by any of the
Company Subsidiaries that are not owned by such Company Subsidiaries (the
"Comfort Names") until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, as or as
part of any trade name, corporate name, domain name, trademark, service mark,
logo, design or other source indicator appearing on the assets, products or
materials owned or used by the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date. The Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to remove, redact,
strike through or cover the Comfort Names from any such assets, products or
materials before the first anniversary of the Closing Date; provided that
Buyer and its Subsidiaries may continue to use the Comfort Names in a   
-40-    neutral, non-trademark sense to communicate the historical
affiliation of the Company Subsidiaries.   SECTION 7.11. Vehicle Leases.
The Seller at its own expense shall transfer leases for each vehicle
currently used by a Company Subsidiary and not leased directly by such
Company Subsidiary to such respective Company Subsidiary. The Buyer shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all credit approvals that are
necessary in connection with the assignment of any vehicle leases. To the
extent any such lease cannot be transferred by its terms, the Seller at its
own expense shall purchase such vehicle and lease such vehicle to the
applicable Company Subsidiary on terms that are identical to the original
lease.   SECTION 7.12. Audit. From and after the Closing Date, the
Seller agrees that (a) it shall cooperate with, and provide reasonable access
to, the Buyer in the planning and execution of any audit of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries that may be required after the Closing under the
Exchange Act, and (b) shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
consents and authorizations from its accountants necessary to permit the
Buyer to incorporate such financial statements in preparing any of the
Buyer\'s filings under the Exchange Act.   SECTION 7.13. Tax Treatment of
the Company. The Buyer will not take any action (including the filing of an
IRS Form 8832 on which the Buyer elects to have the Company treated as a
corporation) that could cause the Company to be characterized for federal or
state income tax purposes as a corporation during any period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date.   SECTION 7.14. Surety
Bonds. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace those
surety bonds listed on Schedule 7.14 or any replacement bonds thereof for
which the Seller is the indemnitor.   SECTION 7.15. National Servicing
Organization Transition Issues. With respect to Comfort Systems USA National
Service Organization, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NSO"), the parties agree
as follows:   (a) For a period of one year from the Closing Date, the Seller
shall cause the NSO to offer work for its national service account
clients ("Clients"), whether such national account clients are currently or
hereafter become clients of the NSO, to the Company Subsidiaries in the same
manner as such work is currently offered to Subsidiaries of the Seller
whether or not such Subsidiaries are Company Subsidiaries. In the case of
work for existing Clients, the rates payable by the NSO to the Company
Subsidiaries shall be no less favorable to the Company Subsidiaries than
those presently offered by the NSO to the Subsidiaries of the Seller for
comparable work and the terms of payment shall be commercially reasonable and
no less favorable to the Company Subsidiaries than those presently offered by
the NSO to third parties for comparable work. In the case of work for new
Clients or for different types of work for existing Clients, the rates
offered to be paid by the NSO to the Company Subsidiaries and the terms of
payment shall be fair and reasonable under the circumstances, and in no event
no less favorable to the Company Subsidiaries than those offered from time to
time by the NSO to the Subsidiaries of the Seller or to unrelated parties of
the Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing,    -41-    nothing
contained herein shall require (i) any Company Subsidiary to accept NSO work
offered to it by the NSO, (ii) the NSO to accept work assignments from
Clients with respect to work assignments on which the NSO reasonably expects
to lose money or (iii) the NSO to accept work assignments from any Client
which, in the NSO\'s reasonable judgment, the NSO believes may be unable or
unwilling to pay for such work on reasonably commercial terms. The
Buyer shall cause each Company Subsidiary offered a work assignment by the
NSO to respond promptly to the NSO whether such Company Subsidiary is willing
to accept such work assignment. The NSO shall not be required to offer work
to any Company Subsidiary where the rate to be received by the NSO from
the Client is less than the acceptable hourly rate specified by the
Company Subsidiary from time to time.   (b) With respect to work that has
been or may be undertaken pursuant to contracts or other arrangements between
the NSO and Bank One for performance within one year of the Closing Date in
the states of Ohio or Indiana or in the greater Detroit, Michigan
metropolitan area, the Seller shall cause such work assignments to be offered
to Shambaugh and Son L.P. or its direct or indirect subsidiaries (collectively,
"SandS;") at the rates that have been previously quoted in writing by SandS; to
the NSO (the "Rates") and on terms of payment that are fair and reasonable
under the circumstances. However, the Buyer acknowledges that it has been
advised by the Seller that the terms for performing work for Bank One have
not yet been agreed to between the NSO and Bank One, and, accordingly, under
the circumstances the NSO may request that the Rates be reduced. The NSO
shall consult with SandS; on, and keep SandS; advised on the status of,
negotiations between the NSO and Bank One as to rates and related matters. In
the case of rates negotiated between Bank One and SandS; that would result in a
reduction of the Rates, the NSO shall negotiate such proposed reduction in
good faith with SandS;, and the Buyer shall cause SandS; to negotiate such
reduction in good faith with the NSO. Nothing herein contained shall require
SandS; to perform work for Bank One at such reduced rates or require SandS; to
perform any type of work assignments for Bank One. The Buyer shall cause SandS;
to respond promptly to the NSO as to whether SandS; is willing to accept any
work assignment for Bank One offered to it by the NSO.   (c) The Buyer and
the Seller acknowledge that the Company Subsidiary, American Mechanical, Inc.
("AMC"), and the Seller have, in the past, shared two employees with respect
to NSO work, and that from and after the Closing Date such two employees
shall be employed solely by AMC. For a period of two years after the Closing
Date, the Seller shall not solicit such employees to work for the Seller or
any of its Affiliates so long as such employees remain employees of AMC or
seek to influence them to leave the employ of AMC. The NSO shall continue to
offer work to AMC as provided in subsection (a) hereof. The Seller will make
available to AMC any data in the Seller\'s possession with respect to any
customers that originated with AMC and for which AMC currently performs, or
within the last three years has performed, work. The Seller shall assign to
the Buyer all right, title and interest in the name of "American Mechanical
Network" ("AMN") or any variation thereof, the telephone numbers for AMN and
the clients of AMN set forth on Schedule 7.15(c) ("AMN Clients"). In the
event any AMN Client contacts the Seller or any of its Affiliates for
services after the Closing Date, the Seller shall, and shall cause any such
Affiliate to, refer such AMN Client to AMC for such requested services.
For    -42-    the period of six months after the Closing Date, the
Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, solicit the
business of any AMN Client.   (d) For a period of six months after the
Closing Date, the Company Subsidiary, Kuempel Service, Inc. ("Kuempel") shall
sublet to the NSO the premises in Cincinnati, Ohio presently sublet to the
NSO by Kuempel. Such premises shall be sublet at the rate of $10,213.00 per
month, on terms and conditions contained in a draft of sublease initialed by
the parties on the date hereof and to be executed on the Closing Date.  
SECTION 7.16. Continuation of Insurance Coverage. The Seller shall maintain
insurance policies covering each of the Company Subsidiaries for a period of
three years after the Closing Date with respect to professional liability
(errors and omissions), contractors\' pollution and employment practices on
terms and conditions, including coverage and exclusions, substantially
similar to those in effect prior to the Closing. Within 30 days after the end
of each fiscal year, the Seller shall provide evidence to the Buyer that such
policies are in full force and effect. Within 30 days prior to the renewal
date of each such insurance policy, the Seller shall provide evidence to the
Buyer that such policies have been renewed and shall provide copies of such
renewed policies to the Buyer. The Seller agrees to provide copies of any
written notices or correspondence that the Seller may receive from each
insurance provider, including but not limited to notices or correspondence
relating to a failure by the Seller to comply with the applicable terms of
the insurance policies or relating to any actual or anticipated changes or
modifications to coverage, limits, terms, conditions, exclusions and
insureds. In the event the Seller fails to comply with the provisions of this
Section 7.16, including but not limited to a failure to renew any insurance
policy on or prior to its applicable renewal date, the Seller shall promptly
provide written notice of such failure to the Buyer.   SECTION 7.17. Bonding
Company Reports. The Buyer will cause each Company Subsidiary (i) to prepare
and forward to Federal Insurance Company (Chubb) ("Chubb") job status
reports, at such intervals as each Company Subsidiary has previously
submitted such reports, indicating, in the case of completed contracts, the
final contract price and, in the case of uncompleted contracts, the then
currently estimated completion date and the then percentage of the contract
completed and such other information as Chubb may reasonably request
concerning bonded jobs and (ii) with respect to each job as to which a
performance bond has been issued by Chubb prior to the Closing Date, upon
completion of each such job, to use its best efforts to obtain evidence of
substantial completion of each such job from the party with whom such Company
Subsidiary contracted and forward such evidence to Chubb.   SECTION 7.18.
Pre-Closing Financial Reporting. Within 40 days after the end of the quarter
during which the Closing occurs, the Buyer will cause each Company Subsidiary
to prepare and send to the Seller the financial statements of such Company
Subsidiary, in substantially the form heretofore prepared by the Company
Subsidiaries for the Seller, for the period January 1, 2002 to the Closing
Date.   SECTION 7.19. Transfer of Domain Names. As soon as practicable,
but in any event no later than 45 days after the Closing Date, the Seller
shall transfer to each Company Subsidiary all right, title and interest in
the domain names that are owned by the Seller relating to   
-43-    the business of each respective Company Subsidiary, including
all registrations, reservations and applications relating thereto (including
any of the foregoing at new gTLD registrars and registries), except domain
names that incorporate the words, "Comfort", "Comfort Systems" or "CSUSA" and
domain names that are applicable to all the Retained Subsidiaries. The Seller
agrees not to apply to register or reserve any additional domain names that
are the same as, or similar to, such domain names at any time. At the
reasonable request of the Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, the
Seller shall take all actions and execute all documents necessary or
desirable to facilitate the above transfer.   ARTICLE VIII  TAX
MATTERS   SECTION 8.1. Tax Indemnification.   (a) The Seller shall be
responsible for, shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer from and against any and all Losses for or in respect of
each of the following, without duplication: (i) any and all liability for
Taxes of the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable
periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (a "Pre-
Closing Tax Period") and with respect to any taxable period that begins on or
before and ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), for the portion
thereof ending on the Closing Date; (ii) all liability (as a result of
Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law or as a transferee or successor by contract or otherwise) imposed
on the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for the Taxes of the Seller
or any other person or entity (other than the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries) which is or has been an Affiliate of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date; (iii) any and all liability
for Taxes attributable to the making of Elections (as described under Section
8.9(a)) and any Taxes arising out of any failure by the Seller to pay such
Tax; (iv) all Taxes arising out of a breach of any representation or warranty
set forth in Section 5.17 other than Section 5.17(b), (v) any payment to be
made after the Closing Date under any Tax sharing, Tax indemnity, Tax
allocation or similar contract (whether or not written and in each case
covering the sharing of income or income-based taxes reported on a combined,
unitary or consolidated Tax Return) to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries was obligated or was a party on or prior to the Closing
Date, and (vi) all liability for reasonable legal fees and other third-party
expenses for any item attributable to any item in clause (i) through (v)
above.   (b) The Buyer shall be liable for and shall indemnify the Seller
for (i) all liability for Taxes of the Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries for any taxable period or portion thereof beginning
after the Closing Date and, with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of
such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing
Tax Period"), (ii) any Taxes to the extent that such Taxes were paid with
respect to periods after the Closing by the Seller and not reflected as an
asset on the Most Recent Balance Sheet (in which case the amount of such
Taxes shall be subject to indemnification when such Taxes would otherwise
have become due and payable), (iii) any Taxes attributable to any failure by
the Buyer to make any Election and    -44-     (iv) all liability for
reasonable legal fees and other third-party expenses for any item
attributable to any item in clause (i), (ii) or (iii).   (c) Payment of any
amount due under this Section 8.1 shall be made within thirty days following
written notice by the other party that payment of such amounts to the
appropriate taxing authority is due. In the case of a Tax that is contested
in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.2, payment of Tax to the
appropriate taxing authority will not be considered to be due earlier than
the date a final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate
taxing authority or a court.   (d) For purposes of this Section 8.1,
whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries for a portion of a Straddle Period:   (i) in
the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or  related to income or
receipts, such Tax shall be deemed to be the  amount of such Tax for the
entire Taxable period multiplied by a  fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days during the  Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period or  Post-Closing Tax Period, as applicable, and the denominator of
which  is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; and   (ii) all
other Taxes for the Pre-Closing Period or Post-Closing  Period, as the case
may be, shall be determined by assuming that for  purposes of the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries had a taxable year or
period that ended at the close of  the Closing Date and for purposes of the
Post-Closing Period, the  Company and the Company Subsidiaries had a taxable
year or period  that began at the beginning of the day after the Closing
Date.   SECTION 8.2. Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax
Claims.   (a) If an audit, investigation or similar proceeding with respect
to Tax matters shall be commenced, or a claim shall be made, by any
taxing authority, which might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to
Section 8.1, the party receiving notice of such audit, investigation, similar
proceeding or claim shall promptly notify the other party in writing of such
audit, investigation, similar proceeding or claim (a "Tax Proceeding");
provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification obligations under Section 8.1 unless such failure materially
prejudices the indemnifying party.   (b) With respect to any Tax Proceeding
which might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 8.1(a), the
Seller shall have the right to control all proceedings taken in connection
with such Tax Proceeding (including selection of counsel) and, without
limiting the foregoing, may with the consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing
authority with respect thereto, and may, in its reasonable discretion, either
pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such
refund suits or contest the Tax Proceeding in any permissible manner. The
Buyer shall be entitled to participate    -45-    in all proceedings
with respect to any such Tax Proceeding (at its expense) and to employ
counsel of its choice for such purpose.   (c) With respect to any Tax
Proceeding which might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section
8.1(b), the Buyer shall have the right to control all proceedings taken in
connection with such Tax Proceeding (including selection of counsel) and,
without limiting the foregoing, may with the consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) pursue or forego any and
all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in its reasonable discretion,
either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits
such refund suits or contest the Tax Proceeding in any permissible manner.
The Seller shall be entitled to participate in all proceedings with respect
to any such Tax Proceeding (at its expense) and to employ counsel of its
choice for such purpose.   (d) The Seller and the Buyer shall each provide
the other (and, in the case of the Buyer, shall cause the Company or Company
Subsidiaries, as appropriate, to provide the Seller) with copies of all
material documents with respect to the aforementioned Tax Proceedings.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer and the Seller shall jointly control
all proceedings taken in connection with (i) any Tax Proceeding relating
solely to Taxes for a Straddle Period and (ii) any Tax Proceeding which might
result in both an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 8.1(a) and an
indemnity payment pursuant to Section 8.1(b). In no case shall any party
settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Proceeding without the other party\'s
prior written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld).  
(e) The Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
the Seller, on the other hand, shall cooperate with each other in contesting
any Tax Proceeding, which cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other party\'s request) the provision of records and information which
are reasonably relevant to such Tax Proceeding, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify
at proceedings relating to such Tax Proceeding and, in the case of the Buyer,
causing the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to so cooperate.   SECTION
8.3. Adjustment to Purchase Price. The parties agree to treat all payments
made under this Article VIII and under any other indemnity provisions
contained in this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.   SECTION 8.4. Filing of Tax
Returns.   (a) Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. The
Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and the Buyer shall timely file
or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns (including all amended Tax
Returns) that are required to be filed for or with respect to the Company and
each Company Subsidiary for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date other than income Tax
Returns with respect to periods for which a consolidated, unitary or combined
income Tax Return of the Seller will    -46-    include the operations
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice, except to the extent
required by GAAP or applicable Law. The Seller will allow the Buyer an
opportunity to review and comment upon any such Tax Returns (including any
amended returns). The Seller shall reimburse within fifteen days after
payment by Buyer or the Company or the Company Subsidiaries of such Taxes.
Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice
except to the extent required by GAAP or applicable Law.   (b) Returns for
Periods through the Closing Date. The Seller will include the income of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including any deferred income triggered
into income by Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-13 and ss. 1.1502-14 and any
income, gain, loss, deduction or other tax item resulting from the Elections
(as described in Section 8.9(a)) on the Seller\'s consolidated unitary,
combined or other income Tax Returns for all periods through the Closing Date
and pay any income tax attributable to such income. The Buyer shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to furnish Tax information to the Seller
for inclusion in the Seller\'s consolidated unitary, combined or other income
Tax Return for the period which includes the Closing Date in accordance with
the past custom and practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The
Seller will allow the Buyer an opportunity to review and comment upon such
Tax Returns (including any amended returns) to the extent that they relate to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The Seller will take no position on
such returns that relate to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that is
inconsistent with prior practice and that would adversely affect the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. The income of the
Company and the Subsidiaries will be apportioned to the period up to and
including the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by closing
the books of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the end of the
Closing Date.   (c) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed any Tax Returns for or with respect to the Company and each
Company Subsidiary that are required to be filed for Taxable Periods which
are Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with prior practice except to the extent required by GAAP or by
applicable Law. The Buyer will allow the Seller an opportunity to review and
comment upon any such Straddle Period Tax Return (including any amended
return). If the Seller objects to the treatment of any item on any such Tax
Return or to any amount owed to or by the Seller with respect to any Straddle
Period Taxes, the Seller shall, as promptly as practicable, notify the Buyer
in writing that it so objects, specifying with particularity any such item
and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a
notice of objection shall be duly delivered, the Seller and the Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreement. If the Seller and the
Buyer have not resolved their disagreement within five Business Days after
receipt by Buyer of such notice, they shall refer the matter for resolution
to a mutually acceptable nationally recognized independent accounting firm,
the decision of which shall be binding on the Seller and the Buyer. The
costs, fees and expenses of the accounting firm shall be borne by (i) the
Seller if the net resolution of the disputed items favors the Buyer, (ii) the
Buyer if the net resolution of the disputed items favors the Seller and (iii)
otherwise equally by the Buyer and the Seller. The Seller shall pay to the
Buyer within 15 days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to
such periods an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period, including    -47-    any income or gain
resulting from the Elections; provided, however, that if the Seller has
delivered a notice of objection in respect of any item on the Tax Return or
to any amount owed to or by the Seller with respect to any Straddle Period
Taxes, and such disagreement is not resolved prior to the filing of the Tax
Return, the Seller shall not be required to pay any amount to the Buyer in
respect of such disputed item until the dispute has been resolved either by
agreement of the parties or by the above-described independent accounting
firm. For purposes of this Section 8.4(c), the portion of any such Tax that
relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined as prescribed in
Section 8.1(d).   SECTION 8.5. Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Seller, the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
auditors and other representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns, including providing powers of attorney, maintaining
and making available to each other all records necessary in connection with
Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable
periods relating to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Buyer and the Seller agree to retain (and, in the case of the
Buyer, to cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to retain) all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by the Buyer or the Seller, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods.   SECTION 8.6. Certain Taxes and Fees. All
transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and other such Taxes
(including all applicable real estate transfer or gains Taxes) and related
fees (including any penalties, interest and additions to Tax) incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be
paid by the Seller when due, and the Seller will, at its own expense, file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by applicable law, the Buyer will,
and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.   SECTION 8.7. Carrybacks. The Seller will
immediately pay to the Buyer the value of any Tax refund (or reduction in Tax
liability) resulting from a carryback of a post-acquisition Tax attribute of
any of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries into the Seller\'s combined or
unitary Tax Return, when such refund or reduction is realized by the
Seller\'s group. The Seller will cooperate with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in obtaining such refunds (or reduction in Tax liability),
including through the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims. The
Buyer agrees to indemnify the Seller for any Taxes resulting from the
disallowance of such post-acquisition Tax attribute on audit or otherwise. In
computing the value of any Tax refund (or reduction in Tax liability)
resulting from a carryback of a post-acquisition Tax attribute of any of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, the Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to recognize all other items of gross income, gain, loss, deduction
and credit before recognizing any post-acquisition Tax attribute carried
back. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall use its best efforts to
waive all carryback periods.    -48-     SECTION 8.8. Refunds and
Credits. Any Tax refund and any amounts credited against Tax that are
actually realized by or with respect to the Company or a Company Subsidiary
that relate to Tax periods prior to Closing shall be for the account of the
Seller, and the Buyer shall pay over to the Seller the net amount of any such
refund or credit within thirty days after receipt of such refund or
utilization of such credit.   SECTION 8.9. Allocation of Purchase Price;
Section 338(h)(10) Elections.   (a) With respect to the Seller\'s sale of
the Interests to the Buyer and, indirectly, the sale of all of the
outstanding equity interests (the "Shares") of each of the Company
Subsidiaries to the Buyer, the Seller and the Buyer shall jointly make in
respect of each Company Subsidiary a timely and irrevocable election under
section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding election under state
and local Tax law) (collectively, the "Elections"). The Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with the Buyer to take all actions necessary and
appropriate (including, timely preparing and filing such additional forms,
Tax Returns, elections, schedules and other documents separately or jointly
with the Buyer) as may be required to effect and preserve timely Elections in
accordance with section 338(h)(10) of the Code, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, and any corresponding provisions of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. The Seller, the Buyer, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall report the purchase by the Buyer of the Shares in a manner
consistent with the Elections and shall take no position
inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return or Tax audit or otherwise.   (b)
To the extent possible, the Buyer, the Seller, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall execute at the Closing any and all forms necessary to
effectuate the Elections (including IRS Form 8023 and, as applicable,

to the purchase and sale of the Shares. In the event, however, any such form
or forms are not executed at the Closing, the Buyer, the Seller, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall prepare and complete each such form no
later than 15 days prior to the date such form is required to be filed. The
Buyer, the Seller, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall each cause
the forms to be duly executed by an authorized person for the Buyer, the
Seller, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in each case, and shall duly
and timely file the forms in accordance with applicable tax laws and the
terms of this Agreement.   (c) As soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, the Seller and the Buyer shall agree upon (i) the allocation of the
Purchase Price among the assets of the Company (the "Purchase Price
Allocation") and (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each Company
Subsidiary and the allocation of the deemed sales price of the assets of each
such Company Subsidiary resulting from the Elections (as required pursuant to
section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and
any comparable provisions of state or local law, as appropriate) among such
assets (the "Section 338 Allocation" and, collectively with the Purchase
Price Allocation, the "Allocations"). Such Allocations shall be set forth on
a schedule to be prepared jointly by the Buyer and the Seller within 135 days
of the Closing. If during such period the Buyer and the Seller cannot agree
on such Allocations, such dispute shall be submitted to a mutually acceptable
nationally recognized accounting firm. If an Allocation is submitted to such
accounting firm, it shall be adjusted to reflect all agreed upon changes and
the resolution of    -49-    all disputed items by the accounting firm
(such allocation as adjusted either as a result of negotiation between the
parties or as a result of the accounting firm\'s decision). The Buyer, the
Seller and the Company Subsidiaries (A) shall be bound by, (B) shall file all
Tax Returns on a basis consistent with, and (C) shall take no position in any
Tax Return or Tax audit or otherwise which is inconsistent with the
Allocations.   SECTION 8.10. Tax Sharing Agreements. Any tax sharing

past year).   ARTICLE IX  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CONSUMMATION OF THE

rise to a claim hereunder and the representation and warranties contained in
Section 3.1 (Organization of Seller; Ownership of the Interests), Section 5.1
(Organization; Capitalization of the Company) and Section 5.3 (Subsidiaries)
shall survive indefinitely. In order to seek a remedy pursuant to this

Subject to the provisions of Article VIII and the limitations set forth in
Section 10.1 and Section 10.4, the Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
the Buyer and its directors, officers, employees, stockholders and Affiliates
(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any
and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Party (any
of such Losses by Buyer Indemnified Parties, a "Buyer Claim") as a result of
or in connection with any of the following:   (i) any inaccuracy or breach
of a representation or warranty as  of the date hereof or as of the Closing
Date (except with respect to  Section 5.17 which is provided for pursuant to
Section 8.1(a)) made  by the Seller in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered  pursuant hereto; provided, however, that for purposes of this 
provision, with respect to any representation or warranty that is  qualified
by materiality, Material Adverse Effect or knowledge, a  breach of such
representation   -53-     or warranty shall be deemed to occur if there
would have been a  breach of such representation or warranty absent such
qualification;   (ii) the breach, or default in the performance by the
Seller,  of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by the 
Seller pursuant to this Agreement or the Transition Services  Agreement;  
(iii) any Losses resulting from any third party claims or  Actions or any
other conditions (including, but not limited to,  taxes, environmental
conditions, litigation, product and service  warranty and liability matters
and employment-related matters) to  the extent such Losses relate to an act,
event or condition  occurring or existing at or prior to the Closing Date;
provided,  however, that any Liability that is covered by the Purchase
Price  adjustment provisions of Section 2.5 shall not give rise to any 
indemnification obligation under this Section 10.2(a)(iii) to the  extent
such Liability is covered by the adjustment provisions of  Section 2.5;
provided, further, that indemnification rights under  this Section
10.2(a)(iii) shall survive the Closing for a period of  two years beginning
on the Closing Date, but not longer, except with  respect to indemnification
rights for any third party claims or  Actions or environmental conditions
which shall survive  indefinitely;   (iv) any Losses resulting from
violations of plumbing licensing  requirements;   (v) (A) any Losses in
connection with any Company Plan that is  not a Transferred Company Plan, (B)
any Losses in connection with a  Transferred Company Plan to the extent such
Losses arise from an  act, event or condition occurring or existing at or
prior to the  Closing Date, except for employment agreements with respect to
which  Losses arise from an act, event or condition occurring after the 
Closing Date (C) any Losses resulting from the failure to file GUST 
amendments that were required to be filed on or before February 28,  2002 and
(D) any Losses resulting from the participation in  employment benefit plans
pursuant to a collective bargaining  agreement or any other agreement with
any labor union or association  by employees who are not members of any labor
union, association or  other representative of employees during periods at or
prior to the  Closing Date;   (vi) any Losses (A) resulting from third
party claims or  Actions that would have been covered by any type of
insurance to the  extent such claim or Action is not covered as a result of
denials of  coverage or inadequate insurance coverage, (B) resulting from 
deductibles, retrospectively rated insurance policies, self-insured 
retentions, risk-retention groups or other similar arrangements or  (C)
resulting from claims incurred on or prior to the Closing Date  (whether or
not reported) by Company Employees and not paid on or  prior to the Closing
Date with respect to any life insurance,  health, medical, dental, disability
or other similar welfare plan,  agreement, program, policy or other
arrangement;    -54-     (vii) any Losses resulting from the failure to
hold a  sufficient, valid and enforceable license to use any Intellectual 
Property used in the business of any Company Subsidiary as currently 
conducted or that has been used in such business at any time prior  to the
Closing, including but not limited to any remediation costs,  which, to the
extent that is commercially reasonable, shall be the  cost of obtaining a
license of the currently available version of  such Intellectual Property;
and   (viii) any Losses relating to the failure to collect in the 
aggregate the full amount of the Receivables outstanding as of the  Closing
Date (other than the Scheduled Amounts) (net of the  allowance for doubtful
accounts set forth on the Most Recent Balance  Sheet) within 14 months after
the Closing Date (provided that each  Company Subsidiary has used its
commercially reasonable efforts to  collect such Receivables).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the first  parenthetical to this subparagraph
(viii) shall not apply to any  amount set forth on Schedule 5.19(a) to the
extent (A) such amount  has been included as accounts receivable in the
calculation of  assets for determining Closing Net Asset Value and (B) there
has not  been included as billings in excess of costs in respect of such 
amount an equal or greater number in the calculation of liabilities  for
determining Closing Net Asset Value.   (b) Promptly after receipt by a Buyer
Indemnified Party of  notice of the commencement of an Action or other event
giving rise  to a Buyer Claim with respect to which such Buyer Indemnified
Party  is entitled to indemnification under this Section 10.2, such Buyer 
Indemnified Party shall notify (the "Buyer Claim Notice") the Seller  in
writing of the commencement of such Action or the assertion of  such Buyer
Claim; provided, however, that if such Buyer Claim Notice  is given within
the period prescribed in Section 10.1, then the  failure to give such Buyer
Claim Notice promptly shall not affect  the right to indemnification
hereunder except to the extent of  actual prejudice to the Seller. The Seller
shall have the option,  and shall notify such Buyer Indemnified Party in
writing within 20  Business Days after the date of the Buyer Claim Notice of
its  election, either (i) to participate (at the expense of the Seller)  in
the defense of such Action or Buyer Claim (in which case the  defense of such
Action or Buyer Claim shall be controlled by such  Buyer Indemnified Party)
or (ii) to take charge of and control the  defense of such Action or Buyer
Claim (at the expense of the Seller)  with counsel reasonably acceptable to
such Buyer Indemnified Party;  provided, however, that the Seller shall not
be entitled to control  any Buyer Claim already covered by insurance or
relating to  construction, warranty or service disputes, except for a
contractual  dispute with a customer with whom a Company Subsidiary does not
have  a material ongoing relationship. Any such construction, warranty or 
service disputes shall be handled by the Buyer and its counsel at  the
expense of the Seller; provided, however, that the Buyer and its  counsel
shall act in a manner consistent with a duty to protect the  Seller\'s
interests as if they were the Buyer\'s own interests and  shall keep the
Seller reasonably informed of the status of any such  disputes. If the Seller
fails to notify such Buyer Indemnified Party  of its election within the
applicable response period, then the  Seller shall be deemed to have elected
not to control the defense of  such Action or Buyer Claim. If the Seller
elects to assume the  defense of such Action or Buyer Claim, the Buyer
Indemnified Party  shall have the right to employ separate counsel and
participate in  the defense of such Action or Buyer Claim, but the fees and
expenses  of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Buyer   
-55-     Indemnified Party unless (A) the named parties in such Action
or  Buyer Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both such  Buyer
Indemnified Party and the Seller, and such Buyer Indemnified  Party shall
have been reasonably advised by such counsel that there  may be one or more
legal defenses available to it that are different  from or additional to
those available to the Seller, (B) such Buyer  Indemnified Party has been
reasonably advised by counsel that  representation by the Seller is
inappropriate in light of an actual  or potential conflict of interest
between them, or (C) such Buyer  Indemnified Party has reasonably determined
that Losses that may be  incurred may exceed either individually, or when
aggregated with  other Buyer Claims, the Maximum Indemnity Amount (in which
case, the  Seller shall not have the right to control the defense of such 
Action or Buyer Claim on behalf of such Buyer Indemnified Party, it  being
understood, however, that the Seller shall not, in connection  with such
Action or Buyer Claim, be liable for the fees and expenses  of more than one
such separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any  local counsel) and that
all such fees and expenses shall be  reimbursed as they are incurred).  
(c) If the Seller does not control the defense of any Action or Buyer Claim,
then the Buyer Indemnified Party may settle such Action or Buyer Claim only
with the written consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If the Seller elects to control the defense of any Action or Buyer
Claim, then it will not consent to the entry of judgment or compromise or
settle such Action or Buyer Claim without the consent of the Buyer
Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   SECTION
10.3. Indemnification by Buyer.   (a) Subject to the limitations set forth
in Sections 10.1 and 10.4, the Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the
Seller and its directors, officers, employees, stockholders and Affiliates
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against
any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties
(any of such Losses by Seller Indemnified Parties, a "Seller Claim") as a
result of or in connection with any of the following:   (i) any inaccuracy
or breach of a representation or warranty as  of the date hereof or as of the
Closing Date made by the Buyer in  this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant hereto;  provided that for purposes of this provision,
with respect to any  representation or warranty that is qualified by
materiality,  Material Adverse Effect or knowledge, a breach of such 
representation or warranty shall be deemed to occur if there would  have been
a breach of such representation or warranty absent such  qualification;
and   (ii) the breach of, or default in the performance by the Buyer,  of
any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by the  Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement or the Transition Services  Agreement;   (iii) any Losses
resulting from the Seller\'s obligations to  indemnify any surety company in
respect of claims made by reason of  the acts or omissions of a Company
Subsidiary to the extent such act  or omission solely relates to an act,
event or condition occurring  after the Closing Date; and    -56-    
(iv) the guarantees of the Seller listed on Schedule  10.3(a)(iv) to the
extent each such Loss relates to an act, event or  condition occurring after
the Closing Date.   (b) Promptly after receipt by a Seller Indemnified Party
of notice of the commencement of an Action or other event giving rise to a
Seller Claim with respect to which the Seller Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification under this Section 10.3, such Seller Indemnified
Party receiving such notice shall notify (the "Seller Claim Notice") the
Buyer in writing of the commencement of such Action or the assertion of such
Seller Claim; provided, however, that if such Seller Claim Notice is given
within the period prescribed in Section 10.1, then the failure to give such
Seller Claim Notice promptly shall not affect the right to indemnification
hereunder except to the extent of actual prejudice to the Buyer. The Buyer
shall have the option, and shall notify such Seller Indemnified Party in
writing within 20 Business Days after the date of the Seller Claim Notice of
its election, either (i) to participate (at the expense of the Buyer) in the
defense of the Action or Seller Claim (in which case the defense of such
Action or Seller Claim shall be controlled by such Seller Indemnified Party)
or (ii) to take charge of and control defense of such Action or Seller Claim
(at the expense of the Buyer) with counsel reasonably acceptable to such
Seller Indemnified Party. If the Buyer fails to notify such Seller
Indemnified Party of its election within the applicable response period, then
the Buyer shall be deemed to have elected not to control the defense of such
Action or Seller Claim. If the Buyer elects to assume the defense of such
Action or Seller Claim, such Seller Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel and participate in the defense of any such Action or
Seller Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such Seller Indemnified Party unless (A) the named parties in such
Action or Seller Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both such
Seller Indemnified Party and the Buyer, and such Seller Indemnified Party
shall have been reasonably advised by such counsel that there may be one or
more legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to
those available to the Buyer, (B) the Seller Indemnified Party has been
reasonably advised by counsel that representation by the Buyer is
inappropriate in light of an actual or potential conflict of interest between
them, or (C) such Seller Indemnified Party has reasonably determined that
Losses that may be incurred may exceed either individually, or when
aggregated with other Seller Claims, the Maximum Indemnity Amount (in which
case, the Buyer shall not have the right to assume the defense of such Action
or Seller Claim on behalf of such Seller Indemnified Party, it being
understood, however, that the Buyer shall not, in connection with such Action
or Seller Claim be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one such
separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) and that such
fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred).   (c) If the
Buyer does not control the defense of any Action or Seller Claim, then the
Seller Indemnified Party may settle such Action or Seller Claim only with the
written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the
Buyer elects to control the defense of any Action or Seller Claim, then it
will not consent to the entry of judgment or compromise or settle such Action
or Seller Claim without the consent of the Seller Indemnified Party (not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   SECTION 10.4. Limitation of
Liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Seller shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section    -57-    10.2(a)(i) or 10.2(a)(iii), and Buyer shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section
10.3(a)(i), in each case, unless and until (i) except as otherwise set forth
in clause (ii) below, the amount of all Losses incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, or by the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may
be, exceeds $1,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Basket"), in which event the
party seeking indemnity may recover all Losses incurred in excess of the
Basket from the first dollar above the Basket, and (ii) with respect only to
Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with a breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.19(a) or the
related indemnification set forth in Section 10.3(a)(viii), the amount of
such Losses exceeds $1,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Receivables Basket"),
such Receivables Basket not to be aggregated with the Basket, in which event
the Buyer Indemnified Party may recover all Losses incurred in excess of the
Receivables Basket from the first dollar above the Receivables Basket,
subject to Section 10.5, and the Seller acknowledges and agrees that any
accounts receivable not collected within 14 months of its creation shall be
deemed "uncollectible" for purposes of the indemnification provisions of this
Agreement; and (b) the Seller\'s maximum liability for Losses under Sections
10.2(a)(i) and 10.2(a)(iii) and Buyer\'s maximum liability for Losses under
Section 10.3(a)(i) shall be, in each case, an amount equal to the Purchase
Price (the "Maximum Indemnity Amount"). The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that this Section 10.4 shall not apply to indemnification obligations
of the Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(a), 10.2(a)(ii), 10.2(a)(iv),
10.2(a)(v), 10.2(a)(vi) or 10(a)(vii) hereof, or the indemnification
obligations of the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(b), 10.3(a)(ii),
10.3(a)(iii) or 10.3(a)(iv), each of which shall be without deduction or
limitation.   SECTION 10.5. Certain Indemnification Matters With Respect
to Receivables.   (a) The Buyer agrees to provide updates for the periods
ended September 30, 2002 and April 30, 2003, within 45 days after each such
period, as to (i) the aggregate amount of the Receivables which have not
been collected, (ii) the status of each unpaid Receivable in excess of
$50,000 and (iii) to the Buyer\'s best knowledge, the creditworthiness of any
account debtor owing any such unpaid Receivable in excess of $50,000;
provided, however, that any failure by the Buyer to deliver such updates in a
timely manner shall not affect the Buyer\'s right to indemnification for
Receivables under this Article X except to the extent of actual prejudice to
the Seller.   (b) With respect to the indemnification provisions of
Section 10.2(a)(viii) and Section 10.4(a)(ii), the parties agree as
follows:   (i) to the extent a Buyer Indemnified Party collects
Receivables  that had been written off by the Seller prior to the Closing
Date, such  Buyer Indemnified Party shall credit such Receivables against
any  indemnification amounts owed by the Seller to the Buyer Indemnified 
Parties;   (ii) to the extent a Buyer Indemnified Party receives payment
in  respect of indemnification for Receivables, such Buyer Indemnified
Party  shall assign to the Seller all rights to such Receivables, as well as
any  associated liens; and    -58-     (iii) to the extent a Buyer
Indemnified Party collects Receivables  for which the Seller has previously
indemnified such Buyer Indemnified  Party, such Buyer Indemnified Party shall
remit such proceeds to the  Seller.   SECTION 10.6. Exclusive Remedy. After
the Closing, the parties\' sole and exclusive recourse against each other for
any Loss or claim of Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement, except for any claim
of fraud, shall be expressly limited to the provisions of this Article X and
Sections 8.1(a) and 8.1(b). The Seller shall not have any right of
contribution from the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any
Loss claimed by the Buyer. The Seller hereby agrees that it will not make any
claim for indemnification against any of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries by reason of the fact that it was a director, officer, employee,
or agent of any such entity or was serving at the request of any such entity
as a partner, trustee, director, officer, employee, or agent of another
entity (whether such claim is for judgments, damages, penalties, fines,
costs, amounts paid in settlement, losses, expenses, or otherwise and whether
such claim is pursuant to any statute, charter document, bylaw, agreement, or
otherwise) with respect to any action, suit, proceeding, complaint, claim, or
demand brought by the Buyer against the Seller (whether such action, suit,
proceeding, complaint, claim, or demand is pursuant to this Agreement,
applicable law, or otherwise).   ARTICLE XI  TERMINATION   SECTION 11.1.
Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time, prior to the
Closing, only as follows:   (a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and
the Seller at any time prior to the Closing;   (b) by the Buyer, upon
written notice to the Seller at any time prior to the Closing, in the event
that the Seller has breached any representation, warranty, or covenant
contained in this Agreement that would cause the provisions of Section 9.2
not to be satisfied, the Buyer has notified the Seller of the breach, and the
breach has continued without cure for a period of 30 days after the notice of
breach;   (c) by the Seller, upon written notice to the Buyer at any
time prior to the Closing, in the event that the Buyer has breached
any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement that

covenant.   SECTION 12.10. Severability. Any term or provision of this
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining

jurisdiction.   SECTION 12.11. No Third Parties; No Reliance. Except as
specifically set forth or referred to herein, nothing herein expressed or

ESCROW AGREEMENT   This Escrow Agreement, dated as of March [__], 2002
(this "Agreement"), is made and entered into by and among Comfort Systems
USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Seller"), EMCOR-CSI Holding Co., a
Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), and Bank One, National Association, as escrow
agent (the "Agent").   WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, the Seller and the Buyer
are parties to a Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 11, 2002 (the
"Purchase Agreement"); and   WHEREAS, pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.6 of
the Purchase Agreement, the Buyer and the Seller have agreed to deposit
$2,500,000 (together with all interest and profits thereon and proceeds
therefrom, the "Adjustment Escrow Amount") in an escrow account to be held in
escrow during the period commencing on the Closing Date (as defined below)
and expiring on the date on which payment of the Adjustment Amount (as
defined below) is made in accordance with Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of the
Purchase Agreement (such period, the "Adjustment Security Period"); and  
WHEREAS, pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.6 of the Purchase Agreement, the
Buyer and the Seller have agreed to deposit $5,000,000 (together with
all interest and profits thereon and proceeds therefrom, the
"Indemnification Escrow Amount") in an escrow account to be held in escrow
during the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring 18 months after
the Closing Date (such period, the "Indemnification Security Period");
and   WHEREAS, the Agent is willing to act as escrow agent hereunder;  
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   1. Definitions. Capitalized
terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the
Purchase Agreement.   2. Appointment of Agent. The Agent is hereby appointed
by each of the Seller and the Buyer to act as escrow agent hereunder. The
Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to hold and administer the
Escrow Account (as defined below) in accordance with the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein.   3. Establishment of the Escrow Account.
On the Closing Date, the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnification
Escrow Amount (collectively, the "Escrow Funds") shall be deposited with the
Agent in a separate escrow account (the "Escrow Account") as set forth in the
Purchase Agreement. The parties hereto agree that the Agent is serving solely
as escrow agent and does not, and will not, own or have any interest in the
Escrow Funds, having     only possession of the Escrow Funds. The parties
hereto intend that the Escrow Account be treated for tax purposes as a
grantor trust to which the [Seller/Buyer] has transferred the Escrow Funds.
Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that for tax purposes they will treat
the [Seller/Buyer] as the owner of the Escrow Funds.   4. Investment of
Escrow Funds. During the term of this Agreement, all or any portion of the
Escrow Funds shall be invested and reinvested by the Agent, as directed in
writing by the [Seller/Buyer], in (a) obligations that (i) are issued by the
United States government or any agency or instrumentality thereof and (ii)
have a maturity of not more than three months; (b) obligations that (i) are
issued by any state or municipality of the United States, (ii) have a
maturity of not more than three months and (iii) have one of the two highest
rating grades by Moody\'s Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody\'s") or Standard and
Poor\'s, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("SandP;"), (c)
certificates of deposit that (i) are issued by any bank or trust company that
has (A) debt obligation ratings in one of the two highest rating grades by
Moody\'s or SandP; and (B) a combined capital and surplus and undivided profits
of not less than $100,000,000 and (ii) have a maturity of not more than three
months; or (d) money market rate accounts with the Agent. The Agent shall
liquidate all or any portion of the investments made with the Escrow Funds at
such time and in such manner as the [Seller/Buyer] may direct in writing or,
in the absence of any such direction, as the Agent, in its sole and absolute
discretion, may elect, in each case in order to convert such investments into
cash for application and distribution in accordance with this Agreement.  
5. Duration; Release of Escrow.   (a) Release of Adjustment Escrow
Amount   (i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii) of this  Section
5(a), the Agent shall hold the Adjustment Escrow Amount  until the
termination of the Adjustment Security Period.   (ii) If the Agent shall be
furnished with a copy of a  determination pursuant to Section 2.5(d) of the
Purchase Agreement  (a "Determination") stating that the Independent
Accountants have  determined that (A) the Buyer\'s calculation of the Closing
Net Asset  Value or the Seller\'s calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value,
as  the case may be, more closely approximates the Net Asset Value as of 
the Closing Date and (B) such closer approximation of the Net Asset  Value as
of the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the Closing Net  Asset Value for
all purposes of the Purchase Agreement, shall be  final, binding and
conclusive on the Seller and the Buyer and shall  be used in computing the
Adjustment Amount, then the Agent shall  subtract such Closing Net Asset
Value from [$65,900,000](1) to  determine the Adjustment Amount. If the
Adjustment Amount is  positive, then the Agent shall promptly, but in no
event more than  five Business Days after receipt by the Agent of the
Determination,  reduce the Adjustment Escrow Amount by an amount equal to the
lesser  of (1) the Adjustment Amount, together  _______________  (1) This
number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 11.1(f) of the Purchase  Agreement
prior to execution of this Escrow Agreement.    2    with interest
thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from the Closing  Date until the date on
which the Adjustment Amount is paid, and (2)  the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
and pay such amount by wire transfer  of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing  by the Buyer. If the Adjustment Amount is
negative, then the Agent  shall promptly, but in no event more than five
Business Days after  receipt by the Agent of the Determination, release to
the Seller the  Adjustment Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately
available  funds to an account designated in writing by the Seller.   (iii)
If the Agent receives a notice of agreement ("Notice of  Agreement") that is
executed by the Buyer and the Seller with  respect to the Adjustment Amount
and directing the Agent to pay an  amount stated therein to the Buyer or the
Seller, as specified  therein, then the Agent shall promptly, but in no event
more than  five Business Days after receipt by the Agent of such Notice of 
Agreement, reduce the Adjustment Escrow Amount by an amount equal to  the
lesser of (A) the amount stated in such Notice of Agreement and  (B) the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, and pay such amount by wire  transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in  writing by the Buyer
or the Seller, as the case may be.   (iv) At the end of the Adjustment
Security Period, the Agent  shall release to the Seller any remaining
Adjustment Escrow Amount  by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account  designated in writing by the Seller.   (b) Release of
Indemnification Escrow Amount   (i) Except as provided in clauses (ii)
through (iv) of this  Section 5(b), the Agent shall hold the Indemnification
Escrow Amount  until the termination of the Indemnification Security
Period.   (ii) If the Agent shall be furnished by the Buyer with a copy  of
an award (an "Award") in an action against the Seller by the  Buyer made by
any arbitrator, mediator or court of competent  jurisdiction resulting from a
claim for indemnification by the Buyer  pursuant to Article X of the Purchase
Agreement, then the Agent  shall promptly, but in no event more than five
Business Days after  receipt by the Agent of such Award, reduce the
Indemnification  Escrow Amount by an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the
amount  stated in the Award and (B) the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and 
pay such amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to  an
account designated in writing by the Buyer.   (iii) If the Agent receives a
Notice of Agreement that is  executed by the Buyer and the Seller with
respect to the payment of  a claim for indemnification by the Buyer pursuant
to Article X of  the Purchase Agreement, then the Agent shall promptly, but
in no  event more than five Business Days after receipt by the Agent of 
such Notice of Agreement, reduce the Indemnification Escrow Amount  by an
amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount stated in such  Notice of
Agreement and (B) the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and  pay such amount by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to  an account designated in
writing by the Buyer.   3    (iv) At the end of the Indemnification
Security Period, the  Agent shall release to the Seller any remaining
Indemnification  Escrow Amount that is not necessary to satisfy any amounts
with  respect to any unresolved claim for indemnification under Article X 
of the Purchase Agreement made by the Buyer prior to the end of the 
Indemnification Security Period.   (c) The Agent shall distribute any assets
held by it pursuant to this Agreement in such manner and at such time or

in the Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Seller.   6. Limitation of Agent\'s
Duties and Liability.   (a) The duties and responsibilities of the Agent
hereunder shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
Agreement, and no other or further duties or responsibilities shall be
implied.   (b) The Agent may rely and shall be protected in acting
or refraining from acting upon any written notice, instruction or
request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Agent shall
be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or
content of any document. The Agent shall have no duty to solicit any item

Agent may consult with counsel of its own choice and shall have full and
complete authorization and protection for any action taken or omitted by it
hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the opinion or advice of such
counsel.   (d) The Buyer and the Seller hereby jointly and severally agree
to indemnify the Agent for and to hold it harmless against any loss,
liability or expense arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and
the carrying out its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of
defending itself against any claim of liability, except in those cases where
the Agent has been guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Anything

uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or receives instructions,
claims or demands from any party hereto that, in its opinion, conflict with
any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from
taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all

instrument so delivered, or for any representations made or obligations

cause to be provided, to Buyer for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
the services described on Schedule 2.1(A) hereto and Schedule 2.1(B) hereto
(individually or in the aggregate, the "Seller Provided Services").   2.2
Buyer Provided Services. Pursuant to the terms of this Services Agreement,
Buyer will provide, or cause to be provided, to Seller the services described
on Schedule 2.2 hereto (individually or in the aggregate, the "Buyer Provided
Services").   2.3 Other Services. If, after the execution of this
Services Agreement, (a) the parties determine that (i) a service provided by
Seller to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) a service provided by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to Seller, in each case in accordance
with the practice of Seller, the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as
applicable, prior to the Closing, was inadvertently omitted from the
Schedules hereto, and (b) Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, desires to
temporarily continue receiving such service, then the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to attempt to agree to the terms and conditions upon which such
service shall be added to this Services Agreement, it being agreed that the
charges for such service should be determined on a basis consistent with the
methodology for determining the initial compensation for the Services
described on the Schedules hereto.   ARTICLE 3   COMPENSATION   3.1
Compensation for Services. Subject to Section 3.3, the compensation for any
Service for the duration of the Term shall be as specified on the Schedules
hereto.    2    3.2 Cost of Consents. Unless otherwise specified on the
Schedules hereto, in the case of software applications and other intellectual
property that are provided by Seller to, are owned by, or are licensed to,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary,   (a) Seller shall bear all costs
and expenses of obtaining any and all consents, waivers and licenses which
may be necessary in connection with Seller\'s providing software Services to
Buyer for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; and   (b) Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate in good faith to minimize the costs and expenses to be
incurred by Seller pursuant to this Section 3.2.   3.3 Terms of Payment;
Dispute Resolution.   (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or
on the Schedules hereto, each Provider shall invoice the applicable Recipient
monthly (or, if mutually agreeable to such Provider and such Recipient,
quarterly or semi-annually) for the Services provided by such Provider under
this Services Agreement. Payment in United States dollars shall be made by
the applicable Recipient within 15 days after receipt of invoice. No
Recipient shall withhold or set-off any payments to any Provider under this
Services Agreement, and no Provider shall withhold the provision of any
Services to any Recipient, notwithstanding any dispute that may be pending
between them, whether under this Services Agreement or otherwise (any
required adjustment being made on subsequent invoices), unless such
withholding is provided for in a judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with Section 7.7.   (b) If there is a dispute
between any Recipient and any Provider regarding the amounts shown as billed
to such Recipient on any invoice from such Provider, such Provider shall
furnish to such Recipient reasonable documentation to substantiate the
amounts so billed including, but not limited to, listings of the dates, times
and amounts of the Services in question, if applicable and practicable. Upon
delivery of such documentation, such Recipient and such Provider shall
cooperate and each use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute
between themselves. If (i) such Recipient and such Provider are unable to
resolve their dispute within 30 calendar days of the initiation of such
procedure, (ii) such Recipient believes in good faith and with a reasonable
basis that the amounts shown as billed to such Recipient are inaccurate or
are otherwise not in accordance with the terms of this Services Agreement and
(iii) such Recipient has previously paid such invoice in accordance with
Section 3.3(a), then such Recipient shall have the right, at its own expense,
to commence litigation in accordance with Section 7.7.   ARTICLE 4  
TERM   4.1 Term. Except as expressly otherwise provided in this
Services Agreement, (a) the term with respect to any particular individual
Service shall be as indicated on the applicable Schedule hereto and (b) the
term of this Services Agreement (the "Term") shall end on the date on which
the respective separate terms for all Services as indicated on the
Schedules hereto shall have expired. The obligation of any Recipient to make
a payment for Services previously    3   rendered shall not be affected
by the expiration of the Term and shall continue until full payment is
made.   4.2 Termination of Individual Services. Each individual Service
has a separate term as provided in Schedule 2.1(A), Schedule 2.1(B) or
Schedule 2.2, as applicable, which term may, in the case of Services listed
on Schedule 2.1(A) and Schedule 2.2, include a right of extension as
described in such Schedule. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to the
immediately succeeding sentence, the obligation of a Provider to provide any
applicable Service will terminate upon the expiration of the separate term
for such Service as provided in the applicable Schedule. At any time during
the Term, a Recipient may terminate any individual Service provided to such
Recipient under this Services Agreement on a Service-by-Service basis (and/or
a location-by-location basis, where an individual Service is provided
to multiple locations of a Recipient) upon written notice to the
Provider identifying (a) the particular Service (or location) to be
terminated and (b) the effective date of termination, which date shall not be
less than three Business Days after receipt of such notice unless the
applicable Provider otherwise agrees.   ARTICLE 5   CERTAIN COVENANTS  
5.1 Points of Contact. Each Provider and Recipient shall name a point of
contact, which shall be added to the Schedules hereto, and which may be
amended from time to time upon prior written notice to the other party. Such
points of contact shall be responsible for the implementation of
this Services Agreement between such Provider and such Recipient,
including resolution of any issues that may arise during the performance of
such Provider and such Recipient hereunder on a day-to-day basis. Issues
that cannot be resolved by the respective points of contact will be
escalated through the respective parties\' management.   5.2 Cooperation;
Reasonable Care.   (a) The parties will cooperate (using reasonable best
efforts) to effect a smooth and orderly transition of each Service provided
hereunder from the applicable Provider to the applicable Recipient; provided,
however, that this Section 5.2 shall not require any party hereto to incur
any out-of-pocket expenses unless and except as expressly otherwise provided
herein. The parties will cooperate in good faith toward completing the
transition of the Services provided hereunder prior to the expiration of
their respective terms.   (b) Each Provider shall (i) perform the Services
that it is required to provide to the applicable Recipient under this
Services Agreement with reasonable skill and care and (ii) use at least that
degree of skill and care that it would exercise in similar circumstances in
carrying out its own business. Each Provider shall take necessary measures to
protect the applicable Recipient\'s data that is processed by such Provider
from destruction, deletion or unauthorized change; provided, however, that
a Provider shall be deemed to have satisfied this obligation if the
measures taken to protect and recover the Recipient\'s data are equivalent to
what it uses in carrying out its own business.     4    5.3 Migration
Projects. Each Provider will provide the applicable Recipient with reasonable
support necessary to transition the Services that such Provider is required
to provide to such Recipient under this Services Agreement, which may include
providing reasonable access to data and other information and to such
Provider\'s employees; provided, however, that such activities shall not
unduly burden or interfere with such Provider\'s business and operations.
Illustrations of migration services are costs of transferring documentation
(including procedures and manuals), removing data from the Provider\'s
systems and records for access by the Recipient and responding to inquiries
associated with software mapping. Each party shall bear the costs that it
incurs in effecting the migration of such Services.   5.4 Further
Assurances. From time to time after the date hereof, without further
consideration, each party shall, upon the reasonable written request of the
other party, execute and deliver such formal lease or license agreements or
any other documentation which may be required to further the intents and
purposes of this Services Agreement with respect to any lease or license
provided for herein or contemplated hereby.   ARTICLE 6   INDEMNITIES AND
WARRANTIES   6.1 Indemnity.   (a) Each party will indemnify and hold
harmless the other party and the officers, directors, agents, employees and
invitees of such other party, against all liabilities, claims, losses,
damages, death or personal injury of whatever nature or kind, arising out of
such party\'s performance of this Services Agreement or the entry of such
party\'s agents, employees or invitees in the premises of the other party, to
the extent occasioned by such party\'s own willful misconduct or negligent
actions or omissions or the willful misconduct or negligent actions or
omissions of the agents, employees or invitees of such party.   (b) Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Related Parties from and
against any and all liabilities, claims, losses or damages arising from or
relating to any intellectual property infringement, including, but not
limited to, such claims based upon Seller\'s infringement or misuse
of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents or other proprietary
rights, arising out of Seller\'s performance of the Seller Provided
Services.   6.2 Warranties.    (a) Each Provider warrants that each
Service provided hereunder by such Provider or its Subsidiaries shall be
performed at an equivalent level of quality in respect of such Service to
that provided by such Provider or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, prior
to the execution date of this Services Agreement. THERE ARE NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF SERVICES
PROVIDED HEREUNDER, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.    5    (b) Each Provider shall (i) pass through to the
applicable Recipient the benefits of any express warranties received from
third parties relating to any Service provided by such Provider to such
Recipient and (ii) assist such Recipient with any warranty claim related to
such Service.   ARTICLE 7   MISCELLANEOUS   7.1 Resolution of Disputes;
Continuation of Services Pending Outcome of Dispute. In the event of any
dispute between the parties, the parties agree to be bound by the litigation
procedures set forth in Section 7.7. Unless otherwise specified in the
Schedules hereto, notwithstanding the existence of any dispute between the
parties, no Provider shall withhold the provision of any Service to any
Recipient under this Services Agreement, unless so provided in a judicial
determination that such Recipient is in default of a material obligation
under this Services Agreement.   7.2 Independent Contractor. In providing
Services hereunder, each Provider and each of its Subsidiaries shall act
solely as an independent contractor. Nothing herein shall constitute or be
construed to be or create a partnership, joint venture or principal/agent
relationship between Buyer or any of its Related Parties, on the one hand,
and Seller or any of its Related Parties, on the other.   7.3 Notices.
Other than the routine administrative actions in furtherance of the Services
to be provided hereunder, all notices, consents, waivers, claims and other
communications hereunder (each a "Notice") shall be in writing and shall be
(a) personally delivered, (b) deposited, prepaid in a nationally established
overnight delivery firm such as Federal Express, (c) mailed by certified
mail, return receipt requested, or (d) transmitted by facsimile as
follows:   If to Seller:   Comfort Systems USA, Inc.  777 Post Oak

any other address which such party may have subsequently communicated to the

this Section 7.3. Each Notice shall be deemed given and effective upon
receipt (or refusal of receipt).   7.4 Entire Agreement. Except for those
matters provided for in the Purchase Agreement, this Services Agreement and
the Schedules attached hereto contain every obligation and understanding
between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and merge all prior
discussions, negotiations and agreement, if any, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and none of the parties shall be bound
by any representations, warranties, covenants or other understandings with
respect to the subject matter hereof, except as expressly provided herein or
in the Purchase Agreement.   7.5 Waiver and Amendment. Any representation,
warranty, covenant, term or condition of this Services Agreement which may
legally be waived, may be waived, or the time of performance thereof
extended, at any time by the party hereto entitled to the benefit thereof,
and any term, condition or covenant hereto may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time. Any such waiver, extension or amendment shall be
evidenced by an instrument in writing executed on behalf of the appropriate
party by a Person who has been authorized by such party to execute waivers,
extensions or amendments on its behalf. No waiver by any party hereto,
whether express or implied, of its rights under any provision of this
Services Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such party\'s rights under
such provisions at any other time or a waiver of such party\'s rights under
any other provision of this Services Agreement. No failure by any party
hereto to take any action against any breach of this Services Agreement or
default by the other party shall constitute a waiver of such party\'s right
to enforce any provision of this Services Agreement or to take action against
such breach or default or any subsequent breach or default by such other
party.   7.6 Severability. In the event that any one or more of
the provisions contained in this Services Agreement shall be declared
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions of this
Services Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and such invalid,
void or unenforceable provision shall be interpreted as closely as possible
to the manner in which it was written.   7.7 Governing Law, Jurisdiction.
This Services Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York. Except where equitable relief is sought,
neither party shall commence any proceeding against the other party under
this Services Agreement unless and until the parties shall have attempted in
good faith to settle the underlying dispute through negotiation or mediation
for a period of not less than 30 days. Subject to the preceding sentence,
each party agrees that any action, proceeding or claim it commences against
the other party pursuant to this Services Agreement shall be brought in any
state or federal courts sitting in Delaware. Each party irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court, any claim that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in such a court has been sought in an inconvenient forum
and the right to object, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over
such party. In any such suit, action or proceeding, each party waives, to the
fullest extent it may effectively do so, personal service of any summons,
complaint or other    7   process and agrees that the service thereof
may be made by certified or registered mail, addressed to such party at its
address set forth in Section 7.3. Each party agrees that a final non-
appealable judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a
court shall be conclusive and binding.   7.8 Counterpart Execution. This
Services Agreement may be executed in counterparts with the same effect as if
all of the parties had signed the same document. Such counterparts shall be
construed together and shall constitute one and the same instrument,
notwithstanding that all of the parties are not signatories to the original
or the same instrument, or that signature pages from different counterparts
are combined. The signature of any party to one counterpart shall be deemed
to be a signature to and may be appended to any other counterpart.   7.9
Assignment. This Services Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns;
provided, however, that this Services Agreement may not be assigned by either
party to any Person without the prior written consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, either party may assign any of its rights and obligations
under this Services Agreement, in whole or in part, to one or more wholly
owned Subsidiaries of such party. Any party so assigning this
Services Agreement shall remain fully liable to the other party for the
performance by any assignee of any obligation of such party so assigned. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Section 7.9 shall be void.   7.10
Disclaimer. Except as expressly set forth herein, no party makes any
representations or warranties in respect of the services provided under this
Services Agreement, express or implied.   7.11 No Third Party Beneficiary.
Nothing expressed or implied in this Services Agreement is intended, or shall
be construed, to confer upon or give any Person other than the parties
hereto, their respective successors and permitted assigns and the
indemnitees, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Services
Agreement.   7.12 Headings and Interpretation. Titles and headings to
articles and sections herein and titles to the Schedules are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Services Agreement. The
Schedules referred to herein shall be construed with and as an integral part
of this Services Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth
verbatim herein.   7.13 Survival. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the rights and obligations of the parties under this Service
Agreement which by their nature would continue beyond the termination of this
Services Agreement, including, but not limited to, the rights and obligations
set forth in Sections 3.3, 6.1, 7.1, 7.3, 7.7 and 7.14, shall survive
termination of this Services Agreement.   7.14 Confidentiality. (a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Services Agreement to the
contrary, each party agrees that, throughout the Term, such party shall
remain subject to (i) all of the terms and conditions of the Mutual
Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of   8   September 5, 2001 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), between Seller and EMCOR Group, Inc., which
Confidentiality Agreement is incorporated herein by reference; and (ii) the
provisions of Section 6.6 of the Purchase Agreement, which are incorporated
herein by reference.   (b) All confidential or proprietary information

Services and relating to the Buyer\'s business shall be treated by Seller as
Confidential Information pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement. In connection with the Seller Provided
Services described on Schedule 2.1(A), Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Related Parties to not, seek access to any financial or other data or
information belonging to Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary without
the written permission of the Buyer.   (c) All confidential or proprietary
information obtained by Buyer in connection with the provision of the Buyer
Provided Services and relating to the Seller\'s business shall be treated by

Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.    9    IN WITNESS
