in regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by
the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such
defense and proceedings; _provided, however_ , __ that the Indemnified Party
