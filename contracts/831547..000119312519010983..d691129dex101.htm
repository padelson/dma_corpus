The above definition of Net Sales is intended to match Buyers revenue
recognition of the Products in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and/or International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) (the "Accounting Standards"). As such, the estimates within
items (a) through (e) will be periodically adjusted by Buyer, prospectively
reflecting its actual experience of issued credits, payment made, and fees
incurred under each deduction category.

 

In the event any Product is sold in combination with other pharmaceutical
products, diagnostic products, or active ingredients
(collectively, "Combination Components"), the Net Sales applicable to such
transaction will be calculated by multiplying the total Net Sales of such
combined product by the fraction A/(A+B), where A is the weighted average
price of the Product in the same dosage amount, formulation, or quantities in

the amount for Buyer to complete such uncompleted RandD Activities. The Upfront

of the 

 



-17-

their respective Affiliates shall take any position on any Tax Return
(including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 or any equivalent statement) or
in connection with any Tax audit claim, or other proceeding which is
inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule unless required to do so
pursuant to a final "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the
Code or corresponding provision of state, local or foreign law). In the event
that the Purchase Price is later adjusted, the Allocation Schedule shall also
be adjusted. To the extent permitted by the Code, the Treasury Regulations
under the Code or other applicable Tax law, any adjustments to the Purchase
Price shall be allocated, to the extent possible, to the classes of assets

Section 2.08 _Non-Assignable Assets_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject to
the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.08_, to the extent that the sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or attempted sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery, to Buyer of any Assigned Contract that would
require a material consent, authorization, approval or waiver of a Person who
is not a Party to this Agreement (including any Governmental Authority), and
such consent, authorization, approval or waiver shall not have been obtained
prior to the Closing despite Sellers good faith and diligent effort to seek
consents to such Contracts prior to Closing ("Non-Assignable Contract"), this
Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery, or an attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery,
thereof; _provided, however_ , that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions contained in _Article VII_ , the Closing shall
occur notwithstanding the foregoing without any adjustment to the Purchase
Price on account thereof. Following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with each other, to
obtain any such required consent, authorization, approval or waiver, or any
release, substitution or amendment required to novate all rights and
obligations under any and all of the Assigned Contracts or to obtain in
writing the unconditional release of all parties to such arrangements, so
that, in any case, Buyer shall solely have the benefit of and be responsible
for such rights and obligations from and after the Closing Date; _provided,
however_ , that neither Party shall be required to pay any
consideration therefor. Once such consent, authorization, approval, waiver,
release, substitution or amendment is obtained, Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer the relevant Assigned Contract to which
such consent, authorization, approval, waiver, release, substitution or
amendment relates for no additional consideration. From and after the Closing,
Seller (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) appoints Buyer as its
attorney-in-fact to act in its name on its behalf, or in the name of the
applicable Subsidiary, and on such Subsidiarys behalf, with regard to each
Non-Assignable Contract. Applicable sales, transfer and other similar Taxes
in connection with such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or license
shall be paid by Buyer in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.09_.

 



-18- 

    

(b) Subject to the last sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.08(b)_, to the
extent that any Contract set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.08(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules is a Non-Assignable Contract, from time to time,
at Buyers request, Seller shall for a period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the earlier of: (i) five (5) years following the Closing Date;
(ii) the date on which such Non-Assignable Contract terminates by its terms
or a new replacement Contract is obtained; and (iii) the date on which Buyer
enters into an agreement with a Third Party to provide substantially the same
services to Buyer as are provided to Seller under the Non-Assignable Contract
(such earlier period, the "Intermediary Period"), act as an intermediary to
provide Buyer the benefit of the terms of such Non-Assignable Contract
(including, without limitation, purchasing on behalf of Buyer any raw
materials or finished products to be supplied under such Non-
Assignable Contract) with all costs and expenses incurred by Seller
thereunder on behalf of Buyer being borne fully by Buyer. For clarity, Seller
shall not charge Buyer for performing Sellers obligation under this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.08(b)_. To the extent that a Third Party consent is not
obtained to any Non-Assignable Contract prior to the Closing, then, during the
Intermediary Period, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate in good faith directly with the Third Party to obtain a Contract in
replacement of the Non-Assignable Contract.

 

(c) If the Contracts set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules are assignable in part, or can otherwise be bifurcated, in each
case, without consent of the Third Party involved in such Contract, Seller
shall assign to Buyer in part, or bifurcate, the Contracts as they relate to
the Product Portfolio. If the Contracts set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_
of the Disclosure Schedules are not assignable without consent of the Third
Party involved in such Contracts, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good
faith to work with the applicable Third Party to bifurcate such non-
assignable Contracts to the extent such Contracts relate to the Product
Portfolio such that Buyer obtains its own Contract covering the subject matter
contained therein as it relates specifically to the Product Portfolio. In the
event that Buyer and Seller are unable to bifurcate the non-assignable
Contracts set forth in _Section 2.08(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedules on or
before the Closing, then, during the Intermediary Period, Seller shall act as
an intermediary to provide Buyer the benefit of the terms of such non-
assignable Contract (including, without limitation, purchasing on behalf of
Buyer any raw materials or finished products to be supplied under such non-
assignable Contract) with all costs and expenses incurred by Seller thereunder
on behalf of Buyer being borne fully by Buyer. For clarity, Seller shall not
charge Buyer for performing Sellers obligation under this _Section_ __ _
2.08(c)_. During the Intermediary Period, Buyer and Seller shall continue to
cooperate to seek bifurcation of the non-assignable Contracts with the Third

Commission; and (v) each PO is cancellable under its terms and the terms of
any Contracts associated with such PO.

 

(i) The Contracts set forth in _Section 2.08(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedules

-33- 

    

 business hours upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, under the
supervision of Sellers or its Subsidiaries personnel or their respective
Representatives and in such a manner as not to interfere with the conduct of
the businesses of Seller. All requests by Buyer for access pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.01_ shall be submitted or directed exclusively to Jefferies
LLC or such other individuals as Seller may designate in writing from time to
time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Seller nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to disclose any information to
Buyer if such disclosure could, in Sellers reasonable discretion: (x) cause
significant competitive harm to Seller and its businesses; (y) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other privilege available to Seller or its Affiliates; or
(z) violate any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, without the
prior written consent of Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
Buyer shall not contact any equity holder of, member of the boards
of directors of, employees of, agents of, suppliers to or customers of,
Seller or its Subsidiaries. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, abide by the terms of the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement with respect to
any access or information provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.01_.

Section 6.02 _Business Employees and Benefits_.

(a) _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)(i)_, of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth each
employee of Seller whose employment duties as of the Closing are primarily
dedicated to the Business (collectively, the "Business Employees"). Buyer
shall offer to employ, as of the Closing Date, those Business Employees set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedules (the
"Selected Sales Employees"). Such offers of employment shall (i) be made no
later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the date hereof, and (ii)
provide each Selected Sales Employee with: (A) a base salary or hourly wages
which are no less than the base salary or hourly wages provided by Seller or
its Subsidiaries to such Selected Sales Employee immediately prior to the
Closing; (B) target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation),
if any, which are no less than the target bonus opportunities (excluding
equity-based compensation) provided by Seller or its Subsidiaries to
such Selected Sales Employee immediately prior to the Closing; (C)
retirement, medical, health and welfare benefits (or the equivalent value
thereof) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by
Buyer to its employees who are similarly situated to the Selected Sales
Employees immediately prior to the Closing; and (D) severance benefits, to the
extent applicable, that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided by Buyer to its employees who are similarly situated to the Selected
Sales Employees immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the "Sales
Offer Standards"). For purposes of clarity, the Sales Offer Standards do not
include offer of employment to be in the same location as immediately prior
to Closing.

(b) Upon execution of this Agreement, and prior to the Closing, Seller shall
make the Business Employees that are not Selected Sales Employees as set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedules (the "Other
Employees") reasonably available to Buyer for interviews. Buyer shall make
offers of employment to each Other Employee whom Buyer selects in its sole
discretion (an "Other Selected Employee"), with such employment to begin upon
Closing.

 



-34- 

    

 Such offers of employment shall (i) be made no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the anticipated Closing, and (ii) provide each Other Selected
Employee with: (A) a base salary or hourly wages which are no less than the
base salary or hourly wages provided by Seller or its Subsidiaries to such
Other Selected Employee immediately prior to the Closing; (B) target bonus
opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation), if any, which are no
less than the target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation)
provided by Seller or its Subsidiaries to such Other Selected Employee
immediately prior to the Closing; (C) retirement, medical, health and welfare
benefits (or the equivalent value thereof) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided by Buyer to its employees who are similarly
situated to the Other Selected Employees immediately prior to the Closing;
and (D) severance benefits, to the extent applicable, that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided by Buyer to its employees who
are similarly situated to the Other Selected Employees immediately prior to
the Closing (collectively, the "Other Offer Standards"). For purposes of
clarity, the Other Offer Standards do not include offer of employment to be in
the same location as immediately prior to Closing. Those Selected Sales
Employees and Other Selected Employee who accept such offers of employment
are collectively referred to herein as the "Transferred Employees."

 

(c) To the extent that Buyer offers employment to a Business Employee and such
employee accepts employment with Buyer, then for twelve (12) months following
the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to provide each
Transferred Employee the compensation required by _Section_ __ _
6.02(a)(ii)(A)-(B)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)(ii)(A)-(B)_, as applicable;
_provided_ , _however_ , unless specifically made otherwise by written
agreement between Buyer and Transferred Employee, all employment of
Transferred Employee by Buyer shall be on an "at will" basis such that Buyer
may change the non-compensation terms of employment of any Transferred
Employee and/or separate any Transferred Employee for any or no reason.

 

(d) With respect to any employee benefit plan, including severance benefits,
vacation and paid time-off plans, policies or practices sponsored or
maintained by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer Benefit
Plans") for the benefit of any Transferred Employee, effective as of the
Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to, recognize all
service of each Transferred Employee with Seller, an Affiliate of Seller or
their respective predecessors, as if such service were with Buyer for all
purposes, including vesting, eligibility, level of benefits and accrual
purposes; _provided, however_ , such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer does not assume, and Seller shall be
fully responsible for the payment of, any accrued payroll, vacation or sick
pay or severance or accrued but unpaid bonuses, all obligations under any
equity based compensation program or other benefits (including all Taxes with
respect to such payments) related to any Transferred Employee prior to the
Closing Date.

 



-35- 

    

(e) Effective as of the Closing, the Transferred Employees shall cease active
participation in any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Seller
or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Seller Benefit Plans"). Seller shall
remain liable for all eligible claims for benefits under the Seller Benefit
Plans that are incurred prior to the Closing.

(f) Effective as of the Closing or as soon thereafter as Buyer is able
utilizing commercially reasonable efforts, Buyer shall, or shall cause an
Affiliate of Buyer to, have in effect a defined contribution plan that is
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that includes a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code
(the "Buyer 401(k) Plan") in which Transferred Employees who meet the
eligibility criteria thereof shall immediately be eligible to participate.
Buyer agrees to cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept eligible rollovers and
transfers by Transferred Employees from the applicable Seller defined
contribution plan, including any promissory notes evidencing outstanding
loans. Buyer agrees that it will cause any Third Party administrators of the
Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept any rollovers or transfers contemplated pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(e)_ no later than thirty (30) days following the
date that Buyer or such Third Party administrator receives the documentation
necessary to process such rollovers or transfers. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall not be obligated to accept rollovers or transfers of
Roth 401(k) balances.

 

(g) Buyer and Seller intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement should not constitute a separation, termination or severance of
employment of any Transferred Employee who accepts an employment offer by
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer on terms required by _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_
or _(b)_ , including for purposes of any Seller Benefit Plan that provides
for separation, termination or severance benefits, and that each such
Transferred Employee will have continuous employment immediately before and
immediately after the Closing. Except as otherwise provided herein,
Seller shall be liable and hold Buyer harmless for: (i) any liability arising
under the WARN Act (and any similar state law) and any statutory, common law,
contractual or other severance with respect to any Other Employee who is not
offered employment by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer on terms required by
_Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_; and (ii) any claims relating to the employment of
any Business Employee prior to the Closing. Seller shall be liable and hold
Buyer harmless for any statutory, common law, contractual or other severance
with respect to any Business Employee (other than the Selected Sales
Employees) who does not receive a job offer from Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer or who declines a job offer from Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer which
job offer meets the Sales Offer Standards or the Other Offer Standards, as
applicable.

(h) At or following the Closing, Seller shall pay in full to each Transferred
Employee all of such Transferred Employees wages, salary, bonus, benefits,
commissions and other compensation, including equity compensation, accrued
prior to the Closing. Seller will withhold or deduct from each

 



-36- 

    

 Transferred Employees salary or transfer to each Transferred Employees
pension, life insurance or incapacity insurance all amounts that Seller is
legally required or contractually obligated to withhold, deduct or transfer,
and Seller shall duly pay such amounts to the appropriate fund or funds.

(i) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, express or implied, shall (i) be
treated as the establishment, amendment or modification of any Seller Benefit
Plan or constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify, merge
or terminate any Seller Benefit Plan before, on or after the Closing, (ii)
limit the rights of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer to terminate the employment
of any individual at any time or for any reason, or (iii) except as provided
in  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_, confer any rights to any Business Employee.

(j) Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(j)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, after the Closing Date, (i) Buyer shall be responsible for all
severance costs, if any, payable to any Transferred Employees and (ii) Seller
shall be responsible for all severance costs payable, if any, to Business
Employees that are not Transferred Employees.

Section 6.03  _Confidentiality_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
Mutual Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in
addition, covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the
provisions of the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement, information by the other
Party in connection with the Transaction Documents (including the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents). Following
the Closing, Confidential Information (as defined in the Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement), to the extent it relates exclusively to the
Business, including the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, shall
become the Confidential Information of Buyer and the terms of the
Mutual Confidentiality Agreement as it relates to such information shall no
longer apply to Buyer; however, Seller shall comply with the terms of the
Mutual Confidentiality Agreement with regards to such information as Buyers
Confidential Information. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated
prior to the Closing, the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ shall nonetheless continue in full force and
effect.

 

Section 6.04 _Governmental Approvals and Consents_.

 

(a) Each Party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, obtain, or cause to be
obtained, all consents, authorizations, Governmental Orders and approvals
from all Governmental Authorities that may be or may become necessary for such

Partys obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. Seller and Buyer mutually commit to instruct their respective
counsel to cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts in
promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations,
Governmental Orders and approvals. The Parties shall not willfully take any
action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the

reasonable best efforts to obtain or make, as applicable, all consents of, and
all filings with, any Governmental Authority required to be obtained or made
by Buyer under any antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority of the United States so as to enable the parties to expeditiously

and meetings with or written submissions to any Governmental Authority with
respect to all consents of, and all filings with, any Governmental Authority
required to be obtained or made by Buyer under any antitrust Law.

Buyer or any of its Affiliates be obligated to propose, or agree to accept,
any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other action

portion of its respective businesses or assets or, after the Closing, to own
or operate all or any portion of the Business.

 

(c) Seller and Buyer shall supply each other with copies of all

or material breach of any provision in _Section_ __ _ 2.08(d)_.

 

Section 8.04 _Certain Limitations_. The Party making a claim under this
_Article VIII_ is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the Party

as the "Indemnifying Party." The indemnification provided for in  _Section_
__ _ 8.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ shall be subject to the following
limitations:

 

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for

_Section_ __ _ 8.02(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ or _Section_ __ _

8.02(b)_,

 



-46- 

    

  _Section_ __ _ 8.02(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.03(b)_ exceeds $1,000,000, at which point, the full amount of all

claim as to which the Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification
under _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_,  _Section_ __ _
8.02(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_, as the case
may be, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any individual Loss
which does not exceed or Losses in the aggregate which do not exceed
$100,000. The limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.04(a)_ shall not
apply to any indemnification obligations arising under _Section_ __ _
8.02(a)_ with respect to inaccuracies in or breaches of the Fundamental
Representations or in the event of actual fraud or indemnification under
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(c)_.

 

(b) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which an Indemnifying Party shall
be liable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.03(b)_, as the case may be, shall not exceed twelve percent (12%) of the
Upfront Purchase Price (the "Cap"); _provided, however_ , that the Cap shall
not apply to any indemnification obligations arising under _Section_ __ _
8.02(a)_ with respect to inaccuracies in or breaches of the Fundamental
Representations or in the event of actual fraud or indemnification under
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(c)_.

 

(c) With respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in  _Section_ __ _ 4.06(e)_ and _Section_ __
_ 4.06(f)_ caused by Seller failing to list a Contract and/or PO required to
be listed on _Section_ __ _ 4.06(e)_ and/or  _Section_ __ _ 4.06(f)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules for the purpose of goods and/or services, the Loss shall
be deemed to be the lesser of: (i) the total amount due under such Contract or
PO or (ii) the amount of the cancellation fee or penalty actually paid by
Buyer to the contracting Third Party in connection with the cancellation or
termination of any such Contract and/or PO.

 

(d) The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
recover under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar
agreements for any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this
Agreement.

Party for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect
damages relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.

commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any
event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise

-47- 

    

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer shall
not have any right to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to, or
based upon, Taxes that (i) are attributable to a taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) are due to the
unavailability in any taxable period (or portion thereof) of any Tax
attribute, (iii) result from transactions or actions outside the ordinary
course of business taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date, or (iv) do not arise from a Third Party Claim.

Section 8.05 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve, waive or otherwise release the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except to the extent that such failure to notify
materially and adversely prejudices the Indemnifying Party, and then, only to
the extent of such prejudice. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall
describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail and indicate the estimated
amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. During such thirty (30)-day period, the Indemnified Party
shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnifying Partys investigation by giving such information and
assistance (including the right to examine any documents or records
exclusively related to such Direct Claim) as the Indemnifying Party or any of
its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party
does not so respond within such thirty (30)-day period, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified
Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

 

(b) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other Legal
Proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a Party to this Agreement
or an Affiliate of a Party to this Agreement or a Representative of the
foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with respect
to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except to the extent that such failure to notify materially and
adversely prejudices the Indemnifying Party, and then, only to the extent of
such prejudice. Such notice by the Indemnified

 



-48- 

    

 Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and indicate
the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or
may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to participate in or, by giving written notice to the Indemnified
Party, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Partys expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own recognized and reputable
counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense; provided, that (i) prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming control
of such defense it shall first verify to the Indemnified Party in writing
that such Indemnifying Party shall be fully responsible (with no reservation
of any rights) for all Losses relating to such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such
defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Party) if
(A) such Third Party Claim involves criminal liability, (B) such Third Party
Claim involves a customer or supplier of the Indemnified Party or its business
or if an adverse determination with respect to such Third Party Claim could
reasonably be expected to be materially detrimental to or injure the
Indemnifying Partys reputation or business prospects, (C) such Third Party
Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party
or its business and the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that such
injunction or equitable relief would materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Party or its business, (D) in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnified Party there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived with
respect to such Third Party Claim, or (E) the Losses relating to such Third
Party Claim would reasonably be expected to exceed the maximum amount that the
Indemnified Party would be entitled to recover under this _Article VIII_. In
the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.05(c)_, it shall have the right to
take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or
make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right,
at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any Third Party
Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to
control the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to pay,
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.05(c)_,
pay, compromise or defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for
any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party
Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection
with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available (subject
to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.03_) records relating to such Third
Party Claim and furnishing to the defending Party of management employees of
the non-defending Party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of
the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 



-49- 

    

(c) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of
any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless
such settlement or judgment will result in the Indemnified Party being liable
for an amount of Losses which are not indemnified hereunder that are in excess
of the amounts for which the Indemnified Party is indemnified hereunder and
except as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 8.05(c)_. If a firm settlement
offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or
the creation of a financial or other obligation or any harm whatsoever on the
part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying
Party desires to accept and agree to such settlement offer, the Indemnifying
Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such settlement offer within thirty
(30) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may
continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim shall
not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails
to consent to such settlement offer and also fails to assume defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim
upon the terms set forth in such settlement offer to settle such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.05(b)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

 

Section 8.06 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

 

Section 8.07 _Exclusive Remedies_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
VIII_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement it may have against the other Parties and their Affiliates and
each of their respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Law,
except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
VIII_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.07_ shall limit any Persons right
to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ or to seek any remedy on account of any
fraud by either Party or their Affiliates and each of their respective
Representatives.

 



-50- 

    

Section 8.08 _Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) At any time before the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing (the
"Escrow Period"), if Buyer determines on a commercially reasonable basis that
a PO should be cancelled and such cancellation results in Buyers incurrence
of any cancellation fees or penalties, Buyer may seek withdrawal of funds from
the Escrow Fund, by providing documentary evidence of the cancellation fee or
penalty that Buyer was required to pay for cancellation of the PO. For
clarity, Buyer may not seek withdrawal of funds from the Escrow Fund with
respect to a particular PO if Buyer obtains indemnification under _Section_
__ _ 8.02(a)_ with respect to such PO.

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the Escrow Period
(the "Escrow Release Date"), Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver to
Escrow Agent written instructions instructing Escrow Agent to release and
deliver to Seller the balance of the Escrow Fund (and all earnings thereon).

ARTICLE IX

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)(iii)_ shall
not be available to a Party if the issuance of such final non-appealable

 Governmental Order is directly caused by a failure of such Party to perform
or comply with any of its covenants, agreements or other obligations contained
in _Article VI_ ; and _provided, further_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)(iii)_ shall not be
available to a Party if such Party has not complied with _Section_ __ _

result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)_ or

their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) and (B) is
not capable of being cured prior to the Drop Dead Date; or

breach of any provision of this Agreement and there has been a material

covenant or agreement made by Buyer pursuant to _Article V_ or _Article VI_ ,
which (i) would result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_

Closing) and (ii) is not capable of being cured prior to the Drop Dead Date.

construed with, and be an integral part of, this Agreement to the same extent
as if they were set forth verbatim herein.

Section 10.04 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in

to the greatest extent possible.

 



-54- 

    

Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect
to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede all prior
and contemporaneous representations, warranties, understandings
and agreements, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter.
In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this
Agreement and those in the other Transaction Documents, the Exhibits and
Disclosure Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in
the Disclosure Schedules), the statements in the body of this Agreement will
control.

 

Section 10.06 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Neither Party may assign or delegate, by operation of
law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the other Party, which may be withheld
in its absolute discretion; _provided, however_ , that Buyer may assign any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part without the
prior written consent of Seller to (a) any of its Affiliates, (b) any
subsequent purchaser of Buyer or in connection with any disposition or
transfer of all or a material portion of its assets or the Business, in any
form of transaction, or (c) any of its lenders as collateral security. No
assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Any purported assignment without the prior written consent required
by, or as otherwise permitted under, this _Section_ __ _ 10.06_, shall be
void.

Section 10.07 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 6.02_, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties

express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person
any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.08 _Amendment and Modification; Waiver_. This Agreement may only be
amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each
Party. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so
waiving. No waiver by any Party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in
respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such
written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether
occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement
shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.

Section 10.09  _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of
action (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_. Each of the Parties
irrevocably agrees that any Legal Proceeding based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder or thereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment
in respect of this Agreement or other Transaction Documents and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder or thereunder brought by the other Party or its
successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the
State of Delaware, or, if both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the federal
courts within the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any other state court within the State of Delaware, and, in
each case, any appellate court therefrom. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Legal Proceeding for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any Legal Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby: (a) any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named
courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 10.10_; (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise); and (c) to the fullest extent permitted
by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the Legal Proceeding in such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Legal Proceeding
is improper or (iii) this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the
Parties agrees that service of process upon such Party in any such Legal
Proceeding shall be effective if such process is given as a notice in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.02_. Buyer agrees that if Seller obtains a
judgment against Buyer in any of the foregoing courts arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, Seller may bring an action
with respect to the recognition and enforcement thereof in a court in any
jurisdiction whatsoever, and Buyer hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to
assert by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, any
contention that such judgment of any of the foregoing courts may not be
recognized or enforced in whole or in part.

Section 10.11  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES
AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE 

 



-56- 

    

 FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
10.11_.

 

Section 10.12 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and expressly agrees that
monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate such Party for any breach
by the other Party or any of the other Partys Affiliates of any covenants
and agreements set forth herein. Accordingly, each Party agrees and
acknowledges that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by a Party
or a Partys Affiliates will cause irreparable injury to the other Party and
that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in law, in
equity or otherwise, the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance and
other injunctive relief against the continued breach of this Agreement or the
threatened breach thereof, without the necessity of proving actual damages.
Each Party also agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
a bond in connection with obtaining a Party obtaining specific performance or
other equitable relief pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_. No equitable
remedies referred to above will be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a
breach of this Agreement, but rather will be in addition to all other
remedies available under this Agreement, at law or in equity to the Parties.

Section 10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed
to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.14 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any claim, action, suit or other Legal Proceeding based upon, arising out
of or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement, may only be brought against, the entities that
are expressly named as Parties and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to each such Party. Except as set
forth in _Section 10.6_ of this Agreement, no past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any Party
or of any Affiliate of any Party, or any of their successors or permitted
assigns, shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any
Party under this Agreement or for any claim, action, suit or other Legal
Proceeding based on, in respect of or by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 11.01 Representations and Warranties. Parent Guarantor represents and
warrants to Seller, as of the date hereof, as follows:

(a) Parent Guarantor has all necessary corporate power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and to carry out the Obligation. The execution and
delivery by Parent Guarantor of this Agreement, the performance by Parent
Guarantor of its Obligation and the consummation by Parent Guarantor of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action on the part of Parent Guarantor. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Parent Guarantor, and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Seller) this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of Parent Guarantor solely with respect to the
Obligation, enforceable against Parent Guarantor in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 

(b) As of the Closing, Parent Guarantor shall have sufficient cash on hand or
other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to fulfill the
Obligation and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 11.02 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent Guarantor irrevocably and
unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantees (a) the prompt payment by
Buyer now or hereafter of amounts owed to Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.05_ of this Agreement and (b) the performance of Buyer and its Affiliates
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.07(b)(ii)_, (the
guarantees under clauses (a) and (b) collectively referred to herein as the
"Obligations"), and does hereby agree that if the Obligations or any portion
thereof is not paid by or performed by Buyer, Parent Guarantor will make such
payments or cause such performance, as applicable, upon written demand by
Seller. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent Guarantor hereby waives, for
the benefit of Seller and solely with respect to the Obligations: (i) any
right to require Seller, as a condition of performance by Parent Guarantor, to
(A) proceed against Buyer or any other Person, or (B) pursue any other remedy
in the power of Seller whatsoever; (ii) any defense arising by reason of the
incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of Buyer
including any defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or
the unenforceability of the Obligations or any agreement or instrument
relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of Buyer from
any cause other than complete performance of the Obligations; (iii) (A) any
principles or provisions of Law that are or might be in conflict with the
terms of this _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ and any legal or equitable discharge of
the Obligations hereunder, (B) the benefit of any statute of limitations
affecting Parent Guarantors liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof,
(C) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims, and (D) promptness,
diligence and any requirement that Seller protect, secure, perfect or insure
any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto; (iv) notices,
demands, presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and
notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance hereof, notices of
default under the Agreement or any Transaction Documents or any agreement or
instrument related hereto or thereto; and (v) to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by
Law that limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or that
may conflict with the terms of the Obligations hereunder. This _Section_ __ _
11.02_ shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by
the successors and permitted assigns of Parent Guarantor.
