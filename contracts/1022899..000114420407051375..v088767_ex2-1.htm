**ARTICLE  II**

 

 

**EFFECTS  OF THE MERGER**

 

 

2.1 Effect  on  Capital Stock.

 

 

At  the  Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part  of  the holder of any shares of the Company Common Stock:

 

 

(a) _Excluded  Stock_.  Each  and all shares of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Company (the  " _Company  Common Stock_ ")  owned  by
Company or any Company Subsidiary (or held as treasury stock) or by Parent, 
Merger Co. or any Parent Subsidiary immediately before the Effective Time 
(collectively, the " _Excluded  Shares_ ")  shall  be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and no shares of common stock, par  value  $0.01 per share,
of Parent (the " _Parent  Common Stock_ ")  or  other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(b) _Conversion  of the Company Common Stock_.  Subject  to Section 2.3,
each share of the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and  shares  to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)) shall be canceled and 
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive that
number  of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the  Exchange Ratio (as such term is defined below) (together with any
cash paid  in  respect of fractional  shares in accordance with Section
2.3, the " _Merger  Consideration_ ").  Upon  such conversion, all such
shares of the Company Common Stock shall no longer  be  outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall  cease  to exist,
and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall 
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in 
respect of such shares upon the surrender of the certificate representing 
such  shares in accordance with Section 2.2 (or in the case of a lost, stolen
or  destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if
required)  in  the manner provided in Section 2.4).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) _Merger  Co. Capital Stock_.  Each  share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Co. outstanding  immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically converted  into  and become one fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the  Surviving Corporation.
Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares  of  common stock of
Merger Co. shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares  of  common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(d) _Further  Adjustments_.  If,  between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the shares of  Parent  Common Stock or Company Common
Stock outstanding shall have changed, by reason  of any reclassification,
subdivision, recapitalization, stock split (including  reverse stock split)
or stock dividend (each an " _Adjustment  Event_ "),  then  the Exchange
Ratio and/or the amount of the Merger Consideration that would  otherwise be
payable in shares of Parent Common Stock or in respect of shares  of 
Company Common Stock and other definitions and provisions of this Agreement 
dependent thereon, shall be equitably adjusted to give effect to such event. 

 

 

(e) _Dissenting  Shares_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent shall  not be  obligated to deliver any Merger
Consideration to any stockholder of the Company  with respect to any shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately  prior  to the Effective
Time that are held by a stockholder who is eligible to demand  and perfect
dissenter's rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262  _et  seq._
  of the  DGCL and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's
right to such  appraisal. To the extent that Section 262 _et  seq._   of
the  DGCL provides for dissenter's rights for any such shares of Company
Common Stock  in the Merger (each, a " _Dissenting  Share_ "),  such 
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the 
applicable Merger Consideration as provided above, unless and until such 
holder  fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right
to  appraisal and payment under Section 262 _et  seq._   of the  DGCL, but
the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are  granted by
Section 262 _et  seq._   of the  DGCL and shall not be entitled to vote or
to exercise any other rights of  a  stockholder of the Company except as
provided by Section 262 _et  seq._   of the  DGCL. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment therefor  pursuant to
Section 262 _et  seq._   of the  DGCL shall receive such payment from the
Surviving Corporation in accordance  with Section 262 _et  seq._   of the 
DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or 
withdraws or loses such holder's right to dissent, such holder's Dissenting 
Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the 
Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration,  if  any, to which such holder is entitled, without interest
or dividends thereon.  The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of
any notices of intent  to  demand payment received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and  any  other instrument served pursuant to
Section 262 _et  seq._   of the  DGCL and received by Company. Parent shall
be entitled to direct all  negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under  the  DGCL.

(f) _Definition  of Exchange Ratio and Related Terms_.  For  the  purposes
of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings ascribed  to  them
below:

 

 

(i) " _Exchange_ _  Ratio_ " means  a  number equal to the quotient of X
divided by Y, where X is the number of  shares  constituting the Aggregate
Number of Issuable Parent Shares (as such term  is  defined below) and Y
equals the number of shares of Fully Diluted Company  Capital Stock (as such
term is defined below), as adjusted to reflect  appropriately the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend  (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Parent  Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other  like  change
with respect to the Parent Common Stock occurring on or after the  date 
hereof and before the Effective Time.

 

 

(ii) " _Aggregate  Number of Issuable Parent Shares_ " means:  (A) eleven
million nine hundred seventeen thousand five hundred twenty  (11,917,520), if
the Contingent Matters (as is defined below in Section 4.2(p))  shall have
been resolved in accordance with the requirements and conditions  specified
on Section 4.2(p) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and (B) eleven  million
forty-five thousand eighty-one (11,045,081), if the Contingent Matters  shall
not have been resolved in accordance with the requirements and conditions 
specified on Section 4.2(p) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

(iii) " _Fully  Diluted Company Capital Stock_ " means  those shares of
Company Common Stock (A) issued and outstanding immediately  before the
Effective Time, (B) issuable upon full exercise of Company Options  and
Company Warrants that are issued and outstanding immediately before the 
Effective Time, and (C) issuable upon conversion and/or exercise of all
other  securities convertible into, or exercisable for, Company Common Stock
that  are  issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time.

 

 

2.2 Surrender  and Payment.

 

 

(a) Parent  shall appoint an agent (the " _Exchange  Agent_ ")  reasonably
acceptable to Company for the purpose of exchanging certificates  which
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company  Common 
Stock (the " _Certificates_ ")  for  the applicable Merger Consideration
pursuant to an exchange agent agreement  in  form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Company. At or as promptly  as  practicable (and, in any
event, within two (2) business days) after the  Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with  the  Exchange Agent, the
Merger Consideration to be exchanged or paid in accordance  with this Article
II, and Parent shall make available from time to time after  the Effective
Time as necessary, cash in an amount sufficient to pay any  cash  payable in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3 and any dividends  or
distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be 
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). The Surviving Corporation shall send, 
or  shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of
shares  of  Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
whose shares  were  converted into the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration pursuant  to Section 2.1, promptly after the Effective
Time, (i) a letter of transmittal  for use in such exchange (which shall be
in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to Parent and Company and
shall specify that the delivery shall  be  effected, and risk of loss and
title in respect of the Certificates shall  pass,  only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and  (ii)  instructions to effect
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for  the  applicable Merger
Consideration, cash payable in respect thereof in lieu  of any  fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.3 and any dividends or other  distributions
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section  2.2(c).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Each  holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into a  right  to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, cash payable
in respect thereof  in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3
and any dividends  or  other distributions payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.2(c),  upon  surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate or Certificates, together  with  a properly completed letter of
transmittal covering such shares and such  other  documents as the Exchange
Agent may reasonably require, shall be entitled  to  receive the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares  of  Company Common
Stock. The holder of such Certificate, upon its delivery thereof  to the
Exchange Agent, shall also receive any dividends or other distributions  to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and cash payable 
in  respect of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3. Certificates 
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled as of the Effective Time. Until so 
surrendered, each such Certificate, following the Effective Time, shall 
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable Merger 
Consideration, cash payable in respect thereof in lieu of any fractional 
shares  pursuant to Section 2.3 and any dividends or other distributions
payable  in  respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.2(c). No interest shall
be paid or  accrued  for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on cash
amounts payable upon  the  surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this
Section 2.2.

 

 

(c) Whenever  a dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the
date hereof  with  respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time,  such  declaration shall include a dividend or other
distribution in respect of  all  shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends  or other distributions declared or
made after the Effective Time with respect  to  Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be  paid to  the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Parent Common  Stock such
holder is entitled to receive until the holder of such Certificate  shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with the provisions of this  Section
2.2. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such  Certificate,
there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates  representing
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,  at the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions  with
a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect  to 
such Parent Common Stock.

 

 

(d) If  a  transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not
registered  in the  stock transfer books or ledger of Company, or if any
certificate for the  applicable Merger Consideration is to be issued in a
name other than that  in  which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it  shall  be a condition to the issuance thereof
that the Certificate or Certificates  so  surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for  transfer and that the Person
requesting such exchange shall have paid to  the  Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required as a result of the issuance  of a
certificate for Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the 
registered holder of such shares of Company Common Stock, or establish to 
the  satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not  payable. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Person_ " means  an
individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership,  an 
association, a trust or any other entity or organization, including a
government  or political subdivision or any agency or instrumentality
thereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) After  the  Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares  of  Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificate formerly  representing shares of Company Common Stock is
presented to the Surviving  Corporation, it shall be canceled and exchanged
for the applicable Merger  Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth,  in  this Article II.

 

 

(f) None  of  Parent, Merger Co., Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or  affiliates shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock  for  any Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any  applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

 

 

(g) Each  of  the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
be entitled  to  deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to any  holder of shares of Company Common Stock, and from any cash
dividends or  other  distributions that the holder is entitled to receive
under Section 2.2(c),  such  amounts as the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent is required  to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the  Code, or any provision of United States ("
_U.S._ ")  federal, state or local tax law or any other non-U.S. tax law or
any other  applicable legal requirement. To the extent that  amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation  or  Parent, such
amounts withheld from the Merger Consideration and other such  amounts
payable under Section 2.2(c) shall be treated for all purposes of  this 
Agreement as having been received by the holder of the shares of Company 
Common  Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the  Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent.

 

 

(h) Any  portion of the certificates evidencing the Parent Common Stock, the
cash  to be  paid in respect of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3,
and the cash  or  other property in respect of dividends or other
distributions pursuant to  Section 2.2(c) supplied to the Exchange Agent
which remains unclaimed by  the  holders of shares of Company Common Stock
twelve (12) months after the Effective  Time shall be returned to Parent,
upon demand, and any such holder who has  not  exchanged such holder's
shares of Company Common Stock for the applicable Merger  Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.2 prior to the time of demand  shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the applicable Merger 
Consideration, and any cash payable in respect thereof in lieu of any
fractional  shares pursuant to Section 2.3 and any dividends or distributions
with respect  to Parent Common Stock to which they were entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c),  in each case, without interest.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.3 Fractional  Shares.

 

 

No  certificates representing less than one share of Parent Common Stock
shall  be  issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender  for  exchange of a Certificate. In lieu of any such fractional
share, each holder  of  shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise
have been entitled to  a  fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon
surrender of Certificates  for  exchange (or in the case of a lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, upon  delivery of an affidavit, and bond, if
required by the Exchange Agent, in  the  manner provided in Section 2.4)
shall be paid upon such surrender (and after  taking into account and
aggregating shares of Company Common Stock represented  by all Certificates
surrendered by such holder) cash (without interest) in  an  amount equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share  interest to
which such holder (after taking into account and aggregating  all  shares of
Company Common Stock represented by all Certificates surrendered  by  such
holder) would otherwise be entitled by (b) the average closing price  for a 
share of Parent Common Stock on its principal trading market or exchange 
during  the ten (10) consecutive trading day period ending with (and
including) the  third trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time
(the " _Average  Closing Price_ "). 

 

 

2.4 Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.

 

 

In  the  event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange  Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates,  upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the  applicable Merger Consideration, any cash payable in
respect thereof in lieu  of  any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3
and any dividends or other  distributions as may be required pursuant to this
Article II in respect of  the  shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed  Certificates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance  thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates  to  deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against  any  claim that may be made against Parent or the
Exchange Agent with respect  to the  Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

 

2.5 Company  Options.

 

 

(a) Prior  to  the Effective Time, Company and its Subsidiaries shall take
all actions  necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time,
options to purchase  shares of the Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company 
Option_ ")  held  by any employee, consultant, independent contractor and
director which are  outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall
be converted into  and  become options to purchase shares of Parent Common
Stock (each, a " _Converted  Option_ "),  in  each case, on terms
substantially identical to those in effect immediately  prior  to the
Effective Time under the terms of the stock incentive plan or other  related
agreement or award pursuant to which such Company Option was granted. 
Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time, (i) each such Converted
Option  may be exercised solely to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock,
(ii) the  number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such Converted  Option shall be equal to the number of shares of the Company
Common Stock  that  were issuable upon exercise under the corresponding
Company Option immediately  prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio and rounded  up to  the nearest whole share, (iii) the per
share exercise price under such Converted  Option shall be determined by
dividing the per share exercise price of the  corresponding Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the  Exchange Ratio and rounded up
to the nearest whole cent, (iv) any restriction  on  the exercise of any
such Company Option shall continue in full force and  effect  and the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such  Company Option
shall otherwise remain unchanged; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  each
Company Option assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 2.5 
shall,  in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as
appropriate  to  reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares,
stock dividend,  reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization  or other similar transaction after the
Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the option
price, number of shares purchasable pursuant to each such so  Converted
Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of each such so  Converted
Option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 409A  of the 
Code and for any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies 
by  reason of its qualification under any of Sections 422 through 424 of
the  Code,  the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to
each such  so  Converted Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of
each such so  Converted Option shall be determined in order to comply with
Section 424  of the  Code.

(b) Parent  shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of
the Company  Options pursuant to this Section 2.5, including the reservation,
issuance  and  listing of Parent Common Stock as is necessary to effectuate
the transactions  contemplated by this Section 2.5. Parent shall prepare and
file a registration  statement with the SEC on an appropriate form, or a
post-effective amendment  to  a registration statement previously filed
under the Securities Act (as defined  in Section 3.1(b)(iv)), with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock  issuable with respect to the Company
Options assumed by Parent in accordance  with this Section 2.5 and, where
applicable, shall use all commercially  reasonable efforts to have such
registration statement declared effective  as  soon as practicable following
the Effective Time and to maintain the  effectiveness of such registration
statement covering such Converted Options  (and to maintain the current
status of the prospectus contained therein)  for so  long as such Converted
Options remain outstanding. With respect to those  individuals, if any, who,
subsequent to the Effective Time, will be subject  to  the reporting
requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (as defined  in Section
3.1(c)(iii)), where applicable, Parent shall use all commercially  reasonable
efforts to administer the Company Options assumed pursuant to  this  Section
2.5 in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the  Exchange
Act to the extent such Company Options complied with such rule prior  to 
the Merger.

 

 

2.6 Company  Warrants.

 

 

Prior  to  the Effective Time, Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all
actions  necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time, each
warrant  to  purchase shares of the Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Company  Warrant_ ")  which  is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be converted  into  and become a warrant to purchase
shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a " _Converted  Warrant_ ")  on 
terms substantially identical to those in effect immediately prior to the 
Effective Time under the terms of the warrant or other related agreement 
or  award pursuant to which such Company Warrant was granted; provided,
however,  that, subject to the terms of the Company Warrants, from and after
the Effective  Time, (i) each such Converted Warrant may be exercised solely
to purchase  shares  of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock  issuable upon exercise of such Converted Warrant shall
be equal to the number  of  shares of the Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise under  the  corresponding Company Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied  by the Exchange Ratio and rounded up
to the nearest whole share and (iii)  the  per share exercise price under
such Converted Warrant shall be determined  by  dividing the per share
exercise price of the corresponding Company Warrant  immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio and rounded  up to  the nearest whole
cent. The Converted Warrants and the Converted Options  are  hereinafter
referred to as " _Converted  Equity Awards_ ".

Except,  with respect to any subsection of this Section 3.1, as set forth in
the  correspondingly identified subsection of the disclosure schedule
delivered  by  Parent to Company concurrently herewith (the " _Parent 
Disclosure Schedule_ ")  (it  being understood by the parties that the
information disclosed in one subsection  of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to be included in each  other  subsection of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule in which the relevance of such  information thereto would
be reasonably apparent on the face  thereof)  or as  disclosed in, and
reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure included  in  any report,
schedule, form or other document filed with or furnished to the  SEC  ("
_Parent  Filed SEC Documents_ ")  and  publicly available prior to the date
of this Agreement (except in each case  for  the risk factors section and
any forward looking statements contained in  the  Management's Discussion and
Analysis), provided that in no event shall any  disclosure in any Parent
Filed SEC Document qualify or limit the representations  and warranties of
the Parent set forth in Sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c), or  3.1(d),  Parent 
represents and warrants to Company as follows:

and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each 
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing 
of  its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in such
other  jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify and be in such standing
would  not,  either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a  material adverse effect on Parent. The Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws  of Parent, copies  of  which are attached to
Section 3.1(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, are  true,  complete and
correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of  this

validly issued and are fully paid  and, except as set forth in the DGCL, non
assessable and are not subject  to  preemptive rights. The shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant  to or  as specifically contemplated by

to preemptive rights.

other instruments issued after the date of this Agreement as permitted by 
Section 4.1, there are no options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or 
agreements of any character to which Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent is 
a  party or by which it or any such Subsidiary is bound obligating Parent

issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital  stock or any Voting
Debt or stock appreciation rights or ownership interests  of  Parent or of

(as defined in Section 3.1(m)). The execution and delivery  of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby  have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of  Parent, except

Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable 
against Parent in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency,  fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
of general  applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
general  equitable principles.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) The  execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of  the  transactions contemplated hereby will not, (A)
conflict with, or result  in  any violation of, or constitute a default
(with or without notice or lapse  of  time, or both) under, or give rise to
a right of termination, cancellation,  modification or acceleration of any
obligation or the loss of a material  benefit  under, or the creation of a
lien, pledge, security interest, charge or other  encumbrance on any assets
(any such conflict, violation, default, right of  termination, cancellation,
modification or acceleration, loss or creation,  a " _Violation_ ") 
pursuant to, any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws 
of  Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, or (B) subject to obtaining or
making  the  consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations  and  filings referred to in paragraph (iii) below, result in
any Violation of  any  loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage, indenture,
lease, Parent Benefit  Plan  (as defined in Section 3.1(i)) or other
agreement, obligation, instrument,  permit, concession, franchise, license,
judgment, order, decree, statute,  law,  ordinance, rule or regulation

individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to (x)  have 
a material adverse effect on Parent or (y) prevent, delay or impede Parent's 
ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the
transactions  contemplated hereby.

 

 

(iii) No  consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration  or  filing with, any court, administrative agency or commission
or other  governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a "
_Governmental  Entity_ ")  is  required by or with respect to Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent in connection  with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent or the consummation  by Parent of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the failure to make or  obtain  which, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to  (x)  have a material
adverse effect on Parent or (y) prevent, delay or impede  Parent's ability to
perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the  transactions
contemplated hereby, except for (A) the filing with the SEC  of the  Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 and such other reports  under 
the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) _SEC  Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_. 

 

 

(i) Parent  has filed, or furnished, as applicable, all required reports,
schedules,  registration statements and other documents with the SEC since
February 12,  2007  (the " _Parent  SEC Documents_ ").  As of  their
respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded  by a 
filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such filing), the Parent 
SEC  Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the  Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and  regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC
Documents,  and  none of the Parent SEC  Documents when filed contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or  omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary  to  make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they  were  made, not misleading.
The financial statements of Parent included in the  Parent  SEC Documents
complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing  with  the SEC,
in all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements  and
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto 
and, (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form
10-QSB  of the SEC), have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except  as  may be disclosed therein) and fairly present in all
material respects the  consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries  and  the consolidated results of operations,
changes in stockholders' equity and cash  flows of such companies as of the
dates and for the periods shown. Except  for  any comments issued on the
Parent's Registration Statement on Form SB-2 filed  with the SEC on May 16,
2007, there are no outstanding comments from the  Staff  of the SEC with
respect to any of the Parent SEC Documents.

 

 

(ii) Except  for (A) those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved
for in the  consolidated balance sheet of Parent as of June 30, 2007 included
in the  financial statements of Parent included in its Quarterly Report on
Form 10-QSB  for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2007, as filed with the
SEC prior to  the  date of this Agreement (the " _Parent  Financial
Statements_ "),  (B)  liabilities incurred since June 30, 2007 in the

which were not required to  be set  forth in the last consolidated balance
sheet of Parent included in the Parent  Financial Statements, (D) liabilities

since December 31, 2006, Parent and its  Subsidiaries have not incurred
(except as permitted by Section 4.1), any  liabilities or obligations of any
nature whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute,  matured, determined,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not required  to be  reflected in
Parent's financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) _Compliance  with Applicable Laws and Reporting Requirements_. 

 

 

(i) Parent  and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances,
exemptions, orders  and approvals of all Governmental Entities which are
material to the operation  of the businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole (the " _Parent  Permits_ ")  and  Parent and its
Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance with the terms  of  the Parent
Permits and all applicable laws and regulations and their own  privacy 
policies, except where the failure so to comply, individually or in the 
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect  on  Parent.

 

 

(ii) The  businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries are not being and have
not been  conducted in violation of any material law, ordinance or regulation
of any  Governmental Entity (including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002).

 

 

(iii) Parent  and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a system of
internal controls  over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of  the  Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements  for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting  principles. Parent (A) has designed and
maintains disclosure controls and  procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)  to  ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the  reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,  summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and  forms and is
accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as appropriate  to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (B) has disclosed,  based
on its most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures 
prior to the date hereof, to Parent's auditors and the audit committee of 
Parent's Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies and material 
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial 
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material 
respect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial 
information and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management  or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's
internal controls  over financial reporting.

 

 

(iv) There  are  no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
Parent or any  Parent  Subsidiary to any executive officer (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange  Act) or director of Parent. Parent has not,
since the enactment of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

 

 

(f) _Legal  Proceedings_.  There  is no claim, suit, action, litigation,
arbitration, investigation or other  demand or proceeding (whether judicial,
arbitral, administrative or other)  pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened, against or affecting  Parent  or any Subsidiary of Parent as to
which there is a reasonable possibility  of an  adverse outcome which would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material  adverse effect on Parent,
nor, except as disclosed in Section 3.1(f) of the  Parent Disclosure
Schedule, is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule,  award,
settlement, stipulation or order of or subject to any Governmental  Entity 
or arbitrator outstanding against Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. To 
the  knowledge of Parent, no investigation by any Governmental Entity with
respect  to  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) _Taxes_.  Parent  and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all material
tax returns required  to be  filed by any of them when due in accordance
with all applicable laws (and  each  such tax return is, or shall be at the
time of filing, true and complete  in all  material respects) and have paid
(or Parent has paid on their behalf) all  taxes  shown as due on such
returns, and the most recent financial statements contained  in the Parent
SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve, in accordance with  generally
accepted accounting principles, for all taxes payable by Parent  and  its
Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such financial statements. No 
material deficiencies or other claims for any taxes have been proposed,
asserted  or assessed against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that are not
adequately  reserved for. There is no claim, audit or suit now pending or, to
the knowledge  of Parent, threatened against or with respect to Parent or its
Subsidiaries  in  respect of any federal or state income tax; additionally,
no claim or suit  regarding an amount of tax is now pending in connection
with ( _x_ )  any  other tax return or ( _y_ )  circumstances where no tax
return has been filed. For the purpose of this  Agreement, the term " _tax_
"  (including, with correlative meaning, the terms " _taxes_ " and  "
_taxable_ ")  shall  mean (i) all Federal, state, local and foreign income,
profits, franchise,  gross  receipts, payroll, sales, employment, use,
property, withholding, excise,  occupancy and other taxes, duties or
assessments of any nature whatsoever,  together with all interest, penalties
and additions imposed with respect  to such  amounts, (ii) liability for the
payment of any amounts of the type described  in  clause (i) as a result of
being or having been a member of an affiliated,  consolidated, combined or
unitary group, and (iii) liability for the payment  of  any amounts as a
result of being party to any tax sharing agreement or as  a  result of any 
express or implied obligation to indemnify any other person with respect  to
the  payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (i) or (ii).
Neither  Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates has taken or agreed
to take  any  action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other
circumstance that could  reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization  within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

 

 

(h) _Certain  Agreements_.  Except  as disclosed in or filed as exhibits to
the Parent's Annual Report on Form  10-KSB for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2006 or Parent SEC Documents  filed  subsequent to such Annual Report on
Form 10-KSB and prior to the date of  this  Agreement and except for this
Agreement and  as  set forth on Section 3.1(h) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule,  neither  Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by any contract,  arrangement, commitment or understanding (i) with
respect to the service  of any  directors, officers, employees, involving
the payment of $50,000 or more  in any  12 month period, (ii) with respect
to the service of any independent contractors  or consultants that are
natural persons involving the payment of $50,000  or more  in any 12 month
period, entered into other than in the ordinary course of  business, (iii)
which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined below),  (iv) which
limits the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to compete  in  any
line of business, in any geographic area or with any person,  or which
requires referrals of business and, in each case, which limitation  or 
requirement would reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its 
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (v)  with  or to a labor union or guild
(including any collective bargaining agreement),  (vi) which is a contract,
arrangement or understanding entered into other  than  in the ordinary
course of business,  with a  content provider involving the payment of
$50,000 or more in any 12 month  period  or (vi) which would prevent, delay
or impede the consummation, or otherwise  reduce the contemplated benefits,
of any of the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement. Parent has
previously made available to Company or its  representatives complete and
accurate copies of each contract, arrangement,  commitment or understanding
of the type described in this Section 3.1(h)  (collectively referred to
herein as "Parent Contracts"). All of the Parent  Contracts are valid and in
full force and effect, except to the extent they  have  previously expired
in accordance with their terms. Neither Parent nor any  of its  Subsidiaries
has, or is alleged to have, and to the knowledge of Parent,  none of  the
other parties thereto have, violated any provision of, or committed or 
failed to perform any act, and no event or condition exists, which, with 
or  without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default under
the  provisions of, any Parent Contract, except in each case for those
violations  and  defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be  expected to deprive  Parent and its Subsidiaries in any
material respect of the benefits of such  Parent Contracts subject to such
violations and defaults.  For  purposes of this Section 3.1(h) the term
"material contracts" shall mean any  Parent Contract involving a value in
excess of $50,000 other than any  contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (i) with respect to the  service of any independent contractors
or consultants that are natural persons  entered into in the ordinary course
of business and (ii) with a content provider  entered into in the ordinary
course of business.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) _Benefit  Plans_. 

 

 

(i) Section  3.1(i) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list  of  each material Parent Benefit Plan. A " _Benefit  Plan_
" is  an  employee benefit plan including, without limitation, any
"employee benefit  plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act  of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "),  any 
multiemployer plan within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37)) and each stock 
purchase, stock option, severance, employment, change-in-control, fringe 
benefit, collective bargaining, bonus, incentive or deferred compensation 
plan,  agreement, program, policy or other arrangement, whether or not
subject to  ERISA. A " _Parent  Benefit Plan_ " is  any  Benefit Plan (x)
maintained, entered into or contributed to by Parent or  any of  its
Subsidiaries under which any present or former employee, director, 
independent contractor or consultant of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries 
has  any present or future right to benefits or (y) under which Parent or
any  of its  Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to have any present
or future  liability. No Parent Benefit Plan is subject to Section 302 or
Title IV of  ERISA  or Section 412 of the Code. No Parent Benefit Plan is a
multiemployer plan,  as  defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or a multiple
employer welfare arrangement  as  defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) With  respect to each material Parent Benefit Plan, Parent has made
available to  Company a current, accurate and complete copy thereof, and, to
the extent  applicable: (A) any related trust agreement or other funding
instrument;  (B) the  most recent determination letter, if applicable; (C)
any summary plan  description and summaries of material modifications; and
(D) the most recent  year's Form 5500 and attached schedules and audited
financial statements. Except  as would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on  Parent,  each Parent Benefit Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)  of the Code is so qualified

and  15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
required  to  be disclosed by Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the  Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time  periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and
is accumulated and  communicated to Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions  regarding required disclosure, and (B) has disclosed,
based on its most recent  evaluation of such disclosure controls and
procedures prior to the date hereof,  to Company's auditors and the audit
committee of Company's Board of Directors  (1) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or  operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which are reasonably  likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Company's ability to record,  process, summarize and report
financial information and (2) any fraud, whether  or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a  significant role in
Company's internal controls over financial  reporting.

(iv) There  are  no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
Company or any  Company Subsidiary to any executive officer (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under  the  Exchange Act) or director of Company. Company has not,
since the enactment  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, taken any action
prohibited by Section 402  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

 

 

(f) _Legal  Proceedings_.  Except  as set forth in Section 3.2(f) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there  is no  claim, suit, action, litigation,
arbitration, investigation or other demand  or  proceeding (whether
judicial, arbitral, administrative or other) pending  or, to  the knowledge
of Company, threatened, against or affecting Company or any  Subsidiary of
Company as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an  adverse outcome
which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material  adverse
effect on Company, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction,  rule, 
award, settlement, stipulation or order of or subject to any Governmental 
Entity  or arbitrator outstanding against Company or any Subsidiary of
Company. To  the  knowledge of Company, no investigation by any Governmental
Entity with respect  to Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or
threatened.

 

 

(g) _Taxes_.  Company  and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all material
tax returns required  to be  filed by any of them when due in accordance
with all applicable laws (and  each  such tax return is, or shall be at the
time of filing, true and complete  in all  material respects) and have paid
(or Company has paid on their behalf) all  taxes  shown as due on such
returns, and the most recent financial statements contained  in the Company
SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve, in accordance with  generally
accepted accounting principles, for all taxes payable by Company  and  its
Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such financial statements. No 
material deficiencies or other claims for any taxes have been proposed,
asserted  or assessed against Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are not
adequately  reserved for. There is no claim, audit or suit now pending or, to
the knowledge  of Company, threatened against or with respect to Company or
its Subsidiaries  in  respect of any federal or state income tax;
additionally, no claim or suit  regarding an amount of tax is now pending in
connection with (x) any other  tax  return or (y) circumstances where no tax
return has been filed. Neither Company  nor any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates has taken or agreed to take any  action  or knows of any fact,
agreement or plan or other circumstance that could  reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization  within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

(h) _Certain  Agreements_.  Except  as disclosed in or filed as exhibits to
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K  for the fiscal year ended November
30, 2006 or Company SEC Documents filed  subsequent to such Annual Report on
Form 10-K and prior to the date of this  Agreement and except for this
Agreement and as set forth on Section 3.2 (h)  of  the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries  is  a party to or
bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding  (i) with
respect to the service of any directors, officers, employees, involving  the
payment of $50,000 or more in any 12 month period, (ii) with respect  to
the  service of any independent contractors or consultants that are natural
persons  involving the payment of $50,000 or more in any 12 month period,
entered  into  other than in the ordinary course of business, (iii) which is
a "material  contract" (as such term is defined below), (iv) which limits the
ability of  Company or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of
business, in  any  geographic area or with any person,  or which requires
referrals of business and, in each case, which limitation  or  requirement
would reasonably be expected to be material to Company and its  Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, (v)  with  or to a labor union or guild (including any
collective bargaining agreement),  (vi) which is a contract, arrangement or
understanding entered into other  than  in the ordinary course of business,
with a content provider involving the  payment of $50,000 or more  in any 
12 month period or (vi) which would prevent, delay or impede the
consummation,  or otherwise reduce the contemplated benefits, of any of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. Company has previously made
available to  Parent  or its representatives complete and accurate copies of
each contract,  arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type
described in this Section  3.2(h) (collectively referred to herein as
"Company Contracts"). All of the  Company Contracts are valid and in full
force and effect, except to the extent  they have previously expired in
accordance with their terms. Neither Company  nor  any of its Subsidiaries
has, or is alleged to have, and to the knowledge  of  Company, none of the
other parties thereto have, violated any provision of,  or  committed or
failed to perform any act, and no event or condition exists,  which,  with
or without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default  under 
the provisions of, any Company Contract, except in each case for those 
violations and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not 
reasonably be expected to deprive  Company and its Subsidiaries in any
material respect of the benefits of such  Company Contracts subject to such
violations and defaults.  For  purposes of this Section 3.2(h), the term
"material contracts" shall mean any  Company Contract involving a value in
excess of $50,000 other  than any  contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (i) with respect to the  service of any independent contractors
or consultants that are natural persons  entered into in the ordinary course
of business and (ii) with a content provider  entered into in the ordinary
course of business.

 

 

(i) _Benefit  Plans_. 

 

 

(i) Section  3.2(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete  list of  each material Company Benefit Plan. A " _Company 
Benefit Plan_ " is  a  Benefit Plan (x) maintained, entered into or
contributed to by Company or  any of  its Subsidiaries under which any
present or former employee, director,  independent contractor or consultant
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries  has  any present or future right to
benefits or (y) under which Company or any  of its  Subsidiaries could
reasonably be expected to have any present or future  liability. No Company
Benefit Plan is subject to Section 302 or Title IV  of  ERISA of section 412
of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer  plan, as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA or a multiple employer welfare  arrangement as defined
in Section 3(40) of ERISA.

instrument;  (B) the  most recent determination letter, if applicable; (C)
any summary plan  description and summaries of material modifications; and
(D) the most recent  year's Form 5500 and attached schedules and audited
financial statements. Except  as would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on  Company, each Company Benefit Plan that is
intended to be qualified under  Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified
and the plan as currently in effect  has received a favorable determination
letter to that effect from the Internal  Revenue Service and Company is not
aware of any reason why any such  determination letter should be revoked or
not be reissued. Each Company Benefit  Plan has been maintained in compliance
with its terms and with the requirements  prescribed by any and all statutes,
orders, rules and regulations, including  ERISA and the Code, which are
applicable to such Company Benefit Plan with  such  exceptions as would not
be reasonable expected to have a material adverse  effect  on Company. No
events have occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan  that could
result in payment or assessment by or against Company or any Company  ERISA
Affiliate (as defined in paragraph (v) below) of any excise taxes under 
Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the 
Code  with such exceptions as would not be reasonably expected to have a
material  adverse effect on Company.

 

 

(iii) With  respect to the Company Benefit Plans, individually and in the
aggregate,  no  event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of
circumstances  in  connection with which Company or any of its Subsidiaries
could be subject  to any  liability that would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect  on  Company under ERISA, the Code or any
other applicable law.

 

 

(iv) There  is  no contract, plan or arrangement (whether or not written)
covering any employee  or former employee of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually  or  collectively, could give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not  be  deductible pursuant to the terms
of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code, as  a  result of the transactions
contemplated hereby alone or together with any  other  event.

 

 

(v) Except  as  would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on Company  or  any of its Subsidiaries, (A) no liability under Title
IV or section 302 of  ERISA  has been incurred by Company, or by any trade
or business, whether or not  incorporated, that together with Company would
be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of section 4001(b) of ERISA
(a " _Company  ERISA Affiliate_ "),  that  has not been satisfied in full,
and (B) no condition exists that presents  a risk  to Company or any Company
ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability. 

 

 

(vi) There  is  no current or projected liability in respect of post-
employment or  post-retirement health or medical or life insurance benefits
for retired,  former  or current employees of Company or its Subsidiaries,
except as required to  avoid  excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(vii) All  contributions and payments due under each Company Benefit Plan,
determined  in  accordance with prior funding and accrual practices, as
adjusted to include  proportional accruals for the period ending on the
Effective Time, will be  discharged and paid on or prior to the Effective
Time except to the extent  accrued as a liability in accordance with ordinary
Company  practice.

 

 

(j) _Subsidiaries_.  Section  3.2(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
lists  all the  Subsidiaries of Company which are Significant Subsidiaries.

organized, validly existing  and,  in the case of corporations, in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction  of formation, has all requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate  its properties and to carry on
its business as now being conducted, and is  duly  qualified and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which  the  nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes  such 
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure 
so  to qualify would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably  be  expected to have a material adverse effect on Company. All
of the shares  of  capital stock and all ownership interests and voting
securities of each of  the  Company Subsidiaries are owned by Company or by
another Company Subsidiary  free  and clear of any material claim, lien or
encumbrance, except for Company  Permitted Liens, and are fully paid and
nonassessable.

conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary course  consistent with

has been rendered inapplicable  to this  Agreement and the Merger), no
"moratorium," "control share," "fair price" or  other anti-takeover law or
regulation is applicable to this Agreement, the  Merger, or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

(a) (i) As  soon  as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent, Merger Co. and  Company shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause
to be filed with the  SEC  mutually acceptable proxy materials which shall

submitted to the Company  stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting
(as defined in Section 5.1(b))  and to the Parent stockholders at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting (as defined  in  Section 5.1(c)) (such joint proxy
statement/prospectus, and any amendments  or  supplements thereto, the "
_Joint  Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ").  As  soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare,  together with Company, and
file with the SEC a registration statement on  Form  S-4 (of which the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be a part) with  respect  to the issuance
of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (such Form S-4, and  any  amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Form  S-4_ "). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Each  of  Parent and Company shall use commercially reasonable best
efforts to have  the  Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC
and the Form S-4 declared  effective by the SEC, to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as is necessary  to  consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and  to  mail the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to their respective stockholders  as  promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective. Parent  and  Company
shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide  the  other
party with copies of any written comments and advise the other party  of 
any oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or 
Form  S-4 received from the SEC. Each party shall cooperate and provide the
other  party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment  or  supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Form S-4 prior  to  filing such with the SEC, and each party will provide
the other party with  a  copy of all such filings made with the SEC.

 

 

(iii) None  of  the information supplied or to be supplied by Company or
Parent for inclusion  or  incorporation by reference in the (A) Form S-4
will, at the time the Form  S-4 is  filed with the SEC and at the time it
becomes effective under the Securities  Act, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any  material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements  therein not misleading, and the
(B) Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will,  at  the date of mailing to
stockholders and at the times of the meetings of  stockholders to be held in
connection with the Merger, contain any untrue  statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required  to be  stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light  of  the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy 
Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with 
the  requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the
SEC  thereunder, except that no representation or warranty shall be made by
either  such party with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein  based on information supplied by the other party for
inclusion or incorporation  by reference in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4.

 

 

(iv) Company  and Parent shall make any necessary filings with respect to the
Merger under  the  Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.  Parent shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to take any action  required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection  with the Merger and each party shall furnish
all information concerning it  and  the holders of its capital stock as may
be reasonably requested in connection  with any such action.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(v) Each  party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives
notice thereof,  of  the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the
issuance of any stop  order,  the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in  connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or any  request by the SEC for amendment of the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus  or the  Form S-4. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating  to  either of the parties, or
their respective affiliates, officers or directors,  should be discovered by
either party which should be set forth in an amendment  or supplement to any
of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus  so  that such
documents would not include any misstatement of  a  material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the  statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made,  not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly  notify  the other party
hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations,  an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall  be 
promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of Company 
and  Parent.

 

 

(vi) Except  as  otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no amendment or
supplement (including  by  incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the  Form  S-4 shall be made without the approval of
Company and Parent, which approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; _provided_   that  Company, in connection with a Change in Company
Recommendation, and Parent,  in  connection with a Change in Parent
Recommendation, may amend or supplement  the  proxy statement for Company,
the proxy statement for Parent or the Form S-4  (including by incorporation
by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment  to  effect or reflect such
change, and in such event, the right of approval set  forth in this Section
5.1(a)(vi) shall not apply to such Qualifying Amendment;  _provided_   that
the  right of approval shall continue to apply with respect to such
information  relating to the other party or its business, financial condition
or results  of  operations, subject to the right of each party to have its
Board of Directors' deliberations and conclusions be accurately described. A
" _Qualifying  Amendment_ " means  an amendment or supplement to the proxy
statement for Company, the proxy  statement for Parent or the Form S-4
(including by incorporation by reference)  which effects or reflects a Change
in Company Recommendation or a Change  in  Parent Recommendation (as the
case may be); provided that any such amendment  or  supplement is limited to
(A) a Change in Company Recommendation or a Change  in  Parent
Recommendation (as the case may be), (B) a discussion of the reasons  of 
the Board of Directors of Company or Parent (as the case may be) for making 
such  Change in Company Recommendation or Change in Parent Recommendation (as
the  case  may be) and (C) background information regarding the Company
Board of Directors' or Parent Board of Directors' (as the case may be)

this Agreement shall be submitted to the  stockholders of Parent at the
Parent Stockholders Meeting for the purpose  of  approving the matters
comprising the Required Parent Vote and nothing contained  herein shall be
deemed to relieve Parent of such obligation.

 

 

(d) Company  and Parent shall each use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause  the  Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent
Stockholders Meeting to be held  on  the same date.

officers and, during such  period, each of Company and Parent shall (and
shall cause each of their  respective Subsidiaries to) make available to the
other such information  concerning its business, properties and personnel as
such other party may  reasonably request. Neither party nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required  to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure  would violate or prejudice the
rights of its customers, jeopardize the  attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of  such  information or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree  or  binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties  will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances  in 
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply, including adopting 
additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of certain 
sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable antitrust laws, 
and,  if necessary, restricting review of certain sensitive material to the
receiving  party's financial advisors or outside legal counsel.

 

 

(b) The  parties will hold any such information which is nonpublic in
confidence to  the  extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the letter  agreement, dated December 13, 2006, between Parent
and Company (the " _Confidentiality  Agreement_ "),  which 
Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

 

 

(c) No  such  investigation by either Parent or Company shall affect the
representations  and  warranties of the other.

 

 

5.3 Reasonable  Best Efforts.

 

 

(a) Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will
use its  commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions  and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable  under  this Agreement and applicable laws, rules and regulations
to consummate the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon  as  practicable after the date hereof, including
preparing and filing as promptly  as  practicable all documentation to
effect all necessary applications, notices,  filings and other documents and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all  Requisite Regulatory Approvals and
all other consents, waivers, orders,  approvals, permits, rulings,
authorizations and clearances necessary or  advisable to be obtained from any
third party or any Governmental Entity  in  order to consummate the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each  party hereto agrees
(A) to make, as promptly as practicable, to the extent  it  has not already
done so, an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report  Form  pursuant
to the HSR Act, if applicable, with respect to the transactions  contemplated
hereby (which filing, if applicable, shall be made in any event  within 15
business days of the date hereof) and (B) to supply as promptly  as 
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may 
be  requested pursuant to the HSR Act or by such authorities and to use
commercially  reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable  waiting periods under the HSR Act and the receipt of all
such consents, waivers,  orders, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations
and clearances under  any  other applicable antitrust laws or from such
authorities as soon as practicable. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing  in this Section 5.3 shall require, or be deemed to
require, (i) Parent or  Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to
take any action, agree  to  take any action or consent to the taking of any
action (including with respect  to selling, holding separate or otherwise
disposing of any business or assets  or  conducting its (or its
Subsidiaries') business in any specified manner) if doing  so would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result  in  a
material adverse effect on Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the 
Effective Time, or (ii) Parent or Company (or any of their respective 
Subsidiaries) to take any such action that is not conditioned on the 
consummation of the Merger. Neither party shall take or agree to take any 
action  identified in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence without
the prior  written consent of the other party, which  consent,  in the 
case of an action identified in clause (ii), shall  not  be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

 

 

(c) Each  of  Parent and Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section  5.3(a), use its commercially reasonable best efforts
to (i) cooperate in  all  respects with each other in connection with any
filing or submission and  in  connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding  initiated by a private party, (ii)
promptly inform the other party of the  status  of any of the matters
contemplated hereby, including providing the other  party  with a copy of
any written communication (or summary of oral communications)  received by
such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division  of the
Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or  any  other
Governmental Entity and of any written communication (or summary of  oral 
communications) received or given in connection with any proceeding by a 
private  party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby,  and  (iii) to the extent practicable, consult with each other in
advance of any  meeting or conference with any such Governmental Entity or,
in connection  with  any proceeding by a private party, with any such other
person, and to the  extent  permitted by any such Governmental Entity or
other person, give the other  party  the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences. 

 

 

(d) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained  in  this Section 5.3, if (i) any objections are asserted with
respect to the  transactions contemplated hereby under any law, rule,
regulation, order or  decree, (ii) any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted  (or threatened to be instituted) by any
Governmental Entity or private party  challenging the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby as  violative of any law, rule, regulation,
order or decree or which would otherwise  prevent, delay or impede the
consummation, or otherwise materially reduce  the  contemplated benefits, of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated  hereby, or (iii) any law,
rule, regulation, order or decree is enacted, entered,  promulgated or
enforced by a Governmental Entity which would make the Merger  or  the other
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise prevent,  delay
or impede the consummation, or otherwise materially reduce the  contemplated
benefits, of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated  hereby, then
each of Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable  best
efforts to resolve any such objections, actions or proceedings so as  to 
permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, 
including, subject to Section 5.3(b), selling, holding separate or otherwise 
disposing of or conducting its or its Subsidiaries' business or assets in a 
specified manner, or agreeing to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose  of
or  conduct its or its Subsidiaries' business or assets in a specified
manner, which  would resolve such objections, actions or proceedings.

(e) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained  in  this Section 5.3, but subject to first complying with the
obligations of  Section  5.3(d), if any of the events specified in Section
5.3(d)(ii) or (iii) occurs,  then each of Parent and Company shall cooperate
in all respects with each  other  and use its commercially reasonable best
efforts, subject to Section 5.3(b),  to  contest and resist any such
administrative or judicial action or proceeding  and  to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any judgment, injunction  or  other decree or
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that  is in  effect and
that prevents, materially delays or materially impedes the  consummation, or
otherwise materially reduces the contemplated benefits,  of the  Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have  such 
law, rule, regulation, order or decree repealed, rescinded or made
inapplicable  so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement,  and each of Parent and Company shall use its commercially
reasonable best  efforts to defend, at its own cost and expense, any such
administrative or  judicial actions or proceedings; _provided_ ,  _however_
,  that no  party shall be obligated to expend any effort or expense if it
receives an  opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the other party that
it is highly  unlikely that such effort will be successful. 

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding  the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section  5.3 shall limit a party's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section  7.1(b) or 7.1(c) so long as such party has
otherwise complied with its  obligations under this Section 5.3 prior to such
termination.

 

 

(g) Parent  shall agree to execute and deliver, at or prior to the Effective
Time,  supplemental indentures, loan amendments and other instruments
required for  the  due assumption, as determined by the parties hereto, of
Company's outstanding  debt, guarantees and other securities to the extent
required by the terms  of  such debt, guarantees and securities and the
instruments and agreements relating  thereto, and Company shall assist Parent
in accomplishing the same. 

 

 

(h) Each  of  Company and Parent and their respective Boards of Directors
shall, if any  "moratorium," "control share," "fair price" or other anti-
takeover law or  regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger,
or any other  transactions contemplated hereby, use its commercially
reasonable best efforts  to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms  contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such law or  regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated  hereby.

5.4 Acquisition  Proposals.

 

 

(a) Each  of  Parent and Company agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor  any of  the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall  use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney  or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly  or  indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate the  making  of any
proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, a merger, 
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, 
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving 
it  or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (other than any such transaction 
permitted by Section 4.1(e) or (f) in the case of Parent, and Section 4.2(f) 
in  the case of Company) or any purchase or sale of 25% or more of the
consolidated  assets (including, without limitation, stock of its
Subsidiaries) of it and  its  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any
purchase or sale of, or tender or  exchange offer for, its voting securities
that, if consummated, would result  in  any person (or the stockholders of
such person) beneficially owning securities  representing 25% **** or 
more  of its total voting power (or of the surviving parent entity in such 
transaction) (any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than a proposal 
or  offer made by the other party to this Agreement) being hereinafter
referred  to  as an " _Acquisition  Proposal_ "),  (ii)  have any
discussions with or provide any confidential information or data  to any 
person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations 
concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or 
attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve or 
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, 
any  letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset
purchase  or  share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement related  to  any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise approve,
endorse or recommend any  Acquisition Proposal, or propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing. 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, either party
to this Agreement  or  its respective Board of Directors shall be permitted
to (A) to the extent  applicable and being otherwise in compliance with this
Section 5.4(b), comply  with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard  to  an Acquisition Proposal, or make any
disclosure that the Board of Directors  may  determine (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) is required  to be  made under applicable
law, (B) effect a Change in Company Recommendation  or a  Change in Parent
Recommendation (as applicable, a " _Change  in_ _Recommendation_ "),  and 
(C) engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
confidential  information or data to, any person in response to an
unsolicited bona fide  written Acquisition Proposal by any such person first
made after the date  of  this Agreement, if and only to the extent that,

 

 

(i) in  any  such case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, (I) with
respect to Company,  the Required Company Vote has not been obtained or, with
respect to Parent,  the  Required Parent Vote has not been obtained, (II)
such party has complied  in all  material respects with this Section 5.4,
and (III) its Board of Directors,  after  consultation with its outside
legal counsel, determines in good faith that  failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties  under applicable law;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) in  the  case of clause (B) above, (I) there has been a development,
event or occurrence  after the date of this Agreement (an " _Occurrence_ ") 
as a  result of which the Board of Directors, after consultation with its
outside  legal counsel and financial advisors, determines in good faith that
failure  to  effect a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary  duties under applicable law, (II) it has notified the other
party to this  Agreement, at least three (3) business days in advance of a
date of its  consideration of a resolution to effect a Change in
Recommendation, and  furnished to the other party to this Agreement any
material information  possessed by it with respect to such Occurrence
(including, if the Occurrence  is  the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal
from a third party, the material terms  and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, the identity of the party making  such Acquisition Proposal and a
copy of any relevant proposed transaction  agreements with the party making
such Acquisition Proposal and any other  material documents received by it or
its representatives in connection  therewith), and (III) prior to effecting
such a Change in Recommendation,  it has  (together with its financial and
legal advisors) engaged in reasonable, good  faith negotiations with the
other party to this Agreement, and has considered  in  good faith, after
consulting with its financial and legal advisors, any  modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by the  other party hereto to
determine whether such modifications cause the Board  of  Directors to
conclude that such Occurrence no longer requires a Change in  Recommendation;
or

 

 

(iii) in  the  case of clause (C) above, its Board of Directors, after
consultation with  outside legal counsel and financial advisors, concludes in
good faith that  there  is a reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or  is  reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal, and prior to providing  any  information or data to any person in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal  by  any such person, its Board of
Directors receives from such person an executed  confidentiality agreement
having provisions that are no less favorable to  the  party providing such
information than those contained in the Confidentiality  Agreement;
_provided_   that the  provisions in such confidentiality agreement with
respect to treatment of  certain sensitive confidential information to ensure
compliance with applicable  antitrust laws may differ due to the nature of
the person or entity making  such  Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(c) Each  of  Parent and Company shall notify the other party to this
Agreement of any  Acquisition Proposal received by, any information related
to an Acquisition  Proposal requested from, or any discussions with or
negotiations by, it or  any  of its representatives, indicating, in
connection with such notice, the identity  of such person and the material
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition  Proposal or request for
information (including a copy thereof if in writing  and  any related
available documentation or correspondence), and in any event  each of 
Parent and Company shall provide written notice to the other party of any 
Acquisition Proposal, request for information or initiation of such
discussions  or negotiations within 48 hours of such event. Each of Parent
and Company  agrees  that it will promptly keep the other party informed of
the status and terms  of  any such Acquisition Proposal (including whether
withdrawn or rejected),  the  status and nature of all information requested
and delivered, and the status  and  terms of any such discussions or
negotiations, and in any event each of Parent  and Company shall provide the
other party with written notice of any material  development thereto within
48 hours thereof. Each of Parent and Company also  agrees to provide the
other party hereto with copies of any written information  that it provides
to the third party making the request therefor within 24  hours  of the time
it provides such information to such third party, unless the  other  party
hereto (i) has already been provided with such information or (ii)  is 
restricted from receiving such information to ensure compliance with
applicable  antitrust laws; _provided_   that in  such case, such party
shall inform the other party of the type of information  to  be provided to
the third party making the request.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Each  of  Parent and Company agrees that (i) it will and will cause its
Subsidiaries,  and  its and their officers, directors, agents,
representatives and advisors to,  cease immediately and terminate any and all
existing activities, discussions  or  negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to  any  Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) it
will not release any third party from,  or  waive any provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which  it  or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.  Each of
Parent and Company agrees that it will use commercially reasonable  best 
efforts to promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries' respective directors, 
executive officers and financial and legal advisors of the obligations 
undertaken in this Section 5.4. Each party shall, if it has not already done 
so,  promptly request, to the extent it has a contractual right to do so,
that  each  person, if any, that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement  within  the six months prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with its  consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to return or
destroy all confidential  information or data heretofore furnished to any
person by or on behalf of  it or  any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(e) Nothing  in this Section 5.4 shall (x) permit either party to terminate
this Agreement  or  (y) affect any other obligation of the parties under
this Agreement. Neither  party shall submit to the vote of its stockholders
any Acquisition Proposal  other than the Merger prior to the termination of
this Agreement.

 

 

(f) For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior  Proposal_ " means  a 
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of
Parent  or  Company, as the case may be, concludes in good faith, after
consultation  with  its financial advisors and legal advisors, taking into
account the legal,  financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the
proposal and the person  making the proposal (including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement  provisions and conditions  to consummation): (i) is
more favorable to the stockholders of Parent or  Company, as the case may be,
than the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement (after giving effect to
any adjustments to the terms and provisions  of  this Agreement committed to
in writing by Parent or Company, as the case  may be,  in response to such
Acquisition Proposal) and (ii) is fully financed or  reasonably capable of
being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive  all  required
governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably  capable of
being completed on the terms proposed; _provided_   that,  for purposes of
this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition  Proposal shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.4(a),  except  that the
reference to "15% or more" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall
be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall
only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving Parent or Company,  as 
the case may be.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52

vesting or payment  under any Converted Equity Award, to be approved for
listing on NASDAQ, subject  to official notice of issuance, prior to the

Company Benefit Plans in effect  at the  date of this Agreement shall remain
in effect after the Effective Time with  respect to employees covered by such
plans at the Effective Time for a period  of  time to be determined by the
Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation,  and the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to formulate Benefit Plans  for  Parent and its
Subsidiaries that, following the formulation of such Benefit  Plans, shall
provide benefits for services on a substantially similar basis,  in  the
aggregate, to employees who were covered by the Parent Benefit Plans  and 
Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. Within forty-
five  (45) days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration
statement  on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) relating to shares of
Parent Common  Stock underlying Converted Options (if any) described in
Section 2.5 hereof.

Effective Time adopt a resolution  or  resolutions providing that the
receipt by the Insiders (as defined below)  of  Parent Common Stock in

transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such  securities are
listed in the Section 16 Information provided by Company to  Parent prior to
the Effective Time, is intended to be exempt from liability  pursuant to

exempt. " _Section  16 Information_ " shall  mean information accurate in
all material respects regarding the Insiders,  the  number of shares of the
capital stock held by each such Insider, and the  number  and description of
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares  and  other stock-
based awards held by each such Insider. " _Insiders_ " shall  mean those

the  Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Surviving
Corporation (and/or Parent, if applicable) shall not be obligated  to make

8.3 Interpretation.

 

 

When  a  reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or
Schedules, such  reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to
this Agreement  unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings contained  in this  Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way  the  meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be  followed by the words "without
limitation".

 

 

The  phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that the
information  referred to has been made available by the party to whom such
information  is to  be made available. The phrases "herein," "hereof,"
"hereunder" and words of  similar import shall be deemed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole, including  the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and not
to any particular provision of  this  Agreement. The word "or" shall be
inclusive and not exclusive. Any pronoun shall  include the corresponding
masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The phrases  "known" or "knowledge"
mean, with respect to either party to this Agreement, the  actual knowledge
of such party's executive officers. The term "affiliate" has  the meaning
given to it in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and the term "person" has the
meaning given to it in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange  Act.

 

 

8.4 Counterparts.

 

 

This  Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
considered  one  and the same agreement and this Agreement shall become
effective when such  counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the  other  parties, it being understood that the parties need
not sign the same  counterpart.

 

 

8.5 Entire  Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

 

 

This  Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to
herein)  (a)  constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and  understandings, both written and oral, between the parties
with respect to  the  subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall  survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and (b) except as provided  in Section 5.11 (which is intended for the
benefit of only the persons specified  therein), is not intended to confer
upon any person other than the parties  hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

 

 

8.6 Governing  Law.

 

 

This  Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws  of  the State of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law
principles  thereof).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

67  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.7 Severability.

 

 

Any  term  or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable
in any  jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent  of  such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless the effect of
such invalidity  or  unenforceability would prevent the parties from
realizing the major portion  of  the economic benefits of the Merger that
they currently anticipate obtaining  therefrom, shall not render invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms  and  provisions of this Agreement or
affect the validity or enforceability of  any of  the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any  provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision  shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

 

 

8.8 Assignment.

 

 

Neither  this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of
the parties  hereunder shall be assigned by either of the parties hereto
(whether by  operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other  party, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such
consent shall  be  null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be  binding  upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the parties and their  respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

 

8.9 Submission  to Jurisdiction.

 

 

Each  party hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any federal
court  located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court for the
purposes  of  any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or any  transaction contemplated hereby. Each party hereto agrees
to commence any  action, suit or proceeding relating hereto either in any
federal court located  in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court.
Each party hereto  irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to
the laying of venue  of  any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware  or any  Delaware state court, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally  waives  and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such action,  suit or  proceeding brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient  forum.  Each party
hereto further irrevocably consents to the service of process  out of  any
of the aforementioned courts in any such suit, action or other proceeding 
by  the mailing of copies thereof by mail to such party at its address set
forth  in  this Agreement, such service of process to be effective upon
acknowledgment  of  receipt of such registered mail; provided that nothing
in this Section 8.9  shall  affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner  permitted by law. The consent to jurisdiction
set forth in this Section 8.9  shall not constitute a general consent to
service of process in the State  of  Delaware and shall have no effect for
any purpose except as provided in this  Section. The parties hereto agree
that a final judgment in any such suit,  action  or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions  by  suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

8.10 Enforcement.

 

 

The  parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of  the  provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their  specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly  agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
other equitable  relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically  the  terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
identified in the Section  above, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled  at  law or in equity.

 

 

8.11 WAIVER  OF  JURY TRIAL.

 

 

EACH  OF  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING
INVOLVING,  DIRECTLY, IN ANY MATTERS (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR
OTHERWISE)  IN  ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH, THIS
AGREEMENT OR  THE  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
