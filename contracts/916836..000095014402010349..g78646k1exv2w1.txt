Diversified Realty Corporation, an Ohio corporation ("PARENT"), and DDR
Transitory Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and subsidiary of Parent
("MERGER Sub").   W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors
of the Company has unanimously determined that the merger of the Merger Sub

fair to, and in the best interests of the Company and the holders of the
common stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share (the "COMPANY COMMON
STOCK");   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has unanimously
determined that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable and fair to, and
in the best interests of, Parent and the holders of common shares, without
par value, of Parent (the "PARENT COMMON STOCK");   WHEREAS, the Board of
Directors of Merger Sub has unanimously determined that the Merger and this
Agreement are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Merger Sub
and its sole stockholder;   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to action taken by unanimous written consent in accordance
with the requirements of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL")
and the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Merger Sub;   WHEREAS, for
federal income tax purposes it is intended by the parties hereto that the
Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section

Agreement and in accordance with the MGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with

governed by the laws of the State of Maryland.   Section 1.2 EFFECTIVE
TIME. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing such articles of

Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time specified in the
Articles of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the

specified by the parties (the "CLOSING DATE"), which shall be no later than
the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set

be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions), at the offices of Willkie, Farr and Gallagher, 787 Seventh
Avenue, New York, New York 10019, or at such other time, date or place as
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.   Section 1.4 EFFECTS OF THE
MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the MGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving
Corporation.   Section 1.5 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. The
articles of incorporation of the Company in effect at the Effective Time (the
"ARTICLES") shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended. The Bylaws of Company in effect at the
Effective Time (the "BYLAWS") shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended.   Section 1.6 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
OF SURVIVING CORPORATION.    (a) The directors of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation, to
hold office in accordance with the Articles and Bylaws of the    
-2-   Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal.   (b) The officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall become
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time,
to hold office in accordance with the Articles and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.   (c)
Resignations will be tendered for all current directors and officers of the
Company effective upon the Effective Time.   Section 1.7 DIRECTORS OF
PARENT. Parent shall cause (i) the Nominating Committee of Parent\'s Board of
Directors (the "PARENT BOARD") to nominate one of the persons set forth in
Section 1.7 to the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "NOMINEE"), for election
to Parent\'s Board of Directors effective as of, and conditional on, the
Effective Time of the Merger, (ii) such election of the Nominee to be voted
on by Parent\'s stockholders at the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting (as defined
herein) and (iii) the Nominating Committee of the Parent Board to nominate
the Nominee for election to the Parent Board at the 2003 annual meeting of
Parent\'s stockholders.   ARTICLE II.   MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION
OF STOCK   Section 2.1 CONVERSION OF COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder thereof:   (a) (i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b), if any) shall be canceled and shall by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof
be converted automatically into the right to receive 0.518 of a fully paid
and nonassessable share (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) each share of the Company\'s Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK"), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b), if any) shall be canceled and shall by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof
be converted automatically into the right to receive one fully paid and
nonassessable share of Parent cumulative redeemable voting preferred stock,
without par value (the "PARENT VOTING PREFERRED STOCK"). Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Parent shall be amended
in accordance with Ohio law in order to create the Parent Voting Preferred
Stock, which will have the same terms and rights as the Company Preferred
Stock, including with respect to distribution and rights upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, except that each share of the Parent Voting
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote on all matters that
holders of Parent Common Stock shall be entitled to vote on, but
shall otherwise be pari passu with all Parent Preferred Stock as to
distributions and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Except
as otherwise required by Law, the holders of Parent Voting Preferred Stock
shall vote together with the holders of Parent Common Stock as a single
class. The shares of     -3-   Parent Common Stock and Parent Voting
Preferred Stock that will be issued in the Merger are referred to herein as
the "MERGER CONSIDERATION".   (b) Each share of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock (collectively, "COMPANY STOCK") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by the
Company as treasury stock shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist
and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.   (c) At
the Effective Time, all shares of the Company Stock converted pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
("CERTIFICATE") representing any such shares of Company Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a).   (d) Each share of common
stock, without par value per share, and each share of preferred stock,
without par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value
per share, and preferred stock, without par value per share, respectively, of
the Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.    (a)
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust
company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent in
the Merger (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"). At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
holders of shares of the Company Stock, the Merger Consideration issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Stock
in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.1. Parent agrees to make available to the
Exchange Agent from time to time, as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.4.   (b) At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of the Company Stock on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates representing ownership of the Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with
respect to such Company Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein. The
shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Voting Preferred Stock issuable in
the Merger shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Time. On or
after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or
Parent for any reason shall be converted into the applicable
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Stock formerly
represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and
any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.4 without interest.   (c) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to     -4-   the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as the Company may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) shares of Parent Common
Stock or Parent Voting Preferred Stock, as the case may be, representing, in
the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1, and (B) a check in the amount equal to the
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
applicable Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to Section 2.4 (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings from cash payments), and in each case the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to this Article II,
including cash payable pursuant to Section 2.4 or Section 2.5.   (d) If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and the agreement by such Person to provide an indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the

The Merger is intended to be a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to be
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of the regulations promulgated
under Section 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E) of the Code and for the purpose of
qualifying as a tax-free transaction for federal income tax purposes. The
parties hereto agree to report the Merger as a tax-free reorganization under
the provisions of Section 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E) of the Code. None of the
parties hereto will take or cause to be taken any action, or omit to take any

from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E)
of the Code.   Section 2.4 DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares

Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent
Voting Preferred Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.5 until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of
shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Voting Preferred Stock issuable in
exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after     -5-   the

pursuant to Section 2.5 and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Voting Preferred Stock,
and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Voting Preferred
Stock.   Section 2.5 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK.   (a) No
certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder
of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock.   (b)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
shall receive from Parent, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in
an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of
applicable Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the average per share
closing price of Parent Common Stock quoted on the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE") for the ten (10) trading days ending two (2) business days prior

Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration, any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto or any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of applicable Parent Common Stock, in each case delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to two (2)
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any Merger Consideration, any dividends or distributions payable to the
holder of such Certificate or any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Article II, would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as hereinafter
defined)), any such Merger Consideration, dividends or distributions in
respect thereof or such cash shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent only as general
creditors thereof for satisfaction of their claims for the payment of such
Merger Consideration, dividends or distributions in respect thereof or such
cash (without any interest thereon).   Section 2.7 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. The
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of     -6-   this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.8 DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS.
No dissenters\' or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the
Merger.   Section 2.9 ADJUSTMENT OF EXCHANGE RATIO. In the event that,
subsequent to this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the shares of

reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar change in the capitalization of Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, increase or decrease in number or be changed into or exchanged for a
different kind or number of securities, then an appropriate and proportionate

any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, any other party, on the other hand, is in monetary default under any
Company Space Lease, except for defaults that are disclosed in the rent rolls

Disclosure Schedule, all work required to be performed, payments required to
be made and actions required to be taken prior to the date hereof pursuant to

similar action relating to any Operating Properties (e.g., local improvement

errors or omissions in the Development Budgets such that the contemplated
development, rehabilitation, renovation, addition or expansion of such
Development Property cannot be completed substantially in accordance with the
cost estimates set forth in the Development Budget (it being expressly
understood and agreed that such Development Budget was prepared solely on the
basis of estimates and assumptions of the Company at the time the Development
Budget was prepared and that the completion of any Development Property is
subject to numerous risks and uncertainties customarily associated with real
estate and development activities, including, without limitation, risks
inherent in completing construction projects, adverse governmental actions or

been evidenced by a written document as described in Section 3.11(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.   (j) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(j) of

in whatsoever (whether characterized as a contingent fee, profits interest,
equity interest or otherwise) or have the right to any of the foregoing in
any proposed or anticipated investment opportunity, joint
venture, partnership or any other current or future transaction or property
in which the Company or any subsidiary has or will have an interest,
including but not limited to those transactions or properties identified,
sourced, produced or developed by such Participation Party (a "PARTICIPATION

to contribute to a multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA
(a "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN"). Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred any material present or contingent liability under Title IV of
ERISA, nor does any condition exist which could reasonably be likely to
result in any such liability.   (b) Correct and complete copies of the
following documents, with respect to each of the Company Employee Benefit

not yet due will have been paid or accrued prior to the Effective Time and

the Company Employee Benefit Plans which is intended to be "qualified" within
the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter
from the IRS to the effect that such plan is "qualified" and that the trusts
maintained pursuant thereto are exempt from federal income taxation under
Section 501 of the Code. The Company knows of no fact which would adversely
affect the qualified status of any such Company Employee Benefit Plan or the
exemption of such trust.   (f) None of the Employee Benefit Plans provide

Disclosure Schedule, no stock or other security issued by the Company forms
or has formed a material part of the assets of any Company Employee Benefit
Plan.   (h) Except as specifically identified and quantified in Section
3.12(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and

its subsidiaries; (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable
under any Company Employee Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any such material benefits; or (iv) result
in any payment that will not be deductible for federal tax purposes under

identified in Section 3.12(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no "leased
employee" as that term is defined in Section 414(n) of the Code, performs
services for the Company. No leased employee is eligible to participate in
any Company Employee Benefit Plan at the exclusion of any such person who
does not cause any such plan to lose qualification under Section 401(a) of
the Code, nor does it violate the terms of any company Employee Benefit
Plan.   (j) All awards and grants made under the Company\'s Long-Term
Incentive Plan have vested.   Section 3.13 LABOR MATTERS.   (a) Section

The businesses of Parent and each of its subsidiaries are not being conducted
in violation of any Law applicable to Parent or its subsidiaries, except as
would not have or would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To Parent\'s knowledge,
no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Company or its subsidiaries is pending or threatened in writing, nor, to
Parent\'s knowledge, has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to
conduct the same.   Section 4.10 PROPERTIES.   (a) Except as set forth in
Section 4.10(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 of Parent includes a correct and
complete list and location of all material real property owned or leased by
Parent and its subsidiaries or otherwise used by Parent and its subsidiaries
in the conduct of their businesses or operations as of the date of this
Agreement (collectively, and together with the land at each location and all
buildings, structures and other improvements and fixtures located on or under
such land and all easements, rights and other appurtenances to such land, the
"PARENT PROPERTIES"). Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports filed
prior to the date of this Agreement, each of the Parent Properties is owned
or leased by Parent and its subsidiaries. Parent and its subsidiaries own or
lease each of the Parent Properties, in each case free and clear of
any Property Restrictions, except for (i) Permitted Liens, (ii)
Property Restrictions imposed or promulgated by Law or by any Governmental
Entity which are customary and typical for similar properties or (iii)
Property Restrictions which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
interfere materially with the current use of such property. To Parent\'s
knowledge, none of the matters described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above
would have or would reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (b) Parent and each of
its subsidiaries have good and sufficient title to all the material personal
and non-real properties and assets reflected in their books and records as
being owned by them (including those reflected in the consolidated balance
sheet of Parent and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, except as since
sold or otherwise disposed of in the usual, regular and ordinary course of
business), free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens.   (c)
Each of the tenant leases of Parent or its subsidiaries constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of Parent or its subsidiaries, enforceable
against Parent or its subsidiaries, as     -33-   the case may be, in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors\' rights or by general equity principles, and except as would not
have or would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. To Parent\'s knowledge, there is no violation or default (nor does
there exist any condition, which upon the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both, would cause such a violation or default by Parent) under any
such tenant lease, except for such violations or defaults that would not
have, or would not reasonably be likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent   Section 4.11 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed on Section
4.11 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and except for conditions that would
not have or would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, to the knowledge of Parent,
(i) Parent and its subsidiaries and all real property owned by Parent and its
subsidiaries are in compliance with Environmental Laws; (ii) Parent and its
subsidiaries have obtained and currently possess and maintain all permits
required by Environmental Laws (collectively, "PARENT ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS")
for each of their respective operations, all such Environmental Permits are
in good standing, and Parent and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the
terms and conditions of such Parent Environmental Permits; and (iii) neither
Parent and its subsidiaries nor any real property currently owned by Parent
or its subsidiaries is subject to any pending Environmental Claim as to which
Parent has been provided written notice.   Section 4.12 TAX MATTERS.  
(a) Each of Parent and American Industrial Properties REIT ("AIP") (i) has
been taxable as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and
has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for, in the case of
Parent, all taxable years commencing with Parent\'s initial REIT taxable year
ended December 31, 1993, through December 31, 2001, and in the case of AIP,
its taxable year ended December 31, 2001, (ii) has operated to the date of
this Agreement and intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to
qualify as a REIT for the taxable year December 31, 2002, and (iii) has not
taken or failed to take any action which would reasonably be likely to result
in a challenge to its status as a REIT, and, to Parent\'s knowledge, no such
challenge is pending or threatened in writing. Except as set forth in Section
4.12(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, each subsidiary of Parent or AIP
that is a partnership, joint venture, or limited liability company (i) has
been since its formation and continues to be treated for federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not
as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not
since the later of its formation or the acquisition by Parent or AIP of a
direct or indirect interest therein, owned any assets (including, without
limitation, securities) that would cause Parent or AIP to violate Section
856(c)(4) of the Code. Each subsidiary of Parent and AIP that is a
corporation has been since its formation a "qualified REIT subsidiary"
pursuant to Section 856(i) of the Code or a "taxable REIT subsidiary"
pursuant to Section 856(l) of the Code. Neither Parent, AIP nor any of their
subsidiaries holds any asset (i) the disposition of which would be subject to
rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an election under
IRS Notice 88-19 or Temporary Treas. Regs. ss.ss. 1.337(d)-5T and 337(d)-6T
or (ii) which is subject to a consent filed pursuant to section 341(f) of the
Code and the regulations thereunder.     -34-    (b) Since January 1,
2001, Parent and AIP have incurred no liability for excise taxes under
Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including without limitation any
excise tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section
857(b)(6) of the Code or any tax arising from "redetermined rents,
redetermined deductions and excess interest" described in Section 857(b)(7)
of the Code, and neither Parent, AIP nor any of their subsidiaries
has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the usual,
regular and ordinary course of business. No event has occurred and no
condition or circumstance exists which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding sentence will be imposed upon Parent,
AIP or any of their subsidiaries.   (c) Parent has made available to the
Company correct and complete copies of (A) all federal and other material Tax
Returns of Parent, AIP and its subsidiaries relating to the taxable periods
ending since December 31, 1998 which have been filed and (B) any audit report
issued within the last five years relating to any material Taxes due from or
with respect to Parent, AIP or any of their subsidiaries.   (d) Except as
set forth in Section 4.12(d), neither Parent nor AIP, or any of their
respective subsidiaries has requested any private letter ruling from the IRS
or comparable rulings from other taxing authorities which are currently
pending.   Section 4.13 NO LIQUIDATION. Parent has no present plan or
intention to merge or liquidate Company into Parent, or into an entity that
is a disregarded entity of Parent for federal income tax purposes, or to
cause the Company to become a "qualified REIT subsidiary" under Section
856(i) of the Code or any other disregarded entity.   Section 4.14 OPINION
OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. Goldman, Sachs and Co. (the "PARENT FINANCIAL ADVISOR")
has delivered to the Parent Board its opinion, dated the date of this
Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the Exchange Ratio is fair,
from a financial point of view, to Parent.   Section 4.15 BROKERS. No
broker, finder or investment banker (other than the Parent Financial Advisor,
a correct and complete copy of whose engagement agreement has been made
available to the Company) is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s or other
fee or commission in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made
by and on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their subsidiaries.  
Section 4.16 TAKEOVER STATUTES. Each of Parent and Merger Sub have taken all
action required to be taken in order to exempt this Agreement and the Merger
from, and this Agreement and the Merger are exempt from Takeover Statutes,
including the Ohio Control Share Acquisition Act, Ohio Business Combination
Act, Maryland Business Combination Act and Maryland Control Share Acquisition
Act, or any takeover provision in Parent\'s articles of incorporation and
bylaws.   Section 4.17 NO PRIOR ACTIVITIES; INTERIM OPERATIONS. Prior to the
date hereof, except for obligations incurred in connection with its
incorporation or organization or the negotiation and consummation of this
Agreement and the Merger, Merger Sub has neither incurred any obligation or
liability nor engaged in any business or activity of any type or kind
whatsoever or     -35-   entered into any agreement or arrangement with

records of Parent and its subsidiaries and (ii) permit such inspections as

designated representatives, in accordance with such reasonable procedures as
they may establish.   (b) Each of the parties hereto will cooperate with the
other during the period from the date hereof to the earlier of the date on
which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 and the Effective

maintain and enhance their respective relationships with tenants, suppliers
and others having business dealings with it.     -42-    (c) Each of
the parties hereto will hold and will cause its authorized representatives to
hold in confidence all documents and information concerning the Company, its

Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or
comments thereon and     -43-   responses thereto or requests by the
SEC for additional information. Neither the Company nor Parent shall change
or otherwise take any action after the mailing of such party\'s Proxy
Statement to its stockholders that would result in a change of the date
specified in such party\'s Proxy Statement for such party\'s Stockholders\'
Meeting (as hereinafter defined).   (c) None of the information supplied by
each of the Company and Parent for inclusion in the Registration Statement
(including by incorporation by reference) shall, (i) when filed with the SEC
or other regulatory agency, (ii) when it is declared effective, and (iii) at
the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit

their respective subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors,
should be discovered by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, which,
pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth in an
amendment or a supplement to the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement,
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other
party hereto. All documents that each of the Company or Parent is responsible

Act and the Exchange Act.   Section 6.2 STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETINGS. Parent
shall call and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "PARENT STOCKHOLDERS\'
MEETING") and the Company shall call and hold a meeting of its stockholders
(the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING," and collectively, the "STOCKHOLDERS\'

Registration Statement becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon the

reasonable best efforts to hold the Stockholders\' Meetings on the same day.

stockholders required by applicable Law and such party\'s articles of
incorporation or bylaws to effect the Merger. If required, Parent agrees to
take all actions necessary or advisable to authorize and create the Parent

of incorporation and obtaining the approval of its stockholders in connection
therewith.   Section 6.3 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.     -44-    (a)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party hereto will
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith,
all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws and regulations
to consummate the Merger and to cause to be satisfied all conditions
precedent to its obligations under this Agreement, in each case as soon as

to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any

reasonable best efforts to cooperate in all respects with each other in

the efforts referenced in Section 6.3(a) to obtain all Required Approvals,
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) subject to applicable Law, permit the
other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other in connection with, any proposed written or material oral
communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) between it and any
Governmental Entity, and (ii) promptly inform each other of and supply to
such other party any communication (or other correspondence or memoranda)
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the DOJ, the FTC or
any other Governmental Entity, in each case regarding the Merger contemplated
hereby.   (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of
the parties contained in this Section 6.3, if any objections are asserted
with respect to the Merger contemplated hereby under any antitrust or
competition Law, each of Parent and the Company agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts (which under no circumstances shall involve divesting of
material assets) to resolve any antitrust concerns, federal, state, foreign
or private, obtain all Required Approvals and obtain termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law and the
termination of any outstanding judicial or administrative orders prohibiting
the Closing so as to permit consummation of the Merger as soon as

a private party, is instituted (or threatened in writing to be
instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any Law or regulation, or if any statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order is enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Entity that would make the

preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement, and to
have such statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or
administrative order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit
consummation of the Merger.   Section 6.4 COMPANY ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.  
(a) From the date hereof until the termination hereof and except as permitted
by the following provisions of this Section 6.4, the Company will not, nor
will it permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor will it permit any
officer, director, employee or agent of, or any investment banker, attorney,
accountant or other advisor or representative of, the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage (including by furnishing nonpublic information) any inquiries or
the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations in furtherance of such
inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal, or the making of any proposal
that constitutes any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) agree to, approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that subject to the
Company\'s compliance with this Section 6.4, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board, prior to receipt of
the approval by the stockholders of the Company of the Merger, from (A)
entering into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a
Superior Proposal (as defined below) if the Company or the Company Board has
complied with the procedures of this Section 6.4 and is simultaneously
terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), or (B) furnishing
information to (subject to a confidentiality agreement at least
as restrictive as the Confidentiality Agreement in all material respects),
or entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any
Person that makes an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to
the Company if (1) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with independent outside counsel, that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders imposed by Law, (2)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
independent financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal would be
reasonably likely, if consummated, to constitute a Superior Proposal (as
hereinafter defined) and (3) prior to taking such action, the Company
complies with the procedures set forth in this Section 6.4. The Company shall
(i) promptly, and in any event within two (2) days, notify Parent orally and
in writing after receipt by the Company (or its advisors) of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiries indicating that any Person is reasonably likely to
make an Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions
thereof and the identity of the Person making it, (ii) promptly, and in any
event within two (2) days, notify Parent orally and in writing after receipt
of any request for non-public information relating to it or any of its
subsidiaries or for access to its or any of its subsidiaries\' properties,
books or records by any Person that, to the Company\'s knowledge,
is reasonably likely to, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, and (iii)
keep Parent advised on a prompt basis of any material change in the financial
terms or structure of any such Acquisition Proposal. Immediately after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will, and will instruct
its subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other agents to, cease and
terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition
Proposal.     -46-    The Company Board will not withdraw or modify, or
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger, and will not approve or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal, unless in connection with a Superior
Proposal which is pending at the time the Company determines to take such
action (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with independent outside counsel, that to do otherwise would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to stockholders imposed by Law, (ii) the Company
provides Parent with notice of its decision to withdraw or modify its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger, and (iii) during
the three (3) business day period after the Company\'s notice, (A) the
Company shall have offered to negotiate with, and, if accepted, negotiated in
good faith with, Parent to attempt to make such commercially reasonable
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company to proceed with the Merger and (B) the Company Board shall have
concluded, after considering the results of such negotiations and the revised
proposals made by the Parent, if any, that any Acquisition Proposal continues
to be a Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which
(i) in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, is reasonably likely to
be consummated, and (ii) a majority of the Company Board determines in their
good faith judgment after consultation with independent financial advisors to
be more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of
view (which determination may take into account legal and regulatory matters)
than the Merger.   (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company or the Company Board from (i) referring any Person or entity to
this Section 6.4, or (ii) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders
which, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, the failure to make would be inconsistent with
its obligations under applicable Law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that except as
otherwise permitted in Section 6.4(b), the Company does not withdraw or
modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to the
Merger or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal.   Section 6.5 PARENT BOARD APPROVAL AND
RECOMMENDATION. The Parent Board will not withdraw or modify, or propose to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger.   Section 6.6 RESIGNATIONS.
Upon the written request of Parent, (i) the Company shall cause any or all of
the directors (or persons occupying similar positions in any limited
liability company or other entity) and/or officers of each direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary to resign or be removed or, as to officers, to resign
or be terminated, effective as of the Closing, and (ii) if the Company or any
of its affiliated entities has the right to appoint any director (or person
occupying a similar position in any limited liability company or other
entity) or to cause the resignation or termination of any officer of any
other entity in which the Company (directly or indirectly) owns an equity
interest, the Company shall cause, effective as of the Closing, such director
to resign or to be removed and/or such officer to resign or
be terminated.   Section 6.7 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Parent and the Company
will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any     -47-   press release
or other written public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any rule
or regulation of the NYSE, or other similar exchange. The parties agree that
the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be in the form agreed to by the parties
hereto prior to the execution of this Agreement.   Section 6.8
INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INSURANCE.   (a) From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
present or former officer or director of the Company or any Company
subsidiary and any person who becomes an officer or director of the Company
or any Company subsidiary after the date hereof but prior to the Effective
Time, other than those officers or directors set forth in Section 6.8 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and, collectively,
the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), to the same extent as such officers or directors
are entitled to indemnification under the Company\'s articles
of incorporation, bylaws, employment agreements or indemnification contracts
as in effect on the date hereof in respect of actions or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including without limitation the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Each employment agreement and
indemnification agreement referred to in the preceding sentence either (i)
has been provided to Parent prior to the date hereof or (ii) contains
indemnification provisions substantially in the form contained in an
employment agreement or an indemnification agreement, as the case may be,
provided to Parent prior to the date hereof.   (b) Any Indemnified Parties
proposing to assert the right to be indemnified under Section 6.8(a) shall,
promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such
Indemnified Parties in respect of which a claim is to be made under Section
6.8(a) against Parent, notify Parent of the commencement of such action,
enclosing a copy of all papers served; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to
so notify Parent shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have
under Section 6.8(a) unless Parent is materially prejudiced thereby. If any
such action is brought against any of the Indemnified Parties and such
Indemnified Parties notify Parent of its commencement, Parent will be
entitled to participate in and, to the extent that Parent elects
by delivering written notice to such Indemnified Parties promptly after
receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the Indemnified
Parties, to assume the defense of the action with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties after notice from Parent to the
Indemnified Parties of its election to assume the defense, Parent will not be
liable to the Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses except as
provided below. If Parent assumes the defense, Parent shall have the right to
settle such action without the consent of the Indemnified Parties; provided,
however, that Parent shall be required to obtain such consent if the
settlement includes any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnified Parties or any decree or restriction on the Indemnified Parties;
provided, further, that Parent, in the defense of any such action shall not,
except with the consent of the Indemnified Parties (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Parties of a release from
all liability with respect to such action. The Indemnified Parties will have
the right to employ their own counsel in any such action, but   
-48-   the fees, expenses or other charges of such counsel will be at the
expense of such Indemnified Parties unless (i) the employment of counsel by
the Indemnified Parties has been authorized in writing by Parent, (ii) a
conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the Indemnified Parties)
between the Indemnified Parties and Parent (in which case Parent will not
have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the
Indemnified Parties) or (iii) Parent has not in fact employed counsel to
assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving
notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the
reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of one additional counsel
(representing all of the Indemnified Parties) will be at the expense
of Parent and shall be paid by Parent in a timely manner as statements
therefor are received (regardless of whether received prior to or after final
disposition of the claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation). Parent
shall not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected
without its written consent.   (c) Parent shall obtain and maintain in
effect at the Effective Time and continuing until the sixth anniversary
thereof "run-off" director and officer liability coverage with a coverage
amount and other terms and conditions in all material respects no less
favorable to the Indemnified Parties than under the Company\'s current
directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the directors and
officers of the Company with respect to their service as such prior to the
Effective Time.   (d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the
obligations set for in this Section 6.8.   (e) The provisions of this
Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives.   Section 6.9 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.   (a) BENEFIT PLANS.
After the Effective Time, all employees of the Company who are employed by
Parent or its subsidiaries shall, at the option of Parent, either continue to
be eligible to participate in an "employee benefit plan", as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA (an "EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN"), of the Company which is,
at the option of Parent, continued by Parent, or alternatively shall be
eligible to participate in the same manner as other similarly
situated employees of Parent in any Employee Benefit Plan, sponsored or
maintained by Parent after the Effective Time. With respect to each such
Employee Benefit Plan of Parent, service with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and the predecessor of any of them shall be included for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting (if applicable)
and determination of the level of entitlement to, benefits under such
Employee Benefit Plan. Parent shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries to, (i)
waive all limitations, as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
all employees of the Company who are employed by Parent under any welfare
plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained for such employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each such employee
of the Company who is employed by Parent with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the     -49-   Effective Time for the plan
year within which the Effective Time occurs in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such
employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time.   (b)
STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK PLANS. The Company shall take all actions
required to ensure that the stock option plans or programs of the Company and
the restricted stock plans or programs of the Company shall be terminated as
of the Effective Time.   (c) COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS. The Company shall take
all actions necessary and appropriate, including, without limitation,
obtaining all necessary consents, if any, to provide that all outstanding
Company Stock Options shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and that as of the Effective Time, all such
Company Stock Options shall be cancelled and have no further force or
effect.   (d) RESTRICTED STOCK. All unvested shares of restricted stock of
the Company set forth in Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without further action of the Company,

of all restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1.   (e)

obligations of the Company under the Company\'s severance plan, policy,
program or procedure, all as set forth in Section 6.9(e) of the

limitations set forth in Section 5.1(g)(iii) of this Agreement, the Company
Board shall be entitled to declare and pay annual bonuses for 2002 to the
employees of the Company in accordance with the existing bonus criteria set
forth in Section 6.9(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (g) RETENTION
PLAN. The Company Board shall be entitled to establish a retention plan, and
to make payments in accordance with such plan, for certain employees of the
Company, in each case as set forth in Section 6.9(g) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.  (h) SECTION 125-C PLAN. The Company shall take all
actions required to amend the Company\'s Section 125-c Plan effective as of
December 31, 2002 such that each participant under the Section 125-c Plan is
subject to a maximum annual contribution to the medical reimbursement portion
of the Section 125-c Plan of $1,000.   Section 6.10 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN
MATTERS. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement that is qualified by materiality becomes untrue
or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement that is not so qualified becomes untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect, or (ii) any failure of the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, materially to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available     -50-   hereunder
to the party receiving such notice; and, PROVIDED FURTHER, that failure to
give such notice shall not be treated as a breach of covenant for
the purposes of Sections 7.2(b) or 7.3(b), as the case may be.   Section
6.11 COORDINATION OF DIVIDENDS. Except with respect to dividends or
distributions of up to $2.3438 per year per share to holders of the Company
Preferred Stock in accordance with past practices and the terms of Section 2
of the Articles Supplementary of the Company -- 9 3/8% Series A Cumulative

cash reserves sufficient for the payment of all deferred amounts) in full any
fees, penalties, taxes, costs, expenses or other amounts payable by the
Company or any of its affiliates (regardless of whether due at such time or
on a deferred basis) pursuant to or in connection with the Closing Agreement,

-56-    (i) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached any of

consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on
its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the other

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent

Parent shall promptly (but in no event later than the date of
such termination) pay the Company an amount equal to the Company\'s Expenses

-57-   Company. In the event that this Agreement is terminated (1) by

and the condition set forth in Section 7.2(h) has not been fulfilled by the
Drop-Dead Date, (3) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f), or
(4) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(i), then the Company shall promptly
(but in no event later than the date of such termination) pay Parent an
amount equal to Parent\'s Expenses by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by Parent. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
(i) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d), (ii) by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), (iii) (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f)
and (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall at the time of such termination be
publicly proposed or publicly announced and within 12 months after such
termination, the Company or any of its subsidiaries enters into
any definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, such Acquisition
Proposal, or (iv) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and at
the time of termination an Acquisition Proposal had been received by the
Company and either prior to termination of this Agreement or within 12 months
thereafter the Company or any subsidiary consummates an Acquisition Proposal
or enters into any definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal that is subsequently consummated (whether or not such Acquisition
Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal which had been received at the time
of termination of this Agreement) with the Person (or an affiliate of such
Person) who made the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company prior to
the termination date, then the Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to
the Termination Fee (as hereinafter defined) by wire transfer of same day
funds to an account designated by Parent, in the case of a payment as a
result of any event referred to in Section 8.3(b)(iii) or (iv), upon the
first to occur of the entering into any definitive agreement or the
consummation of the Acquisition Proposal and in the case of a payment as a
result of any event referred to in Sections 8.3(b)(i) or (ii), promptly, but
in no event later than the date of such termination. For purposes of this
Sections 8.3(b), an "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in Section 9.11, except that the reference to "20 percent" in such
definition shall be deemed to be a reference to "50 percent". As used in this
Agreement, the "TERMINATION FEE" shall be an amount equal to the lesser of
(x) the sum of $16,000,000 plus Parent\'s Expenses (such sum, the
"BASE AMOUNT") and (y) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to
Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and
856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code ("QUALIFYING INCOME"), as determined by
independent accountants to Parent, and (B) in the event Parent receives an
opinion or a letter from outside counsel (the "TERMINATION FEE TAX OPINION")
indicating that Parent has received an opinion of counsel or a ruling from
the IRS holding that Parent\'s receipt of the Base Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of Parent
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the "REIT
REQUIREMENTS") or that the receipt by Parent of the remaining balance of the
Base Amount following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would not be
deemed constructively received prior thereto, the Base Amount less the amount
payable under clause (A) above. In the event that Parent is not able to
receive the full Base Amount, the Company shall place the unpaid amount in
escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent unless and until
the Company receives either one of the following: (x) a letter from Parent\'s
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at
that time to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the
REIT Requirements or (y) a Termination Fee Tax Opinion, in either of which
events the Company shall pay to Parent the lesser of the unpaid Base Amount
or     -58-   the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in
clause (y) above. The Company\'s obligation to pay any unpaid portion of the
Termination Fee shall terminate three (3) years from the date of this
Agreement.   (c) The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained
in Section 8.3(b) above are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty. In the
event that the Company or Parent is required to file to seek all or a portion
of the amounts payable under this Section 8.3, and such party prevails in
such litigation, such party shall be entitled to receive, in addition to all
amounts that it is otherwise entitled to receive under this Section 8.3, all
expenses (including attorneys\' fees) which it has incurred in enforcing its
rights hereunder.   Section 8.4 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by
action taken by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub at any time before or
after approval of the Merger by the Company Requisite Vote and Parent
Requisite Vote but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which
requires the approval of any such stockholders under applicable Law without
such approvals. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto.   Section 8.5 EXTENSION;
WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto may (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance
by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of either party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party. The failure of either party hereto to assert any of
its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.
