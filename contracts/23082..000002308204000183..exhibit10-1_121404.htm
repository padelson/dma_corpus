The Draft Calculations will be prepared using the items and adjustments set forth on <U>Schedule 1.3(a)(ii)</U>, based on the account balances of the Dyn International Companies prepared in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Unaudited FY2004 Balance Sheet.  For the avoidance of doubt, if the day immediately prior to the Closing Date is not the last day of a CSC fiscal month and, as a result, financial data availability is limited (such as due to financial systems limitations) with respect to certain account balances, CSC will roll forward such account balances from its most recent fiscal month-end using reasonable and supportable methodology to derive the applicable account balances for purposes of generating the Draft Calculations.  Seller will make available to Acquisition all records and work papers used in preparing or related to the preparation of the Draft Calculations.  If Acquisition disagrees with the Draft Calculations or the math used to compute the Draft Calculations (or any amount reflected in the Draft Calculations), it shall, within 30 days after receipt of the Draft Calculations, deliver a notice (an "<B>Objection</B> <B>Notice</B>") to CSC setting forth in reasonable detail the disputed amount(s), the calculation of such amount(s) and the basis for each disagreement therewith.  An Objection Notice may only include disagreements based on matters of fact or departures from those accounting policies and accounting practices included in <U>Schedule 1.3(a)(ii)</U>.  For the avoidance of doubt, an Objection Notice may not contain (and the parties hereto (and the Firm (as defined below)) shall disregard) any dispute(s) concerning any amount(s) included in the Draft Calculations derived on a basis consistent with the accounting policies and accounting practices set forth on <U>Schedule 1.3(a)(ii)</U> on the basis that a different amount than that set forth in the Draft Calculations may be derived in accordance with an accounting policy or practice that is not set forth on <U>Schedule 1.3(a)(ii)</U>.  Acquisition and CSC will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements as to the computations of the Draft Calculations, but if they do not obtain a final resolution within 30 days after the Seller has received the Objection Notice, Acquisition and CSC will jointly retain an accounting firm of recognized national standing to be mutually agreed to by CSC and Acquisition (the "<B>Firm</B>") to resolve any disagreements.  Acquisition and CSC will direct the Firm to use its best efforts to render a determination within 60 days of its retention and Acquisition, CSC, and their respective agents will cooperate with the Firm during its engagement.  The Firm will consider only those items and amounts in the Draft Calculations set forth in the Objection Notice which Acquisition and CSC are unable to resolve.  Acquisition and CSC shall each submit a binder to the Firm promptly (and in any event within 30 days after the Firm's engagement), which binder shall contain such party's information, arguments, and support for such party's position related to the unresolved items contained in the Objection Notice.  The Firm shall review such binders and base its determination solely on them and any oral arguments presented to the Firm at the Firm's election.  The Firm's determination will be based on the definitions of the Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Surplus and Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Shortfall included herein and on the accounting policies and accounting practices described in <U>Schedule 1.3(a)(ii)</U>.  Absent manifest error, the determination of the Firm will be conclusive and binding upon (and not appealable by) CSC, the Seller, Parent and Acquisition.</TD>

Thereafter, Acquisition and the Seller shall file all applicable Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the allocations agreed to by Acquisition and the Seller or determined by the Appraiser, as the case may be, and shall not take any positions inconsistent with such allocations unless required by Law.</TD>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Insured Claims</U>.  The Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable efforts, consistent with such party's past practice, to obtain under any applicable insurance policies any insurance proceeds in respect of any claim for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Article 7.  The amount of any indemnified Losses hereunder shall be determined net of the amount, if any, of the recovery actually received by the Indemnified Party with respect to such indemnified Losses under any such insurance or similar policy less (i) any reasonable out-of-pocket collection costs; (ii) any amount which is reimbursed by the Indemnified Party or an affiliate thereof, directly or indirectly, that is charged back to the Indemnified Party or an affiliate thereof or that is not otherwise received for the permanent benefit of the Indemnified Party (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 4.16); and (iii) any other reasonable out-of-pocket cost which may reasonably be borne by the Indemnified Party or an affiliate thereof as a result of such insurance claim or recovery, whether as a result of any self-insurance arrangement, retention amount, deductible amount or otherwise.  The Indemnitor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Indemnified Party to recover amounts under insurance policies or other rights of the Indemnified Party (including the Dyn International Companies) with respect to such indemnified amount and, in the event that an insurance recovery is received by an Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which any Indemnified Party has previously been indemnified by the Indemnitor pursuant hereto, then such Indemnified shall promptly make a refund to the Indemnitor an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of such insurance recovery (net of any reasonable out-of-pocket collection costs), and (ii) the amount previously paid by the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party as indemnification for such Loss.</TD>

Acquisition shall reimburse CSC (or the Seller, as the case may be) for the Tax Benefit relating to the Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article 7.  Tax Benefit is the actual reduction in federal income taxes of Acquisition or the Dyn International Companies resulting from the deduction of the Losses to which the indemnity payment relates.  For this purpose, it shall be assumed that all other deductions to which Acquisition or the Dyn International Companies are entitled are taken before the deduction for the Losses at issue.  The Tax Benefit shall be estimated in good faith and netted against the corresponding indemnity payment made to Acquisition at the time of such payment.  The Tax Benefit shall be finally determined at the time Acquisition files the corresponding federal income Tax Return that includes the Loss, and the parties shall make appropriate payments based on the difference between the estimated and the actual Tax Benefit.</TD>
