PURCHASE AGREEMENT  
--- 
    
  

 This PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of December 12, 2004 (this "Agreement"), is made by and between Computer Sciences Corporation, a Nevada corporation ("CSC"), and DynCorp, a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC ("DynCorp" or "Seller"), on the one hand, and The Veritas Capital Fund II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Parent"), and DI Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition"), on the other hand.  
    
  

RECITALS  
    
  

 A. DynCorp owns 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the "DI Interests") of DynCorp International LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("DI" and together with its direct and indirect Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined) after giving effect to the Internal Alignment Transactions (as hereinafter defined), the "Dyn International Companies").  
    
  

 B. Following the execution of this Agreement, CSC, the Seller and certain of their affiliates shall consummate the Internal Alignment Transactions.   
    
  

 C. Parent has formed Acquisition for the purpose of acquiring all of the DI Interests.  
    
  

 D. Prior to Closing, Acquisition will authorize preferred stock (the "Acquisition Preferred Stock"), pursuant to a Certificate of Designations (the "Certificate of Designations") in accordance with the term sheet attached hereto as _Exhibit A_.  
    
  

 E. The Seller wishes to sell to Acquisition, and Acquisition wishes to purchase from the Seller, the DI Interests, in exchange for the aggregate consideration described herein.  
    
  

 F. The parties hereto intend to enter into certain agreements governing their relationships after the Closing Date, as contemplated hereby.  
    
  

 In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  
    
  

AGREEMENT  
    
  

ARTICLE 1  
    
  

PURCHASE AND SALE  
    
  

 Section 1.1. _Purchase and Sale of the DI Interests_.  
    
  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver the DI Interests to Acquisition, and Acquisition shall purchase and acquire the DI Interests from the Seller, free and clear of all Liens (other than those created by, or on behalf of, Acquisition), for the following consideration:  
    
  

1  
    
    
  

 (1) $775,000,000 (the "Cash Component"); and  
    
  

 (2) a number of shares of Acquisition Preferred Stock having an aggregate stated value of $75,000,000 (the "Initial Stock Component"), as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.3(e) below (the "Stock Component" and, together with the Cash Component, the "Purchase Price").  
    
  

 Section 1.2. _Closing_.  
    
  

 (a) The sale and purchase of the DI Interests shall take place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held at a time, place and date mutually agreeable to CSC and Acquisition after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law (as hereinafter defined), waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in Article 6 (other than such conditions as may, by their terms, only be satisfied at the Closing or on the Closing Date), or at such other place or at such other time or on such other date as CSC and Acquisition mutually may agree in writing. The day on which the Closing takes place is referred to as the "Closing Date."  
    
  

 (b) At the Closing, (1) Acquisition shall (A) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Seller, by wire transfer to a bank account designated in writing by CSC to Acquisition at least two business days prior to the Closing Date, the Cash Component in immediately available funds in United States dollars, and (B) deliver to CSC stock certificates (in such denominations and registered in such name(s) as CSC shall request) (the "Preferred Stock Certificates") representing the Initial Stock Component, and (2) the Seller shall deliver, and CSC shall cause the Seller to deliver, to Acquisition such instruments of transfer as are necessary to transfer the DI Interests.  
    
  

 Section 1.3. _Adjustment to the Stock Component_.  
    
  

 (a) As used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings:  
    
  

 "FY2004 Pro Forma Net Working Capital Amount" shall mean an amount equal to the Net Working Capital of the Dyn International Companies as of April 2, 2004, based on the Unaudited FY2004 Balance Sheet and calculated as set forth on _Schedule 1.3(a)(i)_. The items and adjustments constituting "Net Working Capital" are set forth on _Schedule 1.3(a)(i)_.  
    
  

 "Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Amount" shall mean an amount equal to the Net Working Capital of the Dyn International Companies as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, calculated on the basis set forth on _Schedule 1.3(a)(ii)_ , including the adjustments set forth thereon.   
    
  

 "Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Shortfall" shall mean the excess, if any, of the FY2004 Pro Forma Net Working Capital Amount over the Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Amount.  
    
  

 "Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Surplus" shall mean the excess, if any, of the Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Amount over the FY2004 Pro Forma Net Working Capital Amount.  
    
  

2  
    
    
  

 (b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, CSC shall prepare and deliver or cause to be prepared and delivered to Acquisition a schedule showing the calculation of the Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Amount (the "Draft Calculations"). The Draft Calculations will be prepared using the items and adjustments set forth on _Schedule 1.3(a)(ii)_ , based on the account balances of the Dyn International Companies prepared in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Unaudited FY2004 Balance Sheet. For the avoidance of doubt, if the day immediately prior to the Closing Date is not the last day of a CSC fiscal month and, as a result, financial data availability is limited (such as due to financial systems limitations) with respect to certain account balances, CSC will roll forward such account balances from its most recent fiscal month-end using reasonable and supportable methodology to derive the applicable account balances for purposes of generating the Draft Calculations. Seller will make available to Acquisition all records and work papers used in preparing or related to the preparation of the Draft Calculations. If Acquisition disagrees with the Draft Calculations or the math used to compute the Draft Calculations (or any amount reflected in the Draft Calculations), it shall, within 30 days after receipt of the Draft Calculations, deliver a notice (an "Objection Notice") to CSC setting forth in reasonable detail the disputed amount(s), the calculation of such amount(s) and the basis for each disagreement therewith. An Objection Notice may only include disagreements based on matters of fact or departures from those accounting policies and accounting practices included in _Schedule 1.3(a)(ii)_. For the avoidance of doubt, an Objection Notice may not contain (and the parties hereto (and the Firm (as defined below)) shall disregard) any dispute(s) concerning any amount(s) included in the Draft Calculations derived on a basis consistent with the accounting policies and accounting practices set forth on _Schedule 1.3(a)(ii)_ on the basis that a different amount than that set forth in the Draft Calculations may be derived in accordance with an accounting policy or practice that is not set forth on _Schedule 1.3(a)(ii)_. Acquisition and CSC will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements as to the computations of the Draft Calculations, but if they do not obtain a final resolution within 30 days after the Seller has received the Objection Notice, Acquisition and CSC will jointly retain an accounting firm of recognized national standing to be mutually agreed to by CSC and Acquisition (the "Firm") to resolve any disagreements. Acquisition and CSC will direct the Firm to use its best efforts to render a determination within 60 days of its retention and Acquisition, CSC, and their respective agents will cooperate with the Firm during its engagement. The Firm will consider only those items and amounts in the Draft Calculations set forth in the Objection Notice which Acquisition and CSC are unable to resolve. Acquisition and CSC shall each submit a binder to the Firm promptly (and in any event within 30 days after the Firm\'s engagement), which binder shall contain such party\'s information, arguments, and support for such party\'s position related to the unresolved items contained in the Objection Notice. The Firm shall review such binders and base its determination solely on them and any oral arguments presented to the Firm at the Firm\'s election. The Firm\'s determination will be based on the definitions of the Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Surplus and Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Shortfall included herein and on the accounting policies and accounting practices described in _Schedule 1.3(a)(ii)_. Absent manifest error, the determination of the Firm will be conclusive and binding upon (and not appealable by) CSC, the Seller, Parent and Acquisition.  
    
  

 (c) The fees and expenses of the Firm to resolve any such dispute shall be paid one-half by CSC (or the Seller) and one-half by Acquisition.  
    
  

3  
    
    
  

 (d) Each of the Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Amount and the Closing Pro Forma Net Working Surplus or Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Shortfall, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been finally determined upon the first to occur of:  
    
  

 (i) acceptance by Acquisition of the Draft Calculations,  
    
  

 (ii) Acquisition\'s failure to deliver an Objection Notice to CSC within 30 days of receipt of the Draft Calculations,   
    
  

 (iii) resolution by mutual agreement of CSC and Acquisition after CSC\'s receipt of a timely delivered Objection Notice or   
    
  

 (iv) notification by the Firm of its final determination thereof  
    
  

 The Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Surplus or Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Shortfall, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.3(d), are referred to herein as the "Final Net Working Capital Surplus" or "Final Net Working Capital Shortfall", respectively.  
    
  

 (e) Within five business days after the final determination thereof, CSC will pay to Acquisition or Acquisition will pay to CSC (on behalf of the Seller) the Final Net Working Capital Shortfall or the Final Net Working Capital Surplus, as the case may be. Such payments will be made (A) in the case of Acquisition, by the delivery to CSC of stock certificates (in such denominations and registered in such name(s) as CSC shall request) (the "Additional Preferred Stock Certificates") representing that number of additional shares of Acquisition Preferred Stock as shall have an aggregate stated value as of the Closing Date equal to the Final Net Working Capital Surplus (subject to adjustment to the payment date as provided in the Certificate of Designations (assuming for this purpose that the Additional Preferred Stock Certificates had been issued to CSC (or its designee) on the Closing Date and held continuously by such person from the Closing Date until the date that payment is made under this Section 1.3)) and (B) in the case of CSC, by delivery to Acquisition of Preferred Stock Certificates, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer, with appropriate transfer stamps, if any, affixed, representing that number of shares of Acquisition Preferred Stock as shall have an aggregate stated value as of the Closing Date equal to the Final Net Working Capital Shortfall.  
    
  

ARTICLE 2  
    
  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CSC AND THE SELLER  
    
  

 Each of CSC and the Seller represents and warrants to Acquisition (on the basis that the consummation of the Internal Alignment Transactions had occurred prior to all dates relevant to such representations and warranties and that all references to the Dyn International Companies in any such representations and warranties are a reference to the Dyn International Companies after giving effect to the consummation of the Internal Alignment Transactions unless the context clearly indicates otherwise) that:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to those individuals whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by collective bargaining agreements or, in respect of the Non-U.S. Employees, by provisions of law outside the United States, Acquisition shall expressly assume and comply with the terms of such collective bargaining agreements and comply with the provisions of such foreign laws with respect to the subject matter relating hereto, to the extent such agreements and/or laws require terms and conditions other than those provided for herein.  
    
  

 (h) Acquisition shall maintain, for a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, the retirement plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code that is transferred to Acquisition (the "Bifurcated 401(k) Plan") for the purpose of providing benefits to U.S. Employees and Terminated U.S. Employees who previously were participants in, or eligible to participate in, the CSC MAP. On or before the Closing Date, DI (the sponsor of the Bifurcated 401(k) Plan) shall adopt, in respect of the Bifurcated 401(k) Plan, an amendment substantially in the form of _Exhibit J_ hereto, to be effective immediately after the Closing and to provide that: (i) no new contributions (either employee pretax contributions, employer matching or discretionary contributions, loan repayments, fund transfers, reallocation of other assets of a participant\'s account, or otherwise) shall be permitted to be made, after the effective time of the amendment, into the CSC stock fund; (ii) all accounts or portions thereof held in the form of common stock of CSC that were not diversifiable as of the Closing Date shall become  
    
  

40  
    
    
  

diversifiable as of the effective time of the amendment and shall remain
diversifiable so long as the common stock of CSC remains an investment
alternative under the Bifurcated 401(k) Plan; and (iii) from the effective
time of the amendment through the six month anniversary of the Closing Date,
CSC shall have the right to purchase from the trustee of the Bifurcated 401(k)
Plan (the "Trustee") all shares of CSC common stock that are offered for sale
by the Trustee, pursuant to the terms set forth in the amendment; _provided,
however_ , that CSC shall have no obligation to purchase such shares. All
accounts or portions thereof held in the form of common stock of CSC that
already were diversifiable in the Bifurcated 401(k) Plan as of the Closing
Date shall remain diversifiable after the Closing Date. Acquisition agrees
that the Bifurcated 401(k) Plan shall continue to provide a CSC stock fund as
an investment alternative for a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date
for the purpose of retaining (subject to the participants\' right to diversify
described previously) existing accounts held in the form of common stock of
CSC, except to the extent that Acquisition or fiduciaries of the Bifurcated
401(k) Plan determine that to do so would violate its or their obligations
under ERISA.  
    
  

 (i) Except to the extent that Acquisition, in its reasonable discretion, determines is necessary to avoid duplication of benefits, Acquisition shall give (i) credit for eligibility and/or vesting purposes under any plan or program applicable to the Non-U.S. Employees after the Closing Date to the same extent such service is taken into account under the Foreign Benefit Plans or other plans or programs applicable to the Non-U.S. Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) credit for vacation accruals as recorded in the records of the Dyn International Companies as of the Closing Date and to the extent the liability associated with such vacation accruals are included in the calculation of the Closing Pro Forma Net Working Capital Amount, and (iii) service credit for purposes of the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and similar state and local leave laws to the extent such service has been credited by the Dyn International Companies for FMLA purposes as of the Closing Date, in all events subject to Law and the terms and conditions of the Employee Plans and Foreign Benefit Plans, as applicable.  
    
  

 (j) The parties hereto agree that Acquisition shall be liable for the cost of all claims for health (including medical, dental, vision, and prescription drug), accidental injury, disability, sickness, business travel insurance, and life insurance benefits (with respect to the Employee Plans and with respect to any plan or program applicable to the Non-U.S. Employees) that have not been paid as of the Closing Date, except to the extent that such a claim is required to be paid by the carrier of an insurance policy maintained by CSC, any Employee Plan or any plan or program applicable to the Non-U.S. Employees pursuant to the terms of such insurance policy. CSC and the Seller shall, to the extent permitted under Law, provide their files (including "original documentation") to Acquisition with respect to all claims that are the responsibility of Acquisition pursuant to this Section 4.8(j), and CSC and the Seller reasonably shall cooperate with Acquisition in resolving such claims.   
    
  

 (k) Acquisition, and the Seller agree that Acquisition, as of the Closing Date, shall be solely liable for expenses in connection with and responsible for the resolution of (i) all grievances, arbitrations, unfair labor practices and other similar items relating to U.S. Employees and Terminated U.S. Employees who are or were covered by a collective bargaining unit, regardless of the date of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such item; and (ii) all human resources issues, including, without limitation, compliance with the Service Contract Act of  
    
  

41  
    
    
  

1965, as amended, compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as
amended, and discrimination complaints relating to the U.S. Employees and
Terminated U.S. Employees, regardless of the date of the occurrence of the
event giving rise to such issue.  
    
  

 (l) For avoidance of doubt, for purposes of Sections 4.8(g) through 4.8(k), U.S. Employees and Non-U.S. Employees shall refer only to those individuals who (i) are actively employed by the Dyn International Companies immediately prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) are on vacation, disability, family leave, layoff or other leaves of absence that have been agreed or consented to by the Dyn International Companies (or protected by Law) immediately prior to the Closing Date and who actually return to active service with Acquisition within 12 months (or such other period protected by Law) after the Closing Date.   
    
  

 (m) The provisions of this Section 4.8 shall not create in any person any right to employment or continued employment with Acquisition or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates.  
    
  

 Section 4.9. _Cash Settlement; Intercompany Arrangements_. Immediately prior to the Closing: (i) all cash and cash equivalents of the Dyn International Companies shall be transferred to CSC or an affiliate thereof; (ii) all intercompany receivables and liabilities of the Dyn International Companies, as of the Closing Date, that are receivable from or owed to CSC, the Seller or any of their affiliates (other than the Dyn International Companies), and (iii) all Contracts between any of the Dyn International Companies, on the one hand, and CSC, the Seller or any of their affiliates (other than the Dyn International Companies), on the other hand, other than those that are set forth on _Schedule 4.9_ hereto, shall be cancelled, in each case, without any consideration or further liability to any party and without the need for any further documentation.   
    
  

 Section 4.10. _Release of Guarantees and Letters of Credit_. CSC, the Seller and Acquisition shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts (a) to obtain the release, effective as of the Closing Date, of CSC, the Seller and their affiliates (other than the Dyn International Companies) that are a party to or bound by a guarantee, performance bond, surety bond, bid bond or other similar agreement relating to the operation of the business of the Dyn International Companies, including the guarantees, performance bonds, bid bonds and other similar agreements listed in _Schedule 4.10_ (the "Guarantees") and (b) to cause to be issued, effective as of the Closing Date, letters of credit on the account of Acquisition or the Dyn International Companies as replacement letters of credit for ones issued by CSC, Seller or their affiliates (other than the Dyn International Companies) prior to the Closing Date in connection with the operation of the business of the Dyn International Companies, including those letters of credit in the amount and for the beneficiaries identified on _Schedule 4.10_ (the "Letters of Credit"), which Schedule shall set forth the amount of each such Letter of Credit. In the event any of the Guarantees or Letters of Credit are not released prior to or at the Closing, Acquisition will provide CSC and the Seller with a guarantee that indemnifies and holds CSC, the Seller and their affiliates (other than the Dyn International Companies) that are a party to each such Guarantee or Letter of Credit harmless for any and all payments required to be made under, or costs incurred in connection with, such Guarantee or Letter of Credit by CSC, the Seller or such affiliates following the Closing until it is released for Events that occur following the Closing.  
    
  

42  
    
    
  

 Section 4.11. _Novation_.   
    
  

 (a) CSC and the Seller hereby agree to cooperate and to provide such reasonable assistance to Acquisition and the Dyn International Companies, and Acquisition and the Dyn International Companies shall cooperate and provide such reasonable assistance to CSC and the Seller, as may be reasonably required in the event that any Governmental Entity requires a novation of any Government Contract at any time following the Closing Date.  
    
  

 (b) CSC and Seller covenant and agree that:  
    
  

 (i) to the extent that the assignment of any Government Contract or Bid by CSC or any of its affiliates (other than the Dyn International Companies) to one of the Dyn International Companies that are scheduled to be assigned to a Dyn International Company prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the Internal Alignment Transactions requires a novation (the "Internal Alignment Novations"), CSC and/or Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or complete all such Internal Alignment Novations prior to the Closing Date;   
    
  

 (ii) to the extent that any Government Contract or Bid requires notification to a Government Entity with respect to the execution of the Purchase Agreement and/or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby (the "Contract Notifications"), CSC shall make all such Contract Notifications as promptly as practicable following the execution of the Purchase Agreement; and   
    
  

 (iii) promptly following the LLC Conversions, CSC and/or Seller shall commence any novations of Government Contracts or Bids that are required as a result of such LLC Conversions (the "Conversion Novations").  
    
  

 Section 4.12. _Intentionally Omitted_.  
    
  

 Section 4.13. _Nonsolicitation and Noncompetition_.  
    
  

 (a) For the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the expiration of three years following the Closing Date, none of Acquisition, the Dyn International Companies, or the Joint Ventures (collectively with their respective successors, the "Acquisition Group"), on the one hand, or CSC or any of its affiliates (other than, following the Closing, the Dyn International Companies and the Joint Ventures) (collectively with their respective successors, the "Seller Group"), on the other hand, shall, either on its own account or for any person, firm or company (except by means of a general public solicitation or by retaining an executive recruiting firm that has not been directed to approach and does not approach employees of any member of the other group), solicit, or endeavor to cause any employee of a member of the other group, to alter in any way, terminate or breach his, her or its relationship or agreement with any such member of the other group or its respective successors.  
    
  

 (b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.13(b)_ , during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the expiration of 24 months following the Closing Date, no member of the Seller Group shall, directly or indirectly, compete against any member of the Acquisition Group for any renewals or extensions of (i) any customer Contract or Government  
    
  

43  
    
    
  

Contract of any member of the Acquisition Group that is actively being
performed as of the Closing Date or (ii) any Government Contract awarded based
on a Bid that has been assigned and novated to a Dyn International Company by
any member of the Seller Group in connection with the Internal Alignment
Transactions or the sale of the DI Interests ("Competition"); _provided,
however_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit:  
    
  

 (i) any investment by a member of the Seller Group of less than 5% of the equity securities (as determined at the time of investment) in a person if the investing member does not actively participate in the management, supervision or conduct of such person, whether through membership or participation in such person\'s board of directors, governing committee, management or otherwise;  
    
  

 (ii) the acquisition (by any means) by a member of the Seller Group of all or any portion of a person that is, at the time of such acquisition, engaged in Competition with any member of the Acquisition Group, if the revenues attributable to such Competition represents less than one-fifth of such newly acquired person\'s revenues and less than one-fifth of such newly acquired person\'s assets; or  
    
  

 (iii) any investment by a member of the Seller Group of up to 20% in another person if the investing member determines in good faith that such investment is primarily motivated by the receipt by the member or one of its affiliates, or a reasonable expectation that the member or one of its affiliates will receive, a Contract of significance (in relation to the amount of the investment) for the provision of goods and/or services, to such person, and the procurement of that Contract alone would not constitute Competition hereunder.  
    
  

 (c) The parties hereto agree that the durations and worldwide area for which the covenants set forth in this Section 4.13 are to be effective are reasonable. In the event that any court determines that the time period or such area is unreasonable and that such covenant is to that extent unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the covenant shall remain in full force and effect for the greatest time period and in the greatest area that would not render it unenforceable. The parties intend that each of the covenants set forth in Sections 4.13(a) and (b) shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants one for each and every county of each and every state of the United States of America and each and every political subdivision of each and every country outside of the United States of America where such covenant is intended to be effective. The parties hereto agree that damages may be an inadequate remedy for any breach of the covenants set forth in this Section 4.13 and that each of CSC and the Seller, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition, on the other hand (as the case may be), shall, whether or not it is pursuing any potential remedies at law, be entitled to equitable relief in the form of preliminary or permanent injunctions without bond or other security upon any actual breach of the covenant contained in this Section 4.13 benefiting such party.  
    
  

 Section 4.14. _Financial Statements_   
    
  

 (a) CSC and the Seller shall deliver, or shall cause the Dyn International Companies to deliver, to Acquisition on or prior to January 14, 2005 the financial data deliverables set forth on _Schedule 4.14(a)_.  
    
  

44  
    
    
  

 (b) CSC and the Seller shall cause the Dyn International Companies to take all such other action as shall be reasonably requested by Acquisition or otherwise customary in order to assist DI, and, if applicable, one or more of Acquisition\'s Subsidiaries as of the Closing in consummating, simultaneously with the Closing, an underwritten "high yield" debt offering (the "Rule 144A Offering") to "qualified institutional buyers" within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the Dyn International Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) assist Acquisition in the preparation of an offering memorandum, including, without limitation, any pro forma financial statements and the "Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section to be included therein (in accordance with the requirements of Item 303 of Regulation S-K), (ii) promptly respond to any diligence inquiries of the underwriters of the Rule 144A Offering, (iii) make its officers and employees available to participate in diligence sessions, drafting sessions and the road show for the Rule 144A Offering, (iv) cause its independent auditors to issue a customary comfort letter to the underwriters of the Rule 144A Offering and (v) if necessary, deliver or cause to be delivered to Acquisition financial data of the Dyn International Companies for the fiscal periods ending on or about December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 that is comparable to the financial data described in items 3, 4 and 5 of _Schedule 4.14(a)_ (or, if required, items 1, 2 and 5 of _Schedule 4.14(a)_ ).  
    
  

 (c) Following the Closing, CSC and the Seller shall, to the extent reasonably requested by Acquisition in order to assist the Dyn International Companies in the consummation of a registered exchange offering of the private notes issued in the Rule 144A Offering (the "Exchange Offer"), at Acquisition\'s cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Acquisition and the Dyn International Companies in the preparation and/or compilation of any additional financial statements or information that may be required in connection with the Exchange Offer, including, without limitation, the financial data deliverable set forth on _Schedule 4.14(c)_ and any other unaudited interim financial information relating to any period prior to the Closing or any information related to any period prior to the Closing required to be furnished in response to any comment received from the Commission in connection with the Exchange Offer. The parties hereby agree that, in addition to any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by CSC or the Seller (including the fees and expenses of their attorneys and the Auditors), the internal costs and expenses of CSC, the Seller and their Affiliate incurred in connection with their assistance with respect to the Exchange Offer, whether incurred before or after the Closing Date, shall be reimbursed in full by Acquisition promptly following the delivery of any invoice setting forth such costs and expenses. The internal costs of CSC and the Seller with respect to their participation and assistance in the Exchange Offer shall be billed to Acquisition based upon the fully burdened rates of the relevant personnel providing such assistance.  
    
  

 (d) Acquisition shall consult with CSC\'s legal personnel based in El Segundo, California with respect to any of the offering materials to be used by Acquisition in connection with the 144A Offering and/or the Exchange Offer, including any offering memorandum or prospectus used in connection therewith (the "Note Offering Materials"), prior to the dissemination thereof, and shall afford them reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. Acquisition shall give due and reasonable consideration to any comments, language or disclosure (including risk factors) proposed by CSC\'s legal personnel based in El Segundo, California with respect to the Note Offering Materials. If at any time any event should occur that is required by  
    
  

45  
    
    
  

applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or supplement to, any of
the Offering Materials, prior to dissemination of such amendment or
supplement, Acquisition shall consult with CSC\'s legal personnel based in El
Segundo, California with respect to such amendment or supplement and shall
afford them reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.  
    
  

 (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4.14, neither CSC nor the Seller shall be responsible for the consummation of the Rule 144A Offering or the Exchange Offer.  
    
  

 Section 4.15. _Filing of the Certificate of Designations_. Acquisition shall, prior to the Closing Date, file the Certificate of Designations with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.  
    
  

 Section 4.16. _Insurance Matters; Cooperation_.  
    
  

 (a) Each member of the Seller Group, on the one hand, and each member of the Acquisition Group, on the other hand, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to share such information as is reasonably necessary in order to permit the members of the other group to manage and conduct its insurance matters in an orderly fashion. Each member of the Seller Group and the Acquisition Group, at the request of a member of the other group, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist the other in recoveries for claims made under any Insurance Policy for the benefit of any member of either group, and, except as expressly provided in this Section 4.16, neither CSC nor Acquisition, nor any member of either group, shall take any action that would be reasonably likely to jeopardize or otherwise interfere with either party\'s ability to collect any proceeds payable pursuant to any insurance policy.   
    
  

 (b) Except as otherwise specified in this Section 4.16, members of the Acquisition Group shall have no rights with respect to any Insurance Policies, except that members of the Acquisition Group will have the right to (i) assert claims under the Insurance Policies in the manner specified in Section 4.16(f) and, to the extent permitted by the insurers under the Insurance Policies, to assist in resolving existing and pending claims under Insurance Policies for any loss, liability or damage arising out of insured incidents to the extent relating to the business of the Dyn International Companies occurring from the date coverage thereunder first commenced until the Closing Date and (ii) to extent permitted under such Insurance Policies, exercise all rights and privileges and procure all proceeds of such Insurance Policies relating to the claims specified in clause (i); _provided, that_ (x) all of CSC\'s and each member of the Seller Group\'s reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing shall be promptly (but in no event more than 30 days after the receipt of an invoice therefor) paid by or on behalf of Acquisition and (y) CSC and the members of the Seller Group may, at any time, without liability or obligation to any member of the Acquisition Group (other than as set forth in Section 4.16(c)), amend, commute, terminate, buy-out, extinguish liability under or otherwise modify any Insurance Policy (and such Insurance Policy shall be subject to any such amendments, commutations, terminations, buy-outs, extinguishments and modifications). No member of the Seller Group shall bear any liability for the failure of an insurer to pay any claim under any Insurance Policy.  
    
  

46  
    
    
  

 (c) No member of the Seller Group shall, except in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, amend, commute, terminate, buy-out, extinguish liability under to otherwise modify any Insurance Policies with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date. In the event that after the Closing Date, any member of the Seller Group proposes to amend, commute, terminate, buy-out, extinguish liability under or otherwise modify any Insurance Policies under which Acquisition has rights to assert claims pursuant to Section 4.16(b) in a manner that would adversely affect any such rights of Acquisition or any member of the Acquisition Group, CSC will give Acquisition prior notice thereof. If Acquisition agrees to indemnify CSC with respect to any cost or liability arising out of its failure to take any of the actions specified in the foregoing sentence, CSC shall not take such action so long as CSC shall be reasonably satisfied that Acquisition shall be able to indemnify CSC with respect to all such costs and liabilities.  
    
  

 (d) Acquisition will reimburse CSC for all out-of-pocket costs necessary to exhaust or otherwise satisfy all applicable deductibles and self-insured retentions in respect of claims brought by or on behalf of the Acquisition Group under such Insurance Policies in addition to Acquisition\'s allocated share of all amounts for fronted policies, overages, and retrospective or prospective premium adjustments, taxes, surcharges, letters of credit backing Insurance Policies and similar amounts not covered by Insurance Policies in the same proportion as such amounts are allocated to members of the Acquisition Group by CSC or its affiliates on the date of this Agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be consistent with CSC\'s or such affiliate\'s past practices).  
    
  

 (e) Each of CSC, the Seller and Acquisition does hereby, for itself and each other member of the Seller Group and the Acquisition Group, as the case may be, agree that all duties and obligations under any Insurance Policy, including the fulfillment of any conditions and the payment of any deductibles, retentions, co-insurance payment or retrospective premiums, that correspond in any way with or may be necessary to perfect, preserve or maintain an insured\'s right to obtain benefits under that Insurance Policy, will be performed by the insured that is seeking the benefits under that Insurance Policy.  
    
  

 (f) CSC or its designee shall be responsible for the claims administration with respect to claims of any member of the Seller Group under the Insurance Policies, and Acquisition or its designee shall, to the extent permitted by the applicable insurers under the Insurance Policies, be responsible for the claims administration with respect to claims of any member of the Acquisition Group under the Insurance Policies. In the event that any such insurer requires that CSC or its affiliates continue to administer the claims of the Acquisition Group, then CSC or its applicable affiliate shall cooperate with the Acquisition Group to submit claims of the Acquisition Group under the Insurance Policies and shall not settle any such claims without the consent of Acquisition; _provided, that_ all of CSC\'s and each member of the Seller Group\'s reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing shall be promptly (but in no event more than 30 days after the receipt of an invoice therefor) paid by or on behalf of the Acquisition Group.  
    
  

 (g) In the event that there are insufficient limits of liability available under the Insurance Policies in effect prior to the Closing Date to cover the liabilities of the Seller Group and/or the Acquisition Group that would otherwise be covered by such Insurance Policies, then  
    
  

47  
    
    
  

the parties shall share the recoveries for such claims under such Insurance
Policies (regardless of how or when received) pro rata, based on the
percentage each party contributed (or is deemed to have contributed) to the
premium of such policy. If proceeds under any of the Insurance Policies are
paid to or for the benefit of any member of the Acquisition Group, on the one
hand, or any member of the Seller Group, on the other hand, after the Closing
Date in excess of the amount to which it is entitled to receive under this
4.16(g), and any member of the other group recovers less than it is entitled
to under this 4.16(g), the party receiving such excess amount shall reimburse
the other party for such excess amount (to the extent necessary to accomplish
the intent of this 4.16(g)).  
    
  

 (h) CSC and Acquisition will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other and execute any additional documents which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 4.16.  
    
  

 (i) The agreements contained in this Section 4.16 shall not be considered as an attempted assignment of any rights or interest in violation of any policy of insurance or as a contract of insurance and shall not be construed to waive any right or remedy of any member of the Seller Group in respect of any Insurance Policy or any other contract or policy of insurance.  
    
  

 (j) Acquisition does hereby, for itself and as agent for each other member of the Acquisition Group, agree that no member of the Seller Group or any Indemnitor shall have any liability whatsoever for any Losses as a result of the insurance policies and practices of CSC and its affiliates as in effect at any time prior to the Closing Date, including as a result of the level or scope of any such insurance, the creditworthiness of any insurance carrier, the terms and conditions of any policy or the adequacy or timeliness of any notice to any insurance carrier with respect to any claim or potential claim or otherwise.  
    
  

 (k) Nothing in this Section 4.16 shall be deemed to restrict any member of the Acquisition Group from acquiring at its own expense any other insurance policy in respect of any liabilities or covering any period.  
    
  

 (l) CSC and the Seller, on the one hand, Acquisition, on the other hand, acknowledge that they intend to allocate financial obligations without violating any laws regarding insurance, self-insurance or other financial responsibility. If it is determined that any action undertaken pursuant to this Section 4.16 or any of the Ancillary Agreements is violative of any insurance, self-insurance or related financial responsibility law or regulation, CSC and the Seller on the one hand, and Acquisition, on the other hand, agree to work together to do whatever is necessary to comply with such law or regulation while trying to accomplish, to the greatest possible extent, the allocation of financial obligations as intended in this Agreement and any of the Ancillary Agreements.  
    
  

 (m) Acquisition further agrees that, unless and until CSC no longer has any liability under the Insurance Policies with respect to claims under the Insurance Policies asserted by or on behalf of Acquisition pursuant to this Section 4.16 for any loss, liability or damage arising out of insured incidents relating to the business of the Dyn International Companies occurring from the date coverage thereunder first commenced until the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Claims"), if Acquisition (or any successor thereto) sells, transfers or otherwise disposes  
    
  

48  
    
    
  

of all or substantially all of the assets of Acquisition and the Dyn
International Companies, taken as a whole, then concurrent with consummation
of such sale or disposition, Acquisition shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
CSC an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all liabilities with respect to
Pre-Closing Claims that, in accordance with GAAP, would be required to be
reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of Acquisition and the Dyn
International Companies as of such date.  
    
  

 Section 4.17. _Foreign Ownership and Related Matters_. Notwithstanding Section 7.1 of this Agreement, from and after the Closing Date and until such time as CSC no longer holds shares of Acquisition Preferred Stock, Acquisition shall take all such actions as are reasonably necessary in order to make the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.11 of this Agreement true and correct on each day following the Closing as if made at and as of such time.  
    
  

 Section 4.18. _Further Assurances_. Each of CSC and the Seller, on the one hand, and Acquisition, on the other hand, shall execute and deliver such documents and take such further actions as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions in this Agreement and in the Ancillary Agreements, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   
    
  

 Section 4.19. _Management of Dyn Marine, Dyn Marine II and DTSAS_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the executive officers of DI shall direct (subject to the provisions hereof) the management and operations of Dyn Marine, Dyn Marine II and DTSAS.  
    
  

 Section 4.20. _Internal Alignment Transactions_. Following the execution of this Agreement, CSC and the Seller shall, and shall cause such of their affiliates as may be necessary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the transactions described on _Schedule 4.20_ (such transactions, together with the actions to be taken by CSC and the Seller pursuant to Sections 4.8(a) through 4.8(e), the "Internal Alignment Transactions").  
    
  

 Section 4.21. _Texas Sales Tax Refunds_.  
    
  

 (a) The U.S. Government, represented by the Defense Contract Management Agency, has notified DTS and DI that, as a result of a change in law in the State of Texas (the "Texas Decisions"), (i) DTS and DI may be entitled to refunds with respect to certain sales and use taxes paid by DTS and DI to the State of Texas for periods ending prior to the Closing Date ("Texas Sales Tax Refunds"); and (ii) the U.S. Government (A) intends to determine a methodology for calculating the impact on contracts of any Texas Sales Tax Refunds actually received by DTS and DI as a result of the Texas Decisions and (B) will not reimburse any indirect cots under any contracts with DTS or DI until each of DTS and DI enter into an agreement (a "Refund Agreement") that will require DTS and DI to negotiate with the Divisional Administrative Contracting Officer (the "DACO") to determine the portion of such Texas Sales Tax Refunds to be credited and/or paid to the U.S. Government.   
    
  

 (b) Parent and Acquisition acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, CSC may cause each of DTS and DI to enter into separate (i) Refund Agreements and (ii) agreements with KPMG pursuant to which DTS or DI, as the  
    
  

49  
    
    
  

case may be, will agree to pay KPMG, on a contingency basis, for any Texas
Sales Tax Refunds identified by KPMG to which DTS or DI, as applicable, is
entitled.  
    
  

 (c) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) DI shall be entitled to any Texas Sales Tax Refunds relating to DI and the other Dyn International Companies, including with respect to any Government Contract to which any of the Dyn International Companies is a party on or after the Closing Date, (ii) DTS shall be entitled to any Texas Sales Tax Refunds relating to DTS, (iii) with respect to any Texas Sales Tax Refunds that DI or any other Dyn International Company may receive, including with respect to any Government Contract to which any of the Dyn International Companies is a party on or after the Closing Date, DI shall be responsible for (A) any payment or credit that is determined by the DACO to be provided to the U.S. Government with respect thereto and (B) any payment that is required to be made to KPMG with respect thereto, and (iv) with respect to any Texas Sales Tax Refunds that DTS may receive, DTS shall be responsible for (A) any payment or credit that is determined by the DACO to be provided to the U.S. Government with respect thereto and (B) any payment that is required to be made to KPMG with respect thereto.  
    
  

 (d) In the event that DTS (or any other member of the Seller Group) receives any Texas Sales Tax Refund with respect to any sales or use tax that relates to any Government Contract that has been assigned by DTS (or any other member of the Seller Group) to DI or any of the other Dyn International Companies prior to the date hereof or pursuant to the Internal Alignment Transactions, then DTS (or such member of the Seller Group) shall promptly remit to DI the amount of such Texas Sales Tax Refund, net of any payment that is made by DTS to KPMG with respect thereto.

TAX MATTERS  
    
  

 Section 5.1. _Indemnification Obligations With Respect to Taxes_.  
    
  

 (a) CSC and the Seller shall pay, and indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent, Acquisition and the Dyn International Companies from and against (i) all income Taxes of the Dyn International Companies with respect to Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date and with respect to any Tax Period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") as allocated to CSC and the Seller pursuant to Section 5.1(b) ("Pre-Closing Tax Periods"). (ii) all income Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any of the Dyn International Companies is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, by reason of the liability of such Dyn International Company pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or any analogous or similar state, local or foreign law or regulation, (iii) subject to the survival period set forth in Section 7.1, all Losses (as defined in Section 7.2(a)) incurred by Acquisition or any other Acquisition Indemnified Party (as defined in Section 7.2(a)) arising out of or resulting from any breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.13(g), and (iv) all Taxes of the Dyn International Companies, other than income Taxes, with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, which are not reflected in the determination of the Final Working Capital Surplus or Final Working Capital Shortfall, as the case may be. CSC and the Seller shall be entitled to (i) any income Tax refund relating to the  
    
  

50  
    
    
  

Dyn International Companies for Tax periods ending on or before the Closing
Date and (ii) any other Tax refunds (other than Texas Sales Tax Refunds)
relating to the Dyn International Companies for Tax periods ending on or
before the Closing Date which are not reflected in the determination of the
Final Working Capital Surplus or Final Working Capital Shortfall, as the case
may be.. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 5.1(a) are
not subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.6 hereof.  
    
  

 (b) Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine any Taxes attributable to any Straddle Period shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of each Dyn International Company as of the close of the Closing Date and shall be allocated to the Seller and CSC for the portion of such Straddle Period from the first day of such Straddle Period through and including the Closing Date and to Acquisition from the day after the Closing Date through and including the last day of such Straddle Period, _provided, however_ , that exemptions, credits, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period.  
    
  

 (c) Acquisition shall reimburse CSC (or the Seller, as the case may be) for the Tax Benefit relating to any Taxes for which indemnification is provided under this Article 5. Tax Benefit is the actual reduction in federal income taxes of Acquisition or the Dyn International Companies resulting from the deduction of the Taxes to which the indemnity payment relates. For this purpose, it shall be assumed that all other deductions to which Acquisition or the Dyn International Companies are entitled are taken before the deduction for the indemnified Taxes at issue. The Tax Benefit shall be estimated in good faith and netted against the corresponding CSC indemnity payment at the time of such payment. The Tax Benefit shall be finally determined at the time Acquisition files the corresponding federal income Tax Return that includes the deduction for the Taxes subject to the indemnity payment, and the parties shall make appropriate payments based on the difference between the estimated and the actual Tax Benefit.  
    
  

 Section 5.2. _Tax Returns and Payment Responsibility_.   
    
  

 (a) CSC and the Seller will be responsible for and will cause to be prepared and duly filed all Tax Returns of the Dyn International Companies for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and shall file any and all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Acquisition shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns with respect to the Dyn International Companies, other than those that are the responsibility of CSC and the Seller pursuant to this paragraph. Not later than three days before the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any Tax Returns which Acquisition has the responsibility to file, CSC or the Seller shall pay to Acquisition an amount equal to that portion of the Taxes shown on such return for which CSC or the Seller has an obligation to indemnify Parent, Acquisition or the Dyn International Companies pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.1.  
    
  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Article 5 to the contrary, all sales, use, transfer and other similar Taxes, including any stock or asset transfer stamp Tax, arising from the Transactions, shall be paid one-half by CSC and one-half by Acquisition.  
    
  

51  
    
    
  

 Section 5.3. _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, CSC and the Seller, on the one hand, and Acquisition, on the other hand, shall (and shall cause their respective affiliates to): (a) assist the other party in timely preparing and filing any Tax Return or report that such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with this Article 5; (b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audit of, or dispute with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Return of the Dyn International Companies relating to taxable periods for which the other may have a liability under this Article 5; (c) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as reasonably requested by the other party all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the Dyn International Companies on a timely basis; (d) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment of the Dyn International Companies for taxable periods for which the other may have a liability under this Article 5; (e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect to any such taxable period described in this Section 5.3; and (f) act in good faith in all matters relating to the preparation of any Tax Return, the reporting, payment, audit, examination, contest, challenge or other proceedings or actions relating to the Taxes of the Dyn International Companies that may affect the liabilities of the other party either to a taxing authority or pursuant to this Agreement.  
    
  

 Section 5.4. _Retention of Records_. After the Closing Date, CSC, the Seller and Acquisition will, and Acquisition shall cause the Dyn International Companies to, preserve all information, records or documents relating to liabilities for Taxes of the Dyn International Companies until six months after the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations (including extensions thereof) with respect to the assessment of such Taxes.  
    
  

 Section 5.5. _Other Provisions_. The provisions of this Article 5 shall govern exclusively all indemnity claims with respect to Taxes of the Dyn International Companies pursuant to this Agreement.  
    
  

 Section 5.6. _Allocation of Price_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Acquisition and the Seller shall agree as to the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Dyn International Companies, and to the extent required by Law or any Tax elections, among the assets of the Dyn International Companies; _provided, however_ , that if, prior to Closing, Acquisition and the Seller are unable to agree, any disputed items shall be submitted to a mutually acceptable appraisal firm (the "Appraiser") for resolution, it being understood that the Appraiser\'s duty would be to resolve disputes regarding allocation of the Purchase Price and not to interpret or to resolve disputes over the proper interpretation of this Agreement. With respect to all items in dispute, Acquisition and the Seller shall each submit its proposed resolution and the Appraiser shall be instructed to determine which proposal results in the more accurate allocation of the Purchase Price and shall select one of the two proposals. The fees and expenses of the Appraiser shall be paid by the party whose position was not selected as resulting in the most accurate allocation pursuant to the preceding sentence. Thereafter, Acquisition and the Seller shall file all applicable Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the allocations agreed to by Acquisition and the Seller or determined by the Appraiser, as the case may be, and shall not take any positions inconsistent with such allocations unless required by Law.  
    
  

 Section 5.7 _Conduct of Proceedings_. If, subsequent to the Closing, Acquisition or the Dyn International Companies receive notice of any audit, other administrative proceeding or  
    
  

52  
    
    
  

inquiry or judicial proceeding involving Taxes (a "Tax Contest") with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that Acquisition believes, in good faith, may
result in an indemnification pursuant to Section 5.1, Acquisition shall
promptly notify CSC of such Tax Contest. CSC shall have the right to conduct
and control the Tax Contest. Acquisition shall be entitled to participate in
the Tax Contest at its own expense. CSC shall control the resolution of any
such Tax Contest, but shall not without the consent of Acquisition, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or denied, settle such Tax Contest
if such settlement would materially increase the Tax liability of the
Acquisition or the Dyn International Companies for Tax periods or portions
thereof after the Closing Date.   
    
  

 Section 5.8 _Amended Returns_. Acquisition and the Dyn International Companies shall not without CSC\'s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or denied, file any Tax Returns or amended Tax Returns with respect to the Dyn International Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

 (4) Any liability arising out of or resulting from the failure of any notice period applicable to any Contract Notification to have expired prior to the Closing Date, to the extent such failure does not arise out of or result from the breach or non-performance by CSC or Seller of their obligations set forth in Section 4.11(b)(ii);  
    
  

 (5) Any liability arising out of or resulting from the Conversion Novations, to the extent such liability does not arise out of or result from the breach or non-performance by CSC or Seller of their obligations set forth in Section 4.11(b)(iii); and

 (a) Except with respect to claims related to Taxes, which are covered by Article 5 and the Arias Litigation which is covered by the Joint Defense Agreement, if any Proceeding at Law or in equity is instituted by a third party against an Indemnified Party (each, a "Third Party Claim") with respect to which an Indemnified Party intends to claim indemnification for any Losses under this Article 7, such Indemnified Party shall give written notice to the Indemnitors within 30 days after it has knowledge of a written assertion of liability from the third party and shall not make any admissions or acceptances; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not be foreclosed from seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article 7 as a result of any failure to provide timely notice of the existence of such Third Party Claim to the Indemnitors except and only to the extent that any Indemnitor has been materially damaged or prejudiced as a result of such delay.  
    
  

 (b) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Indemnitors shall have the right to conduct and control, at their own expense, through counsel of its choosing (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), the defense of a Third Party Claim so long as the Indemnitors notify the Indemnified Party that they have agreed to indemnify the Indemnified Party (subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth herein) for any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from the Third Party Claim that it is assuming the right to conduct and control the defense of within 15 business days of its receipt of the initial notice of the Third Party Claim, and shall do so vigorously and in good faith; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate at its own expense, with counsel of its choosing, in the defense of such third party action or suit although such action or suit shall be controlled by the Indemnitors.

 (c) Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnitors shall settle any Third Party Claim without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be  
    
  

60  
    
    
  

unreasonably withheld. Any compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim
under this Section 7.5 shall include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant in question to the Indemnitors and the Indemnified
Party of a release of all liabilities in respect of such claims.  
    
  

 Section 7.6. _Limitation on Indemnity_.  
    
  

 (a) _Time Limitations_. Claims for indemnification made under Section 7.2(a)(1), Section 7.2(b)(1) or Section 7.2(c) of this Agreement may be made only during the survival period set forth in Section 7.1.  
    
  

 (b) _Deductible_. CSC and the Seller shall not be liable to indemnify any Acquisition Indemnified Party pursuant to (1) Section 7.2(a)(1) of this Agreement or (2) Section 7.2(a)(2) of this Agreement with respect to a breach by CSC or the Seller of their obligations under Section 4.14, and Acquisition shall not be liable to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 7.2(b)(1), unless and until the Acquisition Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, have suffered aggregate Losses otherwise indemnifiable pursuant to this Article 7 in excess of a $5,000,000 aggregate deductible (the "Deductible") (at which point, subject to the other limitations herein, CSC and the Seller will be liable to the Acquisition Indemnified Parties for all Losses in excess of such Deductible, and Acquisition will be liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for all Losses in excess of such Deductible, as the case may be); _provided, however_ , anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, where the aggregate amount of Losses arising out of a single claim or series of related claims for which any Acquisition Indemnified Party or any Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be, could otherwise seek indemnification under this Article 7 does not exceed $50,000 (the "Minimum Claim Threshold"), such claim or series of related claims shall not count towards the Deductible as Losses for purposes of, or otherwise be subject to indemnification under, this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Deductible and the Minimum Claim Threshold shall not apply to breaches of the Ownership Representations or Broker Representations.  
    
  

 (c) _Cap_. Neither (i) the aggregate amount of all payments to be made by CSC and the Seller in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to this Article 7 nor (ii) the aggregate amount of all payments to be made by Acquisition in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to this Article 7, shall exceed $50,000,000 (the "Cap"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Cap shall not apply to breaches of the Ownership Representations or Broker Representations.  
    
  

 (d) _Reimbursable Claims_. The Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable best efforts, consistent with and no less diligent than such party\'s past practice, to obtain under any applicable Contract (including, without limitation, any applicable Contract with the United States Department of State) any indemnification proceeds or other right of reimbursement or recovery in respect of any claim for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Article 7. The amount of any indemnified Losses hereunder shall be determined net of the amount, if any, of the recovery actually received by the Indemnified Party with respect to such indemnified Losses under any such Contract or arrangement. In the event that a recovery is received pursuant to any such Contract or arrangement by an Indemnified Party  
    
  

61  
    
    
  

with respect to any Loss for which any Indemnified Party has previously been
indemnified by the Indemnitors pursuant hereto, then such Indemnified Party
shall promptly make a refund to the Indemnitors an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) the total amount of such recovery, and (ii) the amount previously paid
by the Indemnitors to the Indemnified Party as indemnification for such
Loss.  
    
  

 (e) _Insured Claims_. The Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable efforts, consistent with such party\'s past practice, to obtain under any applicable insurance policies any insurance proceeds in respect of any claim for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Article 7. The amount of any indemnified Losses hereunder shall be determined net of the amount, if any, of the recovery actually received by the Indemnified Party with respect to such indemnified Losses under any such insurance or similar policy less (i) any reasonable out-of-pocket collection costs; (ii) any amount which is reimbursed by the Indemnified Party or an affiliate thereof, directly or indirectly, that is charged back to the Indemnified Party or an affiliate thereof or that is not otherwise received for the permanent benefit of the Indemnified Party (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 4.16); and (iii) any other reasonable out-of-pocket cost which may reasonably be borne by the Indemnified Party or an affiliate thereof as a result of such insurance claim or recovery, whether as a result of any self-insurance arrangement, retention amount, deductible amount or otherwise. The Indemnitor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Indemnified Party to recover amounts under insurance policies or other rights of the Indemnified Party (including the Dyn International Companies) with respect to such indemnified amount and, in the event that an insurance recovery is received by an Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which any Indemnified Party has previously been indemnified by the Indemnitor pursuant hereto, then such Indemnified shall promptly make a refund to the Indemnitor an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of such insurance recovery (net of any reasonable out-of-pocket collection costs), and (ii) the amount previously paid by the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party as indemnification for such Loss.  
    
  

 (f) _Tax Benefits_. Acquisition shall reimburse CSC (or the Seller, as the case may be) for the Tax Benefit relating to the Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article 7. Tax Benefit is the actual reduction in federal income taxes of Acquisition or the Dyn International Companies resulting from the deduction of the Losses to which the indemnity payment relates. For this purpose, it shall be assumed that all other deductions to which Acquisition or the Dyn International Companies are entitled are taken before the deduction for the Losses at issue. The Tax Benefit shall be estimated in good faith and netted against the corresponding indemnity payment made to Acquisition at the time of such payment. The Tax Benefit shall be finally determined at the time Acquisition files the corresponding federal income Tax Return that includes the Loss, and the parties shall make appropriate payments based on the difference between the estimated and the actual Tax Benefit.  
    
  

 (g) _Reserves_. The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided pursuant to this Article 7 shall be determined net of (i) any reserves, liability accruals or other provisions for such Losses reflected in the 2004 Balance Sheet and (ii) any amounts that were taken into account in the calculation of the Stock Component pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent that such amounts (i) related to the subject matter that gave rise to the Loss and (ii) were in the favor of the Indemnified Party.  
    
  

62  
    
    
  

 Section 7.7. _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The Seller and Acquisition agree to treat any payments in respect of indemnity Losses pursuant to Article 5 or this Article 7 as adjustments to the Purchase Price.  
    
  

 Section 7.8. _Exclusive Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, following the Closing, the remedies in this Article 7 shall be the exclusive remedies of the parties with respect to any and all matters covered by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the remedies in Article 5 shall be the exclusive remedies of the parties with respect to any and all matters covered by Article 5, and (ii) no party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any rights, claims, causes of action or remedies if and to the extent such rights, claims, causes of action or remedies may not be waived under Law or intentional fraud or willful misconduct is proven on the part of a party by another party hereto. No party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement or otherwise for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or any Schedule, certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
