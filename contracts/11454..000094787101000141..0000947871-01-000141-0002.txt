This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of the 16 day of March, 2001, by and among AABB Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), AmeriSource Health Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("AmeriSource"), Bergen Brunswig Corporation, a New
Jersey corporation ("Bergen"), A-Sub Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("AmeriSource Merger
Sub"), and B-Sub Acquisition Corp., a New Jersey corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Bergen Merger Sub" and, together with
AmeriSource Merger Sub, the "Merger Subsidiaries").   WITNESSETH  
WHEREAS, the boards of directors of AmeriSource and Bergen have determined
that it is consistent with and in furtherance of their respective long-term
business strategies and fair to and in the best interests of their respective
companies and shareholders to combine their respective businesses in a
"merger-of-equals" transaction so that their businesses will be conducted
as direct subsidiaries of Parent as set forth in this Agreement
(the "Reorganization");   WHEREAS, in effectuation of the foregoing, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance
with the Business Corporation Act of the State of New Jersey (the "NJBCA")
and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Parent
will acquire all of the common stock of each of AmeriSource and Bergen
through the merger of AmeriSource Merger Sub with and into AmeriSource and
the merger of Bergen Merger Sub with and into Bergen and the shareholders of
each of AmeriSource and Bergen will receive shares of common stock of Parent
in respect of their interests in AmeriSource and Bergen, respectively;  
WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the board of directors of each of Bergen,
AmeriSource, Parent, AmeriSource Merger Sub, and Bergen Merger Sub
has approved this Agreement and the applicable merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS,
AmeriSource and Bergen have organized Parent and have caused Parent to issue
to each of them 50% of its outstanding capital stock;   WHEREAS, Parent as
sole shareholder of each of the Merger Subsidiaries has executed written
consents in accordance with the NJBCA and the DGCL approving and adopting
this Agreement;   WHEREAS, as a result of the merger of AmeriSource Merger
Sub with and into AmeriSource and the merger of Bergen Merger Sub with and
into Bergen, (i) AmeriSource will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent,
(ii) Bergen will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, (iii) the
shareholders of AmeriSource will become shareholders of Parent and (iv) the
shareholders of Bergen will become shareholders of Parent;   WHEREAS, the
parties intend that none of Bergen, AmeriSource, the Bergen shareholders or
the AmeriSource shareholders will recognize any gain or loss for federal
income   tax purposes as a result of the Reorganization, except to the
extent that cash may be received in lieu of fractional shares and to the
extent of payments made pursuant to Section 6.1(i); and   WHEREAS, the
parties intend that the Reorganization be accounted for as a purchase
transaction for financial accounting purposes.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I   PARENT AND MERGER SUBSIDIARIES   1.1.
Organization of Parent. AmeriSource and Bergen have caused Parent to be
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. The authorized
capital stock of Parent consists of 100 shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the "Parent Common Stock"), of which 50 shares have been
issued to AmeriSource and 50 shares have been issued to Bergen. AmeriSource
and Bergen shall take, and shall cause Parent to take, all requisite action
to cause the certificate of incorporation of Parent to be duly adopted
substantially in the form of Exhibit A (the "Parent Certificate of
Incorporation") and the bylaws of Parent to be duly adopted substantially in
the form of Exhibit B (the "Parent Bylaws"), in each case, at the Effective
Time until thereafter changed or amended thereon, as provided therein, or by
Applicable Laws (as defined in Section 4.9).   1.2. Directors and Officers
of Parent. Prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2), the
directors and officers of Parent shall consist of equal numbers of
representatives of AmeriSource and Bergen as designated and elected by
AmeriSource and Bergen. AmeriSource and Bergen shall take all requisite
action to cause the directors and officers of Parent, as of the Effective
Time, to be as provided in Section 6.1(e). Each such director and officer
shall remain in office until his or her successors are elected in accordance
with Applicable Law, the Parent Certificate of Incorporation and the Parent
Bylaws.   1.3. Formation of Merger Subsidiaries. Parent has formed
AmeriSource Merger Sub and Bergen Merger Sub under the DGCL and the NJBCA,
respectively, as wholly owned subsidiaries of Parent. Each of the Merger
Subsidiaries has been formed solely to facilitate the Mergers (as defined in
Section 2.1) and shall conduct no business or activity other than in
connection with the Mergers.   1.4. Headquarters of Parent. At the Effective
Time, the Corporate Headquarters and Eastern Management Center of Parent
shall be the headquarters and principal executive offices of AmeriSource
located in Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania, and the Western Management Center and
MIS Center and the Headquarters of E-Commerce Operations of Parent shall be
the headquarters and principal executive offices of Bergen located in Orange
County, California.   1.5. Actions of AmeriSource and Bergen. AmeriSource
and Bergen, as the holders of all the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock, have approved this Agreement and Parent, as the sole shareholder of
each of the Merger Subsidiaries, has approved and adopted this   
2   Agreement under Section 228 of the DGCL and Section 14A:5-6 of the
NJBCA. Each of AmeriSource and Bergen shall cause Parent, and Parent shall
cause the Merger Subsidiaries, to perform their respective obligations under
this Agreement.   ARTICLE II   THE MERGERS   2.1. The Mergers.   (a)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, AmeriSource Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into AmeriSource (the "AmeriSource Merger"). As a
result of the AmeriSource Merger, the separate corporate existence
of AmeriSource Merger Sub shall cease and AmeriSource shall continue as
the surviving corporation of the AmeriSource Merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (the "AmeriSource Surviving Corporation").   (b) Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in
accordance with the NJBCA, at the Effective Time, Bergen Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into Bergen (the "Bergen Merger" and, together, with the
AmeriSource Merger, the "Mergers"). As a result of the Bergen Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Bergen Merger Sub shall cease and Bergen
shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Bergen Merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Bergen Surviving Corporation"; either
of AmeriSource Surviving Corporation or Bergen Surviving Corporation
being separately referred to as a "Surviving Corporation", and collectively
referred to as the "Surviving Corporations").   2.2. Effective Time;
Closing.   (a) Concurrently with the Closing (as defined in Section 2.2(b)),
the parties shall cause the Mergers to be consummated by (i) in the case of
the Bergen Merger, filing with the Department of the Treasury of the State of
New Jersey (the "New Jersey Treasury Department") a certificate of merger
(the "New Jersey Certificate of Merger") in accordance with Section
14A:10-4.1 of the NJBCA and (ii) in the case of the AmeriSource Merger,
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware
Secretary of State") a certificate of merger (the "Delaware Certificate of
Merger") in accordance with Section 252 of the DGCL. The Mergers shall become
effective (the "Effective Time") (x) when (i) the New Jersey Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the New Jersey Treasury Department and (ii)
the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State or (y) at such later time as shall be agreed upon by
AmeriSource and Bergen and specified in the New Jersey Certificate of Merger
and the Delaware Certificate of Merger.   (b) Subject to the satisfaction
or, if permissible, waiver of the other conditions set forth in Article VII
of this Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Closing") shall be held at the offices of Dechert, 4000 Bell Atlantic Tower,
1717 Arch Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at 10:00 a.m. New York City
time on the third business day following the latest of: (i) the date on which
the AmeriSource Shareholders Meeting (as defined in Section 6.2(a))
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof) shall have been held,
(ii)   3   the date on which the Bergen Shareholders Meeting (as defined
in Section 6.3(a)) (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) shall
have been held, (iii) the date on which the condition set forth in Section
7.1(b) shall have been satisfied or waived, (iv) the date on which the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(e) shall have been satisfied or waived,
(v) the date on which the condition set forth in Section 7.1(f) shall have
been satisfied or waived and (vi) the date on which the condition set forth
in Section 7.1(g) shall have been satisfied or waived; or at such other place
or time or on such other date as AmeriSource and Bergen may agree. The date
on which the Closing will take place is referred to herein as the "Closing
Date."   2.3. Effects of the Mergers. From and after the Effective Time, the
Mergers shall have the effects set forth in the NJBCA and the DGCL, as
applicable. As of the Effective Time, each of the Surviving Corporations
shall be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.   2.4. Certificates of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporations.   (a) At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the AmeriSource Merger, the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of AmeriSource Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated such that they are substantially in the form of the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of AmeriSource Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of AmeriSource Surviving
Corporation shall be AmeriSource Health Corporation.   (b) At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Bergen Merger, the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of Bergen Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated such
that they are substantially in the form of the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of Bergen Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that the name of Bergen Surviving Corporation shall be Bergen Brunswig
Corporation.   2.5. Directors and Officers of the Surviving
Corporations.   (a) The officers of each of AmeriSource and Bergen
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to serve in their
respective offices of their respective Surviving Corporations from and after
the Effective Time, in each case until their successors are elected or
appointed and qualified or until their resignation or removal. If, at the
Effective Time, a vacancy shall exist in any office of either of the
Surviving Corporations, such vacancy may thereafter be filled in the manner
provided by Applicable Law and the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
such Surviving Corporation.   (b) The directors of each of AmeriSource
Merger Sub and Bergen Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall continue to serve as the directors of their respective Surviving
Corporations from and after the Effective Time, in each case until their
successors are elected or appointed and qualified or until their resignation
or removal. If, at the Effective Time, a vacancy shall exist on the Board of
Directors of either of the Surviving Corporations, such vacancy may
thereafter be filled in the manner provided by Applicable Law and the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of such Surviving Corporation.  
2.6. Tax Reorganization. In the event that either of the
opinions contemplated by Section 7.2(d) or Section 7.3(d) cannot reasonably
be rendered, the parties agree to promptly    4   amend this Agreement
to provide for the simultaneous merger of AmeriSource and Bergen with and
into Parent, with Parent as the surviving corporation in each merger;
provided, however, that the parties shall be under no such obligation
to amend this Agreement if (i) either of such opinions cannot reasonably
be rendered despite such amendments or (ii) if the merger described in this
Section 2.6 would result in an inaccuracy or omission in the representations
and warranties contained in Section 4.5 or 5.5 that is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource or Bergen or a material adverse
effect on the ability of AmeriSource or Bergen to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, further that no representation or warranty
made by a party in this Agreement shall be deemed breached to the extent such
merger of AmeriSource and Bergen with and into Parent results in an
inaccuracy or omission in such representation or warranty or a corresponding
section of the Disclosure Schedule.   ARTICLE III   CONVERSION OF
SECURITIES   3.1. Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Mergers and without any action on the part of AmeriSource or
Bergen or their respective shareholders:   (a) Subject to the other
provisions of this Article III, each share of Bergen Common Stock (as defined
in Section 4.4) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than those cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b)), shall be
converted into and represent 0.37 (the "Bergen Exchange Ratio") shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent together with any
corresponding associated rights (if such rights have been issued to holders
of Parent Common Stock) issued pursuant to the Parent Rights Agreement (as
defined in Section 6.1(j)). Subject to the other provisions of this Article
III, as of the Effective Time, each such share of Bergen Common Stock shall,
by virtue of the Bergen Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be
cancelled and retired, and each holder of a certificate representing any
such shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto
except the right to receive (i) certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares have been converted,
(ii) certain dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section
3.3(c) and (iii) cash in lieu of Fractional Shares (as defined in Section
3.2(b)) of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.2, without
interest.   (b) Each share of capital stock of Bergen held in the treasury
of Bergen and each share of capital stock of Bergen owned by AmeriSource or
any direct or indirect wholly owed subsidiary of AmeriSource immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and no payment
shall be made in respect thereof.   (c) Subject to the other provisions of
this Article III, each share of AmeriSource Common Stock (as defined in
Section 5.4) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than those cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(d)), shall be converted
into and represent one (the "AmeriSource Exchange Ratio") share of Parent
Common Stock together with any corresponding associated rights (if such
rights have been issued to holders of Parent Common Stock) issued pursuant to
the Parent Rights Agreement. Subject to the other provisions of this Article
III, as of the Effective Time, each such share of AmeriSource   
5   Common Stock shall, by virtue of the AmeriSource Merger, cease to be
outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect thereto except the right to receive (i) certificates
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which
such shares have been converted and (ii) certain dividends and other
distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(c).   (d) Each share of
capital stock of AmeriSource held in the treasury of AmeriSource and each
share of capital stock of AmeriSource owned by Bergen or any direct or
indirect wholly owed subsidiary of Bergen immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and retired and no payment shall be made in respect
thereof.   (e) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of AmeriSource Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and all rights in respect thereof, shall,
without any action on the part of Parent, forthwith cease to exist and be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AmeriSource Surviving
Corporation.   (f) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Bergen Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and all rights in respect thereof,
shall, without any action on the part of Parent, forthwith cease to exist and
be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Bergen Surviving Corporation.  
3.2. Fractional Shares; Adjustments.   (a) No certificates representing
Fractional Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Bergen
Common Stock certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Bergen
Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any
rights of a stockholder of Parent.   (b) As promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the total
number of Fractional Shares of Parent that Bergen shareholders would be
entitled to receive (such Fractional Shares being herein called the
"Fractional Shares"). As soon after the Effective Time as practicable, the
Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of Fractional Shares shall sell the
Fractional Shares at then prevailing prices on the NYSE all in the manner
provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 3.2.   (c) The sale of the
Fractional Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through
one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to
the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use all reasonable efforts
to complete the sale of the Fractional Shares as promptly following the
Effective Time as, in the Exchange Agent\'s reasonable judgment,
is practicable consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in
light of prevailing market conditions. Until the net proceeds of any such
sale or sales have been distributed to such holders of Bergen Common Stock,
the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such holders of
Bergen Common Stock. Parent shall pay all    6   commissions, transfer
taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs of the Exchange Agent
incurred in connection with such sale or sales of Fractional Shares. In
addition, Parent shall pay the Exchange Agent\'s compensation and expenses in
connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange Agent shall determine the
portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of Bergen Common Stock
shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate
net proceeds by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the
fractional share interest to which such holder of Bergen Common Stock is
entitled (after taking into account all shares of Bergen Common Stock then
held by such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of certificates representing
Bergen Common Stock are entitled.   (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of
this Section 3.2, Parent may elect, at its option, exercised prior to the
Effective Time and in lieu of the issuance and sale of Fractional Shares and
the making of the payments contemplated in such subsections, to pay to the
Exchange Agent an amount in cash sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay
each holder of Bergen Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of
Bergen Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) by (ii) the
closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange (the "NYSE") on the first business day immediately following the
Effective Time.   (e) Any payment with respect to Fractional Shares is
merely intended to provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not a
separately bargained for, consideration. If more than one certificate
representing shares of Bergen Common Stock shall be surrendered for the
account of the same holder, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
which certificates have been surrendered shall be computed on the basis of
the aggregate number of shares represented by the certificates so
surrendered. Any payment owed with respect to the Fractional Shares shall be
rounded upward to the nearest cent. As soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
Bergen Common Stock with respect to any Fractional Share interests, the
Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts to such holders of Bergen
Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3.   (f) If, prior to the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of AmeriSource Common Stock or Bergen Common
Stock as a class shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or class of shares or securities as a result
of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend,
stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares or other
similar change in capitalization, then an appropriate and proportionate
adjustment shall be made to the Bergen Exchange Ratio; provided that no
adjustment shall be made as a result of the distribution of common stock
purchase rights ("AmeriSource Rights") pursuant to the AmeriSource Rights
Agreement (as defined in Section 5.4) to the holders of AmeriSource Class A
Common Stock prior to the Effective Time.   3.3. Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Promptly following the Effective Time
(but in no event later than three business days after the Effective Time),
Parent shall deposit with Mellon Investor Services L.L.C. or such other
exchange agent as may be designated by Parent (the "Exchange   
7   Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of AmeriSource Common Stock and
Bergen Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3,
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 3.1(a) or (c) in exchange for outstanding shares of Bergen Common
Stock and AmeriSource Common Stock and shall from time to time deposit cash
in an amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.2 (such shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund").   (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than three business days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of AmeriSource Common Stock
or Bergen Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(a) or (c)
("Certificates"), (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify, including offering holders of Certificates the ability to hold their
shares of Parent Common Stock in book entry form in lieu of the certificates
provided for below) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash in lieu of any Fractional Shares. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate or certificates
representing that whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a) or (c) in such
denominations and registered in such names as such holder may request and (y)
a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of Fractional Shares, if any,
and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, after
giving effect to any required withholding tax. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the cash in lieu of Fractional Shares, if any, and unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of shares of
AmeriSource Common Stock or Bergen Common Stock. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of AmeriSource Common Stock or Bergen Common Stock
which is not registered on the transfer records of AmeriSource or Bergen, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
together with a check for the cash to be paid in lieu of Fractional Shares,
if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of AmeriSource Common
Stock or Bergen Common Stock held by such transferee is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid.   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to any
shares of Parent Common Stock having a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash
payment in lieu of Fractional Shares shall be paid to any such holder, until
the holder shall surrender such Certificate as provided in this Section 3.3.
Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws, there shall be paid to the holder
of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common
Stock      8   issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at
the time of surrender of such Certificate, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid, less
the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date subsequent to surrender of such Certificate,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock,
less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon.  
(d) No Further Ownership Rights in AmeriSource Common Stock or Bergen Common
Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon surrender
of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
paid pursuant to this Article III) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of AmeriSource
Common Stock or Bergen Common Stock represented thereby, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
AmeriSource or Bergen of shares of AmeriSource Common Stock or Bergen Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. All Certificates
presented to Parent after the Effective Time for any reason shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 3.3. Certificates
surrendered for exchange by any person constituting an "affiliate" of
AmeriSource or Bergen for purposes of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the
"Securities Act"), shall not be exchanged until Parent has received written
undertakings from such person in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C in the
case of affiliates of AmeriSource or Exhibit D in the case of affiliates of
Bergen.   (e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to holders of AmeriSource Common Stock or
Bergen Common Stock one year after the date of the mailing required by
Section 3.3(b) shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand therefor, and
holders of Certificates previously representing shares of AmeriSource Common
Stock or Bergen Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
Section 3.3 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of any claim to
shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of Fractional Shares, or
dividends or distributions, if any, in respect thereof.   (f) No Liability.
None of Parent, AmeriSource, Bergen or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to
seven years after the Effective Time of the Mergers (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which any shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, or any cash in lieu of Fractional
Shares in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 4.5)), any
such shares, dividends or distributions or cash in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.   (g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other   
9   income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon
termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 3.3(e); provided that
nothing herein shall limit Parent\'s obligation to ensure that an amount of
cash sufficient to pay all amounts due holders of Certificates upon surrender
to the Exchange Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Article III.   (h)
Missing Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
and providing an appropriate indemnity or surety bond by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares
of Parent Common Stock (including dividends and distributions with respect
thereto) and cash in lieu of Fractional Shares deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.   3.4. Treatment of Stock Options.   (a)
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, AmeriSource and Bergen shall take all
such actions as may be necessary to cause each unexpired and unexercised
option under stock option plans of AmeriSource and Bergen in effect on the
date hereof which has been granted to current or former directors, officers,
employees or consultants of AmeriSource or Bergen by AmeriSource or Bergen
(or which has been granted by AmeriSource or Bergen prior to the Effective
Time in compliance with the terms of this Agreement) (each such option an
"AmeriSource Option" or a "Bergen Option," as the case may be) to
be automatically converted at the Effective Time into an option (a "Parent
Exchange Option") to purchase that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(i) in the case of a Bergen Option, equal to the number of shares of Bergen
Common Stock issuable immediately prior to the Effective Time upon exercise
of the Bergen Option (without regard to actual restrictions on
exercisability) multiplied by the Bergen Exchange Ratio, with an exercise
price equal to the exercise price which existed under the corresponding
Bergen Option divided by the Bergen Exchange Ratio, and with other terms and
conditions that are the same as the terms and conditions of such Bergen
Option immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) in the case of an
AmeriSource Option, equal to the number of shares of AmeriSource Common Stock
issuable immediately prior to the Effective Time upon exercise of the
AmeriSource Option (without regard to actual restrictions on exercisability),
with an exercise price equal to the exercise price which existed under the
corresponding AmeriSource Option, and with other terms and conditions that
are the same as the terms and conditions of such AmeriSource Option
immediately before the Effective Time; provided, that with respect to
any AmeriSource Option or Bergen Option that is an "incentive stock option"
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), the foregoing conversion shall be carried out in a
manner satisfying the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. In
connection with the issuance of Parent Exchange Options, Parent shall (i)
reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will
become subject to Parent Exchange Options pursuant to this Section 3.4 and
(ii) from and after the Effective Time, upon exercise of Parent Exchange
Options, make available for issuance all shares of Parent Common Stock
covered thereby, subject to the terms and conditions applicable thereto.  
(b) AmeriSource and Bergen each agree to issue treasury shares of AmeriSource
or Bergen, to the extent available, upon the exercise of AmeriSource Options
or Bergen Options prior to the Effective Time.   10    (c) Parent agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") within five business days after the Closing
Date a registration statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form under the
Securities Act to register the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Parent Exchange Options and use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such registration statement to remain effective until the exercise
or expiration of all such options.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF BERGEN   In order to induce AmeriSource to enter into this
Agreement, Bergen hereby represents and warrants to AmeriSource that the
statements contained in this Article IV are true, correct and complete.  
4.1. Organization and Standing Each of Bergen and each subsidiary (as defined
in Section 9.3) of Bergen is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation
with full corporate power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its
properties and to conduct its business as and where now owned, leased, used,
operated and conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing
or in good standing or to have such corporate power or authority,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.3) on Bergen. Each of Bergen
and each subsidiary of Bergen is duly qualified to do business and in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the property it owns, leases or operates requires it to so
qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing in
such jurisdiction individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Bergen. Bergen is not in
default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any provision of its
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or its Bylaws, each as in effect on the
date hereof (the "Bergen Certificate" and the "Bergen Bylaws," respectively).
Bergen has heretofore furnished to AmeriSource a complete and correct copy of
the Bergen Certificate and the Bergen Bylaws. No subsidiary of Bergen is in
default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any provision of
such subsidiary\'s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, each as in effect
on the date hereof.   4.2. Subsidiaries. Bergen does not own, directly or
indirectly, any equity or other ownership interest in any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other entity or enterprise, except for the
subsidiaries and other entities set forth in Section 4.2 to the disclosure
schedule delivered by Bergen to AmeriSource and dated the date hereof (the
"Bergen Disclosure Schedule"). Except as set forth in Section 4.2 to the
Bergen Disclosure Schedule, neither Bergen nor any of its subsidiaries is
subject to any obligation or requirement to provide funds to or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in an
amount in excess of $1,000,000 in any entity or enterprise that is not wholly
owned by Bergen. Except as set forth in Section 4.2 to the Bergen Disclosure
Schedule, Bergen owns directly or indirectly each of the outstanding shares
of capital stock (or other ownership interests having by their terms ordinary
voting power to elect a majority of directors or others performing similar
functions with respect to such subsidiary) of each of Bergen\'s subsidiaries,
free and clear of all liens, pledges, security interests, claims or other
encumbrances. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each    
11   of Bergen\'s subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable. Other than as set forth in Section 4.2 to the Bergen
Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, puts, calls, agreements, understandings, claims or other
commitments or rights of any type relating to the issuance, sale, repurchase
or transfer of any capital stock or other securities of any subsidiary of
Bergen, nor are there outstanding any securities which are convertible into
or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock or other securities of any
subsidiary of Bergen, and neither Bergen nor any subsidiary of Bergen has any
obligation of any kind to issue any additional shares of capital stock or
other securities of any subsidiary of Bergen or to pay for or repurchase any
shares of capital stock or other securities of any subsidiary of Bergen or
any predecessor thereof.   4.3. Corporate Power and Authority. Bergen has
all requisite corporate power and authority to (a) enter into and deliver
this Agreement, (b) to perform its obligations hereunder, and, (c) subject to
obtaining the requisite approval of the shareholders of Bergen of this
Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Bergen have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Bergen,
subject to obtaining the requisite approval of the shareholders of Bergen.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Bergen and (assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto)
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Bergen enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms.   4.4. Capitalization of Bergen. As
of March 15, 2001, Bergen\'s authorized capital stock consisted solely of (a)
300,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $1.50 per share
("Bergen Common Stock"), of which (i) 135,484,524 shares were issued and
outstanding, (ii) 3,110,673 shares were issued and held in treasury (which
does not include the shares reserved for issuance set forth in clause (iii)
below) and no shares were held by subsidiaries of Bergen, and (iii) 9,034,384
shares were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options
and no shares were reserved for issuance upon the conversion or exchange of
convertible or exchangeable securities granted or issued by Bergen; and (b)
3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value ("Bergen Preferred
Stock"), none of which was issued and outstanding or reserved for issuance,
except for a series of 400,000 shares of Bergen Preferred Stock designated as
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock reserved for issuance pursuant
to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of December 17, 1999
between Bergen and ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, Inc. ("Bergen Rights
Agreement"), none of which was issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share
of Bergen capital stock is duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and has not been issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights. Other than as set forth in the first sentence hereof, in
Section 4.4 to the Bergen Disclosure Schedule or as contemplated by the Stock
Option Agreement dated as of the date hereof between AmeriSource and Bergen
(the "Bergen Stock Option Agreement"), there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, agreements, understandings,
claims or other commitments or rights of any type relating to the issuance,
sale, repurchase or transfer by Bergen of any securities of Bergen, nor are
there outstanding any securities which are convertible into or exchangeable
for any shares of capital stock of Bergen, and neither Bergen nor any
subsidiary of Bergen has any obligation of any kind to issue any
additional securities or to pay for or repurchase any securities of Bergen or
any predecessor. The Bergen Disclosure Schedule accurately sets forth as
of March 15, 2001 the names of, and the number of shares of     
12   each class (including the number of shares issuable upon exercise of
Bergen Options and the exercise price and vesting schedule with respect
thereto) and the number of options held by, all holders of options to
purchase Bergen capital stock. Except as set forth in Section 4.4 to the
Bergen Disclosure Schedule, neither Bergen nor any of its subsidiaries has
any agreement, arrangement or understandings to register any securities of
Bergen or any of its subsidiaries under the Securities Act or under any state
securities law or has granted registration rights to any person or entity
(other than agreements, arrangements or understandings with respect to
registration rights that are no longer in effect as of the date of this
Agreement); copies of all such agreements (other than agreements that are no
longer in effect on the date of this Agreement) have previously been provided
to AmeriSource.   4.5. Conflicts; Consents and Approvals. Except as set
forth in Section 4.5 to the Bergen Disclosure Schedule and, in the case of
(b), (c) and (d), for any of the following that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Bergen or a material adverse effect on the ability of Bergen to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Bergen Stock Option Agreement by Bergen, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will:   (a)
conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, the Bergen
Certificate or the Bergen Bylaws,   (b) to the knowledge of Bergen, violate,
or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a
default (or an event which, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or
otherwise, would constitute a default) under, or entitle any party (with the
giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise) to terminate, accelerate,
modify or call a default under, or result in the creation of any lien,
security interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets
of Bergen or any of its subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
contract, undertaking, agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to
which Bergen or any of its subsidiaries is a party,   (c) violate any
order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, permit, license, rule or regulation
applicable to Bergen or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, or   (d) require any action or consent or approval of,
or review by, or registration or filing by Bergen or any of its affiliates
with, any third party or any local, domestic, foreign or multi-national
court, tribunal, administrative agency or commission or other governmental or
regulatory body, agency, instrumentality or authority (a "Governmental
Authority"), other than (i) approval of the Mergers and the transactions

Site Recovery Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
("ISRA") and (vi) registrations or other actions required under federal and
state securities laws as are contemplated by this Agreement.   4.6. No
Material Adverse Change. Except (a) as set forth in Section 4.6 to the Bergen
Disclosure Schedule or (b) as specifically disclosed in the Bergen SEC
Documents (as defined in Section 4.7) filed with the Commission prior to
the date of this Agreement, since September 30, 2000, there has been no
change in the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of Bergen or any of its subsidiaries which individually
or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Bergen, or any event, occurrence or development which individually
or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Bergen to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   4.7. Bergen
SEC Documents. Except as set forth in Section 4.7 to the Bergen Disclosure
Schedule, Bergen has timely filed with the Commission all forms, reports,
schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed by them since
December 31, 1997 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the "Exchange
Act") or the Securities Act (such documents, as supplemented and amended
since the time of filing, collectively, the "Bergen SEC Documents"). The
Bergen SEC Documents, including, without limitation, any financial statements
or schedules included therein, at the time filed (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of mailing, respectively) (a) did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (b)
except as set forth in Section 4.7 to the Bergen Disclosure Schedule,
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. The financial
statements of Bergen included in the Bergen SEC Documents at the time filed
(and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the
dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively) complied as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect
thereto, were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Commission), and fairly present
(subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to
normal, recurring audit adjustments), in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Bergen and its consolidated subsidiaries
as at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended. No subsidiary of Bergen is subject to
the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or required to file
any form, report or other document with the Commission, the NYSE, any other
stock exchange or any other comparable Governmental Authority.   4.8.
Taxes. Except as reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of Bergen as of
September 30, 2000, included in the Bergen SEC Documents, or disclosed in the
footnotes to the financial statements as of such date or (ii) as set forth in
Section 4.8 to the Bergen Disclosure Schedule and except for such
matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Bergen:   14    (a) Bergen
and its subsidiaries (i) have duly filed all Tax Returns (as defined in
Section 4.8(d)) (including, but not limited to, those filed on
a consolidated, combined or unitary basis) required to have been filed by
Bergen or its subsidiaries, all of which Tax Returns are true and correct;
(ii) have within the time and manner prescribed by Applicable Law paid or,
prior to the Effective Time, will pay all Taxes (as defined in Section
4.8(d)), required to be paid in respect of the periods covered by such Tax
Returns or otherwise due to any Governmental Authority; (iii) have
established or, prior to the Effective Time, will establish, in accordance
with their normal accounting practices and procedures, accruals and reserves
that are adequate for the payment of all Taxes not yet due and payable and
attributable to any period preceding the Effective Time; (iv) are not
delinquent in the payment of any Tax; and (v) have not received written
notice of any deficiencies for any Tax from any Governmental Authority
against Bergen or any of its subsidiaries, which deficiency has not been
satisfied. Neither Bergen nor any of its subsidiaries is the subject of
any currently ongoing Tax audit. With respect to any taxable period ended
prior to September 30, 1996, all federal income Tax Returns including Bergen
or any of its subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service
or are closed by the applicable statute of limitations. There are no liens
with respect to Taxes upon any of the properties or assets, real or personal,
tangible or intangible, of Bergen or any of its subsidiaries (other than
liens for Taxes not yet due). No claim has ever been made in writing by a
Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where Bergen or its subsidiaries do
not file Tax Returns that Bergen or any of its subsidiaries is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither Bergen nor any of its
subsidiaries has filed an election under Section 341(f) of the Code to be
treated as a consenting corporation.   (b) Neither Bergen nor any of its
subsidiaries is obligated by any contract, agreement or other arrangement to
indemnify any other person with respect to Taxes. Neither Bergen nor any of
its subsidiaries is now or has ever been a party to or bound by any contract,
agreement or other arrangement (whether or not written and including, without
limitation, any arrangement required or permitted by Applicable Law
(including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous
provision of state, local or foreign law)) which (i) requires Bergen or any
of its subsidiaries to make any Tax payment to (other than payments made
prior to September 30, 2000) or for the account of any other person, (ii)
affords any other person the benefit of any net operating loss, net capital
loss, investment Tax credit, foreign Tax credit, charitable deduction or any
other credit or Tax attribute which could reduce Taxes (including, without
limitation, deductions and credits related to alternative minimum Taxes) of
Bergen or any of its subsidiaries, or (iii) requires or permits the transfer
or assignment of income, revenues, receipts or gains to Bergen or any of its
subsidiaries from any other person.   (c) Bergen and its subsidiaries have
withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party.   (d) For purposes
of this Agreement, (i) "Tax" (and, with correlative meaning, "Taxes") means
any federal, state, local or foreign income, gross receipts, property, sales,
use, license, excise, franchise, employment, payroll, premium, withholding,
alternative or added minimum, ad valorem, inventory, transfer or excise tax,
or any other tax, custom, duty, governmental fee or other like assessment or
charge of any kind whatsoever, together with any interest or penalty, imposed
by any Governmental Authority, and (ii) "Tax Return" means any    
15   return, report or similar statement required to be filed with respect
to any Tax (including any attached schedules), including, without limitation,
any information return, claim for refund, amended return or declaration of
estimated Tax.   4.9. Compliance with Law. Except (a) as set forth in
Section 4.9 to the Bergen Disclosure Schedule or (b) as specifically
disclosed in the Bergen SEC Documents filed with the Commission prior to the
date hereof, to the knowledge of Bergen, Bergen and its subsidiaries are in
compliance with all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations,
policies or guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders
entered, by any Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, the
Federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act and comparable or related state law
provisions, the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, the Good Manufacturing Practices and other standards of the
Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), federal Medicare and Medicaid
statutes, including, without limitation, 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b and 42
U.S.C. Section 1395nn or related state or local statutes or regulations,
applicable state laws regulating pharmacy or wholesaling practices, statutes
and regulations relating to billing or sales practices, the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act and
the regulations promulgated thereunder (all such laws, statutes, orders,
rules, regulations, policies, guidelines, judgments, decisions and
orders, collectively, "Applicable Laws"), relating to Bergen, its
subsidiaries or their respective business or properties, except where the
failure to be in compliance with such Applicable Laws individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Bergen. Except (a) as disclosed in Section 4.9 to the Bergen Disclosure
Schedule or (b) as specifically disclosed in the Bergen SEC Documents filed
with the Commission prior to the date hereof, no investigation or review by
any Governmental Authority with respect to Bergen or any of its subsidiaries
is pending, or, to the knowledge of Bergen, threatened in writing, nor has
any Governmental Authority indicated in writing an intention to conduct the
same, other than those the outcome of which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Bergen. Since the date of this Agreement, there have been no changes in the
status, as such status was disclosed to AmeriSource and its representatives
prior to the date of this Agreement, of the matters disclosed on Section 4.9
to the Bergen Disclosure Schedule that, in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Bergen or a material adverse
effect on the ability of Bergen to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.   4.10. Intellectual Property. Except as set forth in Section 4.10
to the Bergen Disclosure Schedule and except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Bergen, Bergen and its subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other
valid rights to use all patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights,
trade names, trade dress, trade name rights, copyrights, service marks, trade
secrets, applications for registration of trademarks and for service marks,
computer software and data bases, including all embodiments or fixations
thereof and related documentation, know-how and other proprietary rights and
information ("Intellectual Property") used in or necessary for the conduct of

leased, used, operated and conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing or in good standing or to have such corporate power or
authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource. Each of AmeriSource and
each subsidiary of AmeriSource is duly qualified to do business and in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
by it or the property it owns, leases or operates requires it to so qualify,
except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing in such
jurisdiction individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource. AmeriSource is not
in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any provision of
its Restated Certificate of Incorporation or its Bylaws, each as in effect on
the date hereof (the "AmeriSource Certificate" and the "AmeriSource Bylaws,"
respectively). AmeriSource has heretofore furnished to Bergen a complete and
correct copy of the AmeriSource Certificate and the AmeriSource Bylaws. No
subsidiary of AmeriSource is in default in the performance, observance or
fulfillment of any provision of such subsidiary\'s Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, each as in effect on the date hereof.   5.2.

subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens, pledges, security interests,
claims or other encumbrances. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock
of each of AmeriSource\'s subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued,

Section 5.5 to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule and, in the case of (b),
(c) and (d), for any of the following that would not, individually or in the

AmeriSource or a material adverse effect on the ability of AmeriSource to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the AmeriSource Stock Option Agreement by
AmeriSource, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby will:   (a) conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision
of, the AmeriSource Certificate or the AmeriSource Bylaws,   (b) to the

business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition
of AmeriSource or any of its subsidiaries which individually or in
the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on AmeriSource, or any event, occurrence or development which individually or
in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on the ability of
AmeriSource to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   5.7.
AmeriSource SEC Documents. Except as set forth in Section 5.7 to
the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule, AmeriSource has timely filed with
the Commission all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed by them since December 31, 1997 under the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act (such documents, as supplemented and
amended since the time of filing, collectively, the "AmeriSource SEC
Documents"). The AmeriSource SEC Documents, including, without limitation,
any financial statements or schedules included therein, at the time filed
(and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the
dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively) (a) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and (b) except as set forth in Section 5.7 to the AmeriSource
Disclosure Schedule, complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be.
The financial statements of AmeriSource included in the AmeriSource
SEC Documents at the time filed (and,      29   in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of mailing, respectively) complied as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the Commission with respect thereto, were prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the Commission), and fairly present (subject, in the case of the
unaudited financial statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments), in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AmeriSource and
its consolidated subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended. No
subsidiary of AmeriSource is subject to the periodic reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act or required to file any form, report or other document
with the Commission, the NYSE, any other stock exchange or any other
comparable Governmental Authority.   5.8. Taxes. Except as reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet of AmeriSource as of September 30, 2000, included
in the AmeriSource SEC Documents, or disclosed in the footnotes to the
financial statements as of such date or (ii) as set forth in Section 5.8 to
the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule and except for such matters that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource:   (a) AmeriSource and its
subsidiaries (i) have duly filed all Tax Returns (including, but not limited
to, those filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis) required to
have been filed by AmeriSource or its subsidiaries, all of which Tax Returns
are true and correct; (ii) have within the time and manner prescribed by
Applicable Law paid or, prior to the Effective Time, will pay all Taxes,
required to be paid in respect of the periods covered by such Tax Returns or
otherwise due to any Governmental Authority; (iii) have established or, prior
to the Effective Time, will establish, in accordance with their normal
accounting practices and procedures, accruals and reserves that are adequate
for the payment of all Taxes not yet due and payable and attributable to any
period preceding the Effective Time; (iv) are not delinquent in the payment
of any Tax; and (v) have not received written notice of any deficiencies for
any Tax from any Governmental Authority against AmeriSource or any of
its subsidiaries, which deficiency has not been satisfied. Neither
AmeriSource nor any of its subsidiaries is the subject of any currently
ongoing Tax audit. With respect to any taxable period ended prior to
September 30, 1996, all federal income Tax Returns including AmeriSource or
any of its subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service or
are closed by the applicable statute of limitations. There are no liens with
respect to Taxes upon any of the properties or assets, real or personal,
tangible or intangible, of AmeriSource or any of its subsidiaries (other than
liens for Taxes not yet due). No claim has ever been made in writing by a
Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where AmeriSource or its
subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that AmeriSource or any of its
subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither
AmeriSource nor any of its subsidiaries has filed an election under Section
341(f) of the Code to be treated as a consenting corporation.   (b) Neither
AmeriSource nor any of its subsidiaries is obligated by any contract,
agreement or other arrangement to indemnify any other person with respect to
Taxes. Neither AmeriSource nor any of its subsidiaries is now or has ever
been a party to or bound by any contract, agreement or other
arrangement (whether or not written and including, without  
30   limitation, any arrangement required or permitted by Applicable Law
(including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous
provision of state, local or foreign law)) which (i) requires AmeriSource or
any of its subsidiaries to make any Tax payment to (other than payments made
prior to September 30, 2000) or for the account of any other person, (ii)
affords any other person the benefit of any net operating loss, net capital
loss, investment Tax credit, foreign Tax credit, charitable deduction or any
other credit or Tax attribute which could reduce Taxes (including, without
limitation, deductions and credits related to alternative minimum Taxes) of
AmeriSource or any of its subsidiaries, or (iii) requires or permits the
transfer or assignment of income, revenues, receipts or gains to AmeriSource
or any of its subsidiaries from any other person.   (c) AmeriSource and its
subsidiaries have withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld
and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party.   5.9.

the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule or (b) as specifically disclosed in
the AmeriSource SEC Documents filed with the Commission prior to the date
hereof, to the knowledge of AmeriSource, AmeriSource and its subsidiaries are
in compliance with all Applicable Laws relating to AmeriSource, its
subsidiaries or their respective business or properties, except where the
failure to be in compliance with such Applicable Laws individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on AmeriSource. Except (a) as disclosed in Section 5.9 to the
AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule or (b) as specifically disclosed in the
AmeriSource SEC Documents filed with the Commission prior to the date hereof,
no investigation or review by any Governmental Authority with respect to
AmeriSource or any of its subsidiaries is pending, or, to the knowledge of
AmeriSource, threatened in writing, nor has any Governmental Authority
indicated in writing an intention to conduct the same, other than those the
outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource. Since the date of
this Agreement, there have been no changes in the status, as such status was
disclosed to Bergen and its representatives prior to the date of this
Agreement, of the matters disclosed on Section 5.9 to the AmeriSource
Disclosure Schedule that, in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource or a material adverse effect on
the ability of AmeriSource to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.   5.10. Intellectual Property. Except as set forth in
Section 5.10 to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule and except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on AmeriSource, AmeriSource and its subsidiaries own or
possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all Intellectual
Property used in or necessary for the conduct of the business of AmeriSource
and its subsidiaries as currently conducted. Except as set forth in Section
5.10 to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule, the conduct of the businesses of
AmeriSource and its subsidiaries as currently conducted does not, to the
knowledge of AmeriSource, conflict with or infringe upon any Intellectual
Property of any third party except for any conflict or infringement that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource. Except as set forth in Section 5.10
to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule and except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on      31   AmeriSource, to AmeriSource\'s knowledge, no third party
is infringing on any of the Intellectual Property owned by AmeriSource or any
of its subsidiaries.   5.11. Title to Properties. AmeriSource and its
subsidiaries own or hold under valid leases all real property, plants,
machinery and equipment necessary for the conduct of the business of
AmeriSource and its subsidiaries as presently conducted, except where the
failure to own or so hold such property, plants, machinery and equipment
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource.   5.12. Registration Statement;
Joint Proxy Statement. None of the information provided by AmeriSource in
writing for inclusion in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or the Joint
Proxy Statement, at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective or,
in the case of the Joint Proxy Statement, at the date of mailing and at the
date of the Bergen Shareholders Meeting or the AmeriSource Shareholders
Meeting, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement, except for such portion
thereof that relates only to Bergen and its subsidiaries (as to which no
representations or warranties are made), will comply as to form in
all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act.   5.13.
Litigation. Except (a) as set forth in Section 5.13 to the AmeriSource
Disclosure Schedule or (b) specifically disclosed in the AmeriSource SEC
Documents filed with the Commission prior to the date of this
Agreement, there is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of AmeriSource,
threatened against AmeriSource or any of its subsidiaries which, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on AmeriSource or a material adverse effect on the ability of
AmeriSource to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as set
forth in Section 5.13 to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule, neither
AmeriSource nor any of its subsidiaries is currently subject to any
outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree specifically applicable to
AmeriSource or any of its subsidiaries which, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
AmeriSource or a material adverse effect on the ability of AmeriSource to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Since the date of this
Agreement, there have been no changes in the status, as such status was
disclosed to Bergen and its representatives prior to the date of
this Agreement, of the Actions pending against AmeriSource or any of its
subsidiaries and set forth in Section 5.13 to the AmeriSource Disclosure
Schedule that, in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource or a material adverse effect on the
ability of AmeriSource to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.   5.14. Brokerage and Finder\'s Fees; Expenses. Except in connection
with the retention of Goldman, Sachs and Co. ("Goldman Sachs") (the fees of
which firm shall be the sole responsibility of AmeriSource), neither
AmeriSource nor any stockholder, director, officer or employee thereof has
incurred or will incur on behalf of AmeriSource any brokerage, finder\'s or
similar fee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. AmeriSource has heretofore furnished to Bergen a complete and
correct copy of the engagement letter between AmeriSource and Goldman
Sachs.      32    5.15. Reorganization. Neither AmeriSource nor any of
its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would cause
Bergen, AmeriSource, the Bergen shareholders or the AmeriSource shareholders
to recognize any gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of
the Reorganization (except to the extent that cash is received in lieu of
Fractional Shares and to the extent of payments made pursuant to Section
6.1(i)).   5.16. Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) With respect to each
AmeriSource Plan, AmeriSource has provided to Bergen a true, correct and
complete copy of each material document relating to a material liability with

has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each AmeriSource
Qualified Plan and, to the knowledge of AmeriSource, there are no existing
circumstances nor any events that have occurred that could adversely affect
the qualified status of any AmeriSource Qualified Plan or the related
trust.   (c) All contributions required to be made to any AmeriSource Plan
by Applicable Laws or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking,
and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding
any AmeriSource Plan, before the date hereof have been made or paid in full
on or before the final due date thereof and through the Effective Time will
be made or paid in full on or before the final due date thereof.   (d)
AmeriSource and its subsidiaries have complied, and are now in compliance,
with all applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and all Applicable Laws
relating to employees and employee benefits, except for such non- compliance
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource. Each AmeriSource Plan has been
established and operated in compliance with its terms and Applicable Laws,
except for such non-compliance which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource.
There is not now, and there are no existing circumstances that individually
or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to give rise to, any
requirement for the posting of security with respect to an AmeriSource
Plan or the imposition of any lien on the assets of AmeriSource or any of
its subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. AmeriSource and its subsidiaries
are each in compliance with all Applicable Laws respecting employment, except
for such non-compliance which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource.  
(e) Except as set forth in Section 5.16(e) to the AmeriSource Disclosure
Schedule, no AmeriSource Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer
Plan, nor has AmeriSource or any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates, at any time    33   within six years
before the date hereof, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. With respect to each
Multiemployer Plan: (i) neither AmeriSource nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied
in full; (ii) neither AmeriSource nor any ERISA Affiliate has received any
notification, nor has any reason to believe, that any such plan is in
reorganization, is insolvent, or has been terminated, or could reasonably be
expected to be in reorganization, to be insolvent, or to be terminated; and
(iii) no circumstances exist which individually or in the aggregate could
reasonably be expected to result in Withdrawal Liability with respect to an
AmeriSource Plan.   (f) There does not now exist, and there are no existing
circumstances that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be
expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that individually or in
the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on AmeriSource or any of its subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, neither AmeriSource nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in
Section 4069 of ERISA.   (g) Except for health continuation coverage as
required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and

liability for life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to former
employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof.   (h) Except as disclosed
in Section 5.16(h) to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will result in, cause the accelerated
vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or
benefit to any employee, officer, director or consultant of AmeriSource or
any of its subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
except as set forth in Section 5.16(h) to the AmeriSource
Disclosure Schedule, no amount paid or payable by AmeriSource or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions
in conjunction with any other events will be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.   (i) Except as disclosed
in Section 5.16(i) to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule, there are no
pending, or to the knowledge of AmeriSource threatened, Actions (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course) with respect to the AmeriSource
Plans which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource or any of its
subsidiaries.   (j) Section 5.16(j) to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule

subsidiaries, (m) stock purchase agreements, asset purchase agreements or
other acquisition or divestiture agreements relating to material transactions
since January 1, 1998, or (n) any agreement the absence of which would
reasonably be expected to have a   35   Material Adverse Effect on
AmeriSource. All Contracts required to be disclosed in Section 5.17 to the
AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule and all Contracts filed as an exhibit to any
AmeriSource SEC Document and all AmeriSource Plans to which AmeriSource or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound are valid and
binding obligations of AmeriSource or such subsidiary and, to the knowledge
of AmeriSource, the valid and binding obligation of each other party thereto
except such Contracts which if not so valid and binding would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource. Neither AmeriSource or any of its
subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of AmeriSource, any other party thereto is
in violation of or in default in respect of, nor has there occurred an event
or condition which with the passage of time or giving of notice (or both)
would constitute a default under or permit the termination of, any such
Contract except such violations or defaults under or terminations which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource. Set forth in Section 5.17(o) to the
AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule is a description of any material changes to
the amount and terms of the indebtedness of AmeriSource and its subsidiaries
from the description in the financial statements (including the notes

is a party other than any Contracts heretofore filed as an exhibit to any
AmeriSource SEC Document and any Contracts that are cancelable on less than
91 days notice without penalty.   5.18. Labor Matters. Except as set forth
in Section 5.18 to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule, neither AmeriSource

agreements with any persons employed by AmeriSource or any of its
subsidiaries or any persons otherwise performing services primarily for

AmeriSource or any of its subsidiaries in the process of negotiating any such
agreement. There is no labor strike, dispute or stoppage pending or, to the
knowledge of AmeriSource, threatened against AmeriSource or any of its
subsidiaries which individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and neither AmeriSource nor
any of its subsidiaries has experienced any such labor strike, dispute or
stoppage since September 30, 1997.   5.19. Undisclosed Liabilities. Except

Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource. Since the date of this Agreement,
there have been no changes in the status, as such status was disclosed to
Bergen and its representatives prior to the date of this Agreement, of the

Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource or a material adverse effect on the
ability of AmeriSource to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.   5.20. Operation of AmeriSource\'s Business; Relationships.   (a)

36   AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule or as specifically disclosed in the

operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted (collectively, the "AmeriSource Permits"), except where the
failure to be in possession of such AmeriSource Permits would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on AmeriSource or a material adverse effect on the ability of
AmeriSource to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and there is
no Action pending or, to the knowledge of AmeriSource, threatened in writing
regarding any of the AmeriSource Permits which, if successful, would have a
Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource. Neither AmeriSource nor any of its

AmeriSource Permits, except for any such conflicts, defaults or violations
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource.   (b) Except as set forth in

law of any jurisdiction; and   (iv) to the knowledge of AmeriSource, none of
AmeriSource, its subsidiaries or any of their officers, employees or agents

by AmeriSource pursuant to the AmeriSource Certificate, the AmeriSource
Bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date
hereof with any directors, officers and employees of AmeriSource and its
subsidiaries and (y) without limitation to clause (x), to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, in each case for act or omissions occurring at

connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby), (B) include and cause to be maintained in
effect in the Parent (or any successor\'s) Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws after the Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of

to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in
the AmeriSource Certificate and AmeriSource Bylaws, (C) periodically advance
to any such indemnitee its legal and other expenses (including the cost of
any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject
to clause (iii) of this Section 6.1(f), and subject to the providing by such
indemnitee of an undertaking to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the
event of a final non-appealable determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such indemnitee is not entitled hereto and (D) cause to be
maintained for a period of six years after the Effective Time the current
policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by AmeriSource (provided that Parent (or any
successor) may substitute therefor one or more policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be required to expend in any
one year an amount in excess of $1,500,000 for such insurance; and,
provided further that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.  
43    (ii) Parent shall (A) indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors, officers and employees of Bergen and its subsidiaries
(in all of their capacities) (x) to the same extent such persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of
this Agreement by Bergen pursuant to the Bergen Certificate, the Bergen
Bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date
hereof with any directors, officers and employees of Bergen and its
subsidiaries and (y) without limitation to clause (x), to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, in each case for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby), (B) include and cause to be maintained in
effect in the Parent (or any successor\'s) Certificate and Bylaws after the
Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,

expenses which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the
Bergen Certificate and the Bergen Bylaws, (C) periodically advance to any
such indemnitee its legal and other expenses (including the cost of any
investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject to
the following clause (iii), and subject to the providing by such indemnitee
of an undertaking to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the event of a
final non-appealable determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that
such indemnitee is not entitled hereto and (D) cause to be maintained for a
period of six years after the Effective Time the current policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by Bergen (provided that Parent (or any successor) may
substitute therefor one or more policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that
in no event shall Parent be required to expend in any one year an amount in
excess of $1,500,000 for such insurance; and, provided further that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall
be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.   (iii) The indemnitee under this Section
6.1(f) shall control the defense of any claim with counsel selected by such
indemnitee, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, provided
that Parent shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such claim at
its own expense. Parent shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses
of more than one counsel for all indemnitees in any single claim except to
the extent that, in the opinion of independent legal counsel selected by the
indemnitee, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent,
representation of two or more of such indemnitees would present a conflict of
interest under applicable standards of conduct in the legal profession.
Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written
consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.   (iv) The
obligations of Parent under this Section 6.1(f) shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
Section 6.1(f) applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section
6.1(f) applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.1(f)). In
the event that Parent or any of its successors or assigns (A) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (B)
transfers all or substantially all its properties and assets to    
44   any person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the indemnification
obligations set forth in this Section 6.1(f).   (g) NYSE Listing. Each of
AmeriSource, Bergen and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Mergers to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Effective Time.   (h) Employees and Employee Benefits.
AmeriSource and Bergen will work together to design benefit plans to be
adopted by Parent for the benefit of its employees as soon as practicable
following the Mergers. Until such adoption, Parent shall cause all
AmeriSource Plans and all Bergen Plans to be maintained in full force and
effect. The benefit plans adopted by Parent shall provide past service credit
for employees of AmeriSource and of Bergen, for the same purposes and to the
same extent, as such service was credited under the corresponding plans
maintained by AmeriSource or Bergen, as the case may be, immediately prior to
the adoption of the Parent plans. In addition, the Parent plans that
are welfare benefit plans, as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, will waive
any pre-existing condition limitations other than those to which any such
employee is subject under the terms of the applicable AmeriSource or Bergen
plan, credit any complete or partial satisfaction of any deductibles or out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by any AmeriSource or Bergen employee or the
dependent or beneficiary thereof and will credit any credit balances or other
entitlements under any cafeteria plan maintained by AmeriSource or
Bergen.   (i) Conveyance Taxes. Parent shall be liable for and shall
hold holders of AmeriSource Common Stock or Bergen Common Stock who are
holders of the AmeriSource Common Stock or Bergen Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time harmless against any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording registration, and other fees, and any similar Taxes which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties acknowledge that this Section 6.1(i) is specifically
intended to benefit the holders of AmeriSource Common Stock or Bergen Common
Stock who are holders of the AmeriSource Common Stock or Bergen Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (j) Parent Rights Agreement. At
or prior to the Effective Time, each of AmeriSource and Bergen shall cause
Parent to duly adopt a Shareholder Rights Agreement (the "Parent Rights
Agreement"), in form and substance mutually agreeable to AmeriSource and
Bergen.   (k) Dividends. It is the intention of the parties hereto that
Parent declare and pay quarterly dividends per share of Parent Common Stock
of $0.025 per share, subject to approval and declaration thereof by the Board
of Directors of Parent.   (l) No Activities. AmeriSource and Bergen shall
each take such actions as are necessary to ensure that none of Parent,
AmeriSource Merger Sub or Bergen Merger Sub incurs, directly or indirectly,
through any subsidiary or affiliate, any obligations or liabilities or
engages in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or enters
into any agreements      45   or arrangements with any person, other
than obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its respective
incorporation or organization and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   6.2. Covenants of AmeriSource.   (a) AmeriSource Shareholders
Meeting. AmeriSource shall take all action in accordance with the federal
securities laws, the DGCL and the AmeriSource Certificate and AmeriSource
Bylaws necessary to convene a special meeting of the holders of shares of
AmeriSource Class A Common Stock entitled to vote (the "AmeriSource
Shareholders Meeting") to be held and completed on the earliest practicable
date determined by the parties (which date shall be the same date as the date
of the Bergen Shareholders Meeting or as close to one another as reasonably
practicable), to consider and vote upon approval and adoption of the Mergers,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however,
that AmeriSource shall not hold the AmeriSource Shareholders Meeting until
any applicable waiting periods (and any extensions thereof, including any
written commitment to an HSR Authority to defer or delay consummation of the
Mergers notwithstanding expiration of such waiting periods) under the HSR Act
relating to the Mergers and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall have expired or been terminated.   (b) Joint Proxy Statement;
Registration Statement. The Joint Proxy Statement shall include the
AmeriSource Board Recommendations to the extent not previously withdrawn in
compliance with Section 6.2(d) and the opinion of Goldman Sachs referred to
in Section 5.23, unless previously withdrawn or revoked or modified in any
material respect. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, AmeriSource
shall obtain knowledge of any information pertaining to AmeriSource that
would require an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the
Joint Proxy Statement, AmeriSource shall so advise Bergen and Parent in
writing and shall promptly furnish Bergen and Parent with all information as
shall be required for such amendment or supplement and shall promptly take
such action as shall be required to amend or supplement the Registration
Statement and/or the Joint Proxy Statement. Consistent with the timing for
the AmeriSource Shareholders Meeting and the Bergen Shareholders Meeting,
AmeriSource shall use its reasonable best efforts to mail at the earliest
practicable date to the holders of shares of AmeriSource Class A Common Stock
the Joint Proxy Statement, which shall include all information required
by Applicable Law to be furnished to the shareholders of AmeriSource in
connection with the Mergers and the transactions contemplated thereby.  
(c) Conduct of AmeriSource\'s Operations. During the period from the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, AmeriSource shall conduct
its operations in the ordinary course except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain and preserve its business organization
and to retain the services of its officers and key employees and maintain
relationships with customers, suppliers, lessees, licensees and other third
parties to the end that its goodwill and ongoing business shall not be
impaired in any material respect. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, AmeriSource shall not, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or as set forth in
Section 6.2(c) to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule, without the prior
written consent of Bergen (which shall not be unreasonably withheld):    
46    (i) do or effect any of the following actions with respect to
its securities (provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.2(c)(i)
shall prevent AmeriSource from distributing AmeriSource Rights to the holders
of AmeriSource Common Stock or from issuing shares of AmeriSource Class A
Common Stock upon conversion of AmeriSource Convertible Notes): (A) adjust,
split, combine or reclassify its capital stock, (B) make, declare or pay any
dividend or distribution on, or directly or indirectly redeem, purchase or
otherwise acquire, any shares of its capital stock or any securities or
obligations convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of its capital
stock, (C) grant any person any right or option to acquire any shares of its
capital stock (provided that AmeriSource may grant AmeriSource Options to
purchase shares of AmeriSource Common Stock if such grants are made at such
times and in such amounts as are consistent with previous grants by
AmeriSource in the ordinary course of business ("Additional AmeriSource
Options") and if the Additional AmeriSource Options provide that the
consummation of the Mergers shall not be an event which accelerates the
vesting thereof), (D) issue, deliver or sell or agree to issue, deliver or
sell any additional shares of its capital stock or any other securities or
obligations convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of
its capital stock or such securities (except pursuant to the exercise of
AmeriSource Options which are outstanding as of the date hereof or which are
granted by AmeriSource prior to the Effective Time in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement) or (E) enter into any agreement, understanding or
arrangement with respect to the sale, voting, registration or repurchase of
its capital stock;   (ii) directly or indirectly sell, transfer, lease,
pledge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of its material
property or assets other than inventory in the ordinary course of
business;    (iii) amend the AmeriSource Certificate or the AmeriSource
Bylaws;   (iv) merge or consolidate with any other person;   (v) acquire
assets (other than inventory in the ordinary course of business) or capital
stock of or other equity interests in any other person or persons valued,
giving effect to assumed indebtedness, at more than $100 million in the
aggregate; provided that AmeriSource shall give Bergen written notice of any
acquisition of assets or capital stock of or other equity interests in
any other person, regardless of the size of the transaction, at least six
business days prior to the filing of any application under the HSR Act with
respect thereto or, if no such filing is made, at least six business days
prior to the entering into of any agreement to make such an acquisition,
provided the agreement is contingent on compliance with this paragraph (v),
and provided, further, that AmeriSource shall not make any acquisition of (A)
any entity engaged in the U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business (as
defined below) or (B) any other business, regardless of the size of the
transaction, if (x) in the case of clause (A), either AmeriSource\'s outside
antitrust counsel or Bergen\'s outside antitrust counsel shall, within five
business days of receipt of the aforesaid notice, deliver to AmeriSource its
written opinion that such acquisition would materially and adversely affect
the ability of Section 7.1(b), 7.1(c) and 7.1(d) (insofar as they relate to
federal Antitrust Laws) to be satisfied or would result in any material delay
in the timing of the satisfaction of such Sections (AmeriSource agreeing
promptly to provide Bergen\'s counsel with all information, analyses and
materials available to AmeriSource in connection with such acquisition that
would be reasonably necessary in    47   formulating its opinion); and
(y) in the case of clause (B), if such acquisition would materially and
adversely affect the ability of Section 7.1(b), 7.1(c) and 7.1(d) (insofar as
they relate to federal Antitrust Laws) to be satisfied or would result in any
material delay in the timing of the satisfaction of such Sections; (for the
purposes of this Section 6.2(c)(v) only, an entity shall be deemed to be
engaged in the U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business if it derived at
least $100 million in revenues from the pharmaceutical distribution business
(and shall have more than $25 million of revenues in the U.S. or $15 million
in assets in the U.S.) in its fiscal year preceding the date of the agreement
or filing referred to above (it being understood that, with respect to joint
ventures or newly formed entities, the revenues of such entity for a fiscal
year will include revenues the contributing party derived from the assets or
businesses contributed to such entity for the entire twelve-month
period ending on the same date as the end of such entity\'s fiscal
year));   (vi) except (A) pursuant to existing credit arrangements set
forth in Section 5.17 to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule, (B) in
connection with extensions, renewals, refinancings, refundings and
replacements of the bank financings set forth in Section 5.17 to the
AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule that (1) do not involve the issuance of any
shares of capital stock of AmeriSource or any of its subsidiaries or any
other securities or obligations convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any shares of capital stock and (2) either (x) do not provide
for a prepayment penalty or (y) do not include restrictions on a change in
control of AmeriSource that would be implicated by the Mergers, or (C) in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, incur, create,
assume or otherwise become liable for any indebtedness for borrowed money or
assume, guarantee, endorse or otherwise as an accommodation
become responsible or liable for the obligations of any other individual,
corporation or other entity;   (vii) enter into or modify any employment,
severance, stay-put, termination or similar agreements or arrangements with,
or grant any bonuses, salary increases, severance or termination pay to, any
officer, director, consultant or employee other than in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice (except for change-of-control
severance agreements that in all cases shall require the prior written
consent of Bergen), or otherwise increase the compensation or benefits
provided to any officer, director, consultant or employee except as may be
required by Applicable Law or in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice;   (viii) enter into, adopt or amend any employee benefit
or similar plan except as may be required by Applicable Law;   (ix) change
any method or principle of accounting in a manner that is inconsistent with
past practice except to the extent required by generally accepted accounting
principles as advised by AmeriSource\'s regular independent public
accountants, or make any material Tax election (unless required by law
or consistent with prior practice) or, unless Bergen is given reasonable
prior written notice thereof, settle any material Tax liability which is the
subject of dispute between AmeriSource and a Governmental Authority;   (x)
modify, amend or terminate, or waive, release or assign any material rights
or claims with respect to, any Contract ("Contract Actions") other than
Contract     48   Actions in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on AmeriSource;  
(xi) enter into any standstill or non-compete agreements or arrangements
which after the Effective Time would apply or purport to apply to Parent or
any of its subsidiaries;   (xii) incur or commit to any capital
expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, in excess of the amount set
forth in Section 6.2(c)(xii) to the AmeriSource Disclosure Schedule;  
(xiii) except as permitted by Section 6.2(d), take any action to exempt or
make not subject to (x) the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL or (y) any
other state takeover law or state law that purports to limit or
restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares, any
person or entity (other than Parent, Bergen or their subsidiaries) or any
action taken thereby, which person, entity or action would have otherwise
been subject to the restrictive provisions thereof and not exempt
therefrom;   (xiv) modify or waive any of its rights under any provision of
any confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement;   (xv) take any
action that will likely result in the representations and warranties set
forth in Article V becoming false or inaccurate in any material respect;  
(xvi) enter into or carry out any other transaction other than in the
ordinary and usual course of business or other than as permitted pursuant
to the other clauses in this Section 6.2(c);   (xvii) permit or cause any
subsidiary to do any of the foregoing or agree or commit to do any of the
foregoing; or   (xviii) agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the
foregoing actions.   (d) No Solicitation. During the term of this
Agreement, AmeriSource shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of
its subsidiaries or any of its or its subsidiaries\' directors, officers,
employees, agents or representatives, directly or indirectly, to solicit,
initiate, encourage or facilitate, or furnish or disclose any information in
furtherance of, any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to
any recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other business combination
involving AmeriSource, or acquisition of any capital stock from AmeriSource
(other than (i) upon exercise of AmeriSource options which are outstanding as
of the date hereof or which have been granted by AmeriSource prior to the
Effective Time in compliance with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) upon
the conversion of the AmeriSource Convertible Notes) or 15% or more of the
assets of AmeriSource and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, or any acquisition by
AmeriSource of any material assets or capital stock of any other person
(other than to the extent specifically permitted by Section 6.2(c)(v)), or
any combination of the foregoing (an "AmeriSource Competing Transaction"), or
negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with    49   any person
(other than Bergen or its respective directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives) with respect to any AmeriSource Competing Transaction or
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Mergers or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that, at any time
prior to the approval of the Mergers by the holders of shares of AmeriSource
Class A Common Stock, AmeriSource may furnish information to, and negotiate
or otherwise engage in discussions with, any party who delivers a written
proposal for an AmeriSource Competing Transaction which was not solicited or
encouraged after the date of this Agreement if and so long as (i) the Board
of Directors of AmeriSource determines in good faith by a majority vote,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to take such
action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of AmeriSource under Applicable Law and determines, after
consulting with Goldman Sachs (or any other nationally recognized investment
banking firm), that such proposal is more favorable to AmeriSource\'s
shareholders from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and
conditions proposed by Bergen in response to such AmeriSource Competing
Transaction) and reasonably likely to be consummated after taking
into consideration all the terms and conditions of such proposal (including
the availability of financing, the conditions to consummation and the
likelihood of objections under applicable Antitrust Laws) and (ii) prior to
furnishing such information to, or entering into negotiations or discussions
with such party, AmeriSource uses its reasonable best efforts to obtain from
such party an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable
to AmeriSource than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as
defined in Section 6.2(f)). AmeriSource will immediately cease all existing
activities, discussions and negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any proposal for an AmeriSource Competing
Transaction. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.2(d), in
the event that prior to the approval of the Mergers by the holders of shares
of AmeriSource Class A Common Stock the Board of Directors of AmeriSource
determines in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to do so would constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the AmeriSource Board of Directors under Applicable Law,
the Board of Directors of AmeriSource may (subject to this and the following
sentences) withdraw, modify or change, in a manner adverse to Bergen, the
AmeriSource Board Recommendation and take and disclose to the shareholders of
AmeriSource a position with respect to the AmeriSource Competing Transaction
and, to the extent applicable, comply with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with respect to an AmeriSource Competing Transaction
by disclosing such withdrawn, modified or changed AmeriSource Board
Recommendation and recommendation with respect to the AmeriSource Competing
Transaction in connection with a tender or exchange offer for AmeriSource
securities, provided that it uses its reasonable best efforts to give Bergen
two days prior written notice of its intention to do so. The AmeriSource
Board of Directors shall not, in connection with any such withdrawal,
modification or change of the AmeriSource Board Recommendation, take any
action to change the approval of the Board of Directors of AmeriSource for
purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state law or the
AmeriSource Rights Agreement to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including this Agreement, the AmeriSource Stock Option
Agreement, the AmeriSource Support Agreements and the Mergers, provided,
however, that this sentence shall not prohibit AmeriSource from withdrawing,
modifying or changing its recommendation or approving or recommending any
AmeriSource Competing Transaction under the circumstances    50   and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 6.2(d).
Notwithstanding any subsequent determination by the Board of Directors of
AmeriSource to change the AmeriSource Board Recommendation, this Agreement
shall be submitted to the holders of shares of AmeriSource Class A Common
Stock at the AmeriSource Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve AmeriSource of
such obligation. From and after the execution of this Agreement, AmeriSource
shall immediately advise Bergen in writing of the receipt, directly or
indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations, or proposals
relating to an AmeriSource Competing Transaction (including the specific
terms thereof and the identity of the other party or parties involved) and
furnish to Bergen as promptly as practicable, and in any event within two
days of such receipt, an accurate description of all material terms
(including any changes or adjustments to such terms as a result
of negotiations or otherwise) of any such written proposal in addition to
any information provided to any third party relating thereto.   (e)
Affiliates of AmeriSource. AmeriSource shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause each person who may be at the Effective Time or was on the date
hereof an "affiliate" of AmeriSource for purposes of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act to execute and deliver to Parent no less than 30 days
prior to the date of the AmeriSource Shareholders Meeting, the written
undertakings in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "AmeriSource
Affiliate Letter"). No later than 45 days prior to the date of the
AmeriSource Shareholders Meeting, AmeriSource, after consultation with its
outside counsel, shall provide Parent with a letter (reasonably satisfactory
to outside counsel to Parent) specifying all of the persons or entities who,
in AmeriSource\'s opinion, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of AmeriSource
under the preceding sentence. AmeriSource shall provide Parent with such
information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of
reviewing such letter. The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent shall be
entitled to place legends as specified in the AmeriSource Affiliate Letter on
the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
received by (i) any such "affiliate" of AmeriSource specified in such letter
or (ii) any person Parent reasonably identifies (by written notice to
AmeriSource) as being a person who may be deemed an "affiliate" for purposes
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the
transfer agent for the shares of Parent Common Stock, consistent with the
terms of the AmeriSource Affiliate Letter, regardless of whether such person
has executed the AmeriSource Affiliate Letter and regardless of whether such
person\'s name appears on the letter to be delivered pursuant to the
preceding sentence. Promptly upon the request of the holder of such
certificates, Parent will issue new certificates with no legends, and will
countermand the stop transfer instructions, consistent with the terms of the
AmeriSource Affiliate Letter.   (f) Access. AmeriSource shall permit
representatives of Bergen to have appropriate access at all reasonable times
to AmeriSource\'s premises, properties, books, records, contracts and
documents and shall cause its independent public accountants to give Bergen
access to such accountant\'s work papers; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not require AmeriSource to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of AmeriSource
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties, the
loss of any applicable attorney- client privilege or violate any of their
obligations with respect to confidentiality so long as such party shall have
used reasonable efforts to obtain approval to such   51   inspection or
disclosure of such information. Information obtained by Bergen pursuant to
this Section 6.2(f) shall be subject to the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement dated July 19, 2000 between AmeriSource and Bergen (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), which agreement remains in full force
and effect. No investigation conducted pursuant to this Section 6.2(f) or
otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AmeriSource shall have
no obligation to provide Bergen with information if AmeriSource determines in
good faith, upon written advice of its outside antitrust counsel, that
providing such information may violate any Applicable Law.   (g)
Notification of Certain Matters. AmeriSource shall give prompt notice to
Bergen of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or
non-occurrence of which would likely cause any AmeriSource representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior
to the Effective Time in any material respect and (ii) any material failure
of AmeriSource to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.2(g) shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Bergen.   (h)
Subsequent Financial Statements. AmeriSource shall consult with Bergen prior
to making publicly available its financial results for any period after the
date of this Agreement and prior to filing any AmeriSource SEC Documents
after the date of this Agreement, it being understood that Bergen shall have
no liability by reason of such consultation.   (i) Letters of Accountants.
AmeriSource shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
Parent and Bergen "comfort" letters of Ernst and Young LLP, AmeriSource\'s
independent public accountants, dated a date within two business days before
the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective, the date
the Joint Proxy Statement is mailed and the date of the Bergen Shareholders
Meeting and addressed to Parent and Bergen, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Bergen and reasonably customary in scope and substance for
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.   (j)
Purchases of Common Stock of Bergen. During the period from the date hereof
through the Effective Time, neither AmeriSource nor any of its subsidiaries
will purchase any shares of Bergen Common Stock other than pursuant to the
Bergen Stock Option Agreement.   (k) AmeriSource Options. The AmeriSource
Board of Directors shall, on or prior to the Effective Time, take all actions
necessary to provide that:   (i) all AmeriSource Options granted prior to
February 15, 2001 shall vest as of the close of business on the last business
day prior to the Effective Time;   (ii) the exercise period of such
AmeriSource Options shall be amended to provide that such AmeriSource Options
shall not become exercisable until one year from the Effective Time;
provided, that the foregoing restriction on the exercise of AmeriSource
Options   52   shall not apply to any AmeriSource Options which were
already vested at the Effective Time or would otherwise become vested during
such restricted period under the terms of the relevant AmeriSource option
plan absent clause (i) above;   (iii) in the case of termination of the
option holder for cause, the exercise period of such AmeriSource Options
shall be as currently set forth in the relevant AmeriSource option plan;
and   (iv) in all cases other than termination of the option holder
for cause, the exercise period of such AmeriSource Options shall extend until
the later of (i) 13 months from the Effective Time (subject to extension
pursuant to the insider trading policy of Parent if such policy restricts
transactions in the securities of Parent) or (ii) the end of the exercise
period of such AmeriSource Options as currently set forth in the relevant
AmeriSource option plan.   6.3. Covenants of Bergen.   (a) Bergen
Shareholders Meeting. Bergen shall take all action in accordance with the
federal securities laws, the NJBCA and the Bergen Certificate and the Bergen
Bylaws necessary to convene a special meeting of the holders of shares of
Bergen Common Stock entitled to vote (the "Bergen Shareholders Meeting") to
be held and completed on the earliest practicable date determined by the
parties (which date shall be the same date as the date of the AmeriSource
Shareholders Meeting or as close to one another as reasonably practicable),
to consider and vote upon approval and adoption of the Mergers, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however,
that Bergen shall not hold the Bergen Shareholders Meeting until any
applicable waiting periods (and any extensions thereof, including any written
commitment to an HSR Authority to defer or delay consummation of the Mergers
notwithstanding expiration of such waiting periods) under the HSR Act
relating to the Mergers and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall have expired or been terminated.   (b) Joint Proxy Statement;
Registration Statement. The Joint Proxy Statement shall include the Bergen
Board Recommendations to the extent not previously withdrawn in compliance
with Section 6.3(d) and the opinion of Merrill Lynch referred to in Section
4.23, unless previously withdrawn or revoked or modified in any material
respect. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, Bergen shall obtain
knowledge of any information pertaining to AmeriSource that would require an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement, Bergen shall so advise AmeriSource and Parent in writing and shall
promptly furnish AmeriSource and Parent with all information as shall be
required for such amendment or supplement and shall promptly take such action
as shall be required to amend or supplement the Registration Statement and/or
the Joint Proxy Statement. Consistent with the timing for the AmeriSource
Shareholders Meeting and the Bergen Shareholders Meeting, Bergen shall use
its reasonable best efforts to mail at the earliest practicable date to the
holders of shares of Bergen Common Stock the Joint Proxy Statement, which
shall include all information required by Applicable Law to be furnished to
the shareholders of Bergen in connection with the Mergers and
the transactions contemplated thereby.   (c) Conduct of Bergen\'s
Operations. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, Bergen shall conduct its operations in the ordinary
course      53   except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain and preserve its business organization and to retain the
services of its officers and key employees and maintain relationships with
customers, suppliers, lessees, licensees and other third parties to the end
that its goodwill and ongoing business shall not be impaired in any material
respect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Bergen shall not,
except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or as set forth in Section 6.3(c) to the
Bergen Disclosure Schedule, without the prior written consent of AmeriSource
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld):   (i) do or effect any of the
following actions with respect to its securities: (A) adjust, split, combine
or reclassify its capital stock, (B) make, declare or pay any dividend (other
than regular quarterly dividends on Bergen Common Stock of $0.01 per share
with record and payment dates consistent with past practice) or distribution
on, or directly or indirectly redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, any
shares of its capital stock or any securities or obligations convertible into
or exchangeable for any shares of its capital stock, (C) grant any person any
right or option to acquire any shares of its capital stock (provided that
Bergen may grant Bergen Options to purchase shares of Bergen Common Stock if
such grants are made at such times and in such amounts as are consistent with
previous grants by Bergen in the ordinary course of business ("Additional
Bergen Options") and if the Additional Bergen Options provide that the
consummation of the Mergers shall not be an event which accelerates the
vesting thereof), (D) issue, deliver or sell or agree to issue, deliver or
sell any additional shares of its capital stock or any other securities or
obligations convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of
its capital stock or such securities (except pursuant to the exercise of
Bergen Options which are outstanding as of the date hereof or which are
granted by Bergen prior to the Effective Time in compliance with the terms of
this Agreement) or (E) enter into any agreement, understanding or
arrangement with respect to the sale, voting, registration or repurchase of
its capital stock;   (ii) directly or indirectly sell, transfer, lease,
pledge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of its material
property or assets other than inventory in the ordinary course of
business;   (iii) amend the Bergen Certificate or the Bergen Bylaws;  
(iv) merge or consolidate with any other person;   (v) acquire assets (other
than inventory in the ordinary course of business) or capital stock of or
other equity interests in any other person or persons valued, giving effect
to assumed indebtedness, at more than $100 million in the aggregate; provided
that Bergen shall give AmeriSource written notice of any acquisition of
assets or capital stock of or other equity interests in any other person,
regardless of the size of the transaction, at least six business days prior
to the filing of any application under the HSR Act with respect thereto or,
if no such filing is made, at least six business days prior to the entering
into of any agreement to make such an acquisition, provided the agreement is
contingent on compliance with this paragraph (v), and provided, further, that
Bergen shall not make any acquisition of (A) any entity engaged in the U.S.
pharmaceutical distribution business (as defined below) or (B) any
other    54   business, regardless of the size of the transaction, if
(x) in the case of clause (A), either Bergen\'s outside antitrust counsel or
AmeriSource\'s outside antitrust counsel shall, within five business days of
receipt of the aforesaid notice, deliver to Bergen its written opinion that
such acquisition would materially and adversely affect the ability of Section
7.1(b), 7.1(c) and 7.1(d) (insofar as they relate to federal Antitrust Laws)
to be satisfied or would result in any material delay in the timing of the
satisfaction of such Sections (Bergen agreeing promptly to provide
AmeriSource\'s counsel with all information, analyses and materials available
to Bergen in connection with such acquisition that would be reasonably
necessary in formulating its opinion); and (y) in the case of clause (B), if
such acquisition would materially and adversely affect the ability of Section
7.1(b), 7.1(c) and 7.1(d) (insofar as they relate to federal Antitrust Laws)
to be satisfied or would result in any material delay in the timing of the
satisfaction of such Sections; (for the purposes of this Section 6.3(c)(v)
only, an entity shall be deemed to be engaged in the U.S. pharmaceutical
distribution business if it derived at least $100 million in revenues from
the pharmaceutical distribution business (and shall have more than $25
million of revenues in the U.S. or $15 million in assets in the U.S.) in
its fiscal year preceding the date of the agreement or filing referred to
above (it being understood that, with respect to joint ventures or newly
formed entities, the revenues of such entity for a fiscal year will include

subsidiaries or any of its or its subsidiaries\' directors, officers,
employees, agents or representatives, directly or indirectly, to solicit,
initiate, encourage or facilitate, or furnish or disclose any information in
furtherance of, any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to
any recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other business combination
involving Bergen, or acquisition of any capital stock from Bergen (other than
upon exercise of Bergen options which are outstanding as of the date hereof
or which have been granted by Bergen prior to the Effective Time in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement) or 15% or more of the assets of
Bergen and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions, or any acquisition by Bergen of any material
assets    56   or capital stock of any other person (other than to the
extent specifically permitted by Section 6.3(c)(v)), or any combination of
the foregoing (a "Bergen Competing Transaction"), or negotiate or otherwise
engage in discussions with any person (other than AmeriSource or its
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) with
respect to any Bergen Competing Transaction or enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Mergers or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided that, at any time prior to the approval of the Mergers by
the holders of shares of Bergen Common Stock, Bergen may furnish information
to, and negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, any party who
delivers a written proposal for a Bergen Competing Transaction which was not
solicited or encouraged after the date of this Agreement if and so long as
(i) the Board of Directors of Bergen determines in good faith by a majority
vote, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to take
such action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of Bergen under Applicable Law and determines after consulting with
Merrill Lynch (or any other nationally recognized investment banking firm),
that such proposal is more favorable to Bergen\'s shareholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by AmeriSource
in response to such Bergen Competing Transaction) and reasonably likely to be
consummated after taking into consideration all the terms and conditions of
such proposal (including the availability of financing, the conditions to
consummation and the likelihood of objections under applicable Antitrust
Laws) and (ii) prior to furnishing such information to, or entering into
negotiations or discussions with such party, Bergen uses its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from such party an executed confidentiality agreement on
terms no less favorable to Bergen than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement. Bergen will immediately cease all existing activities, discussions
and negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
proposal for a Bergen Competing Transaction. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section 6.3(d), in the event that prior to the approval of
the Mergers by the holders of shares of Bergen Common Stock the Board of
Directors of Bergen determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so
would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Bergen Board of
Directors under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Bergen may (subject
to this and the following sentences) withdraw, modify or change, in a manner
adverse to AmeriSource, the Bergen Board Recommendation and take and disclose
to the holders of shares of Bergen Common Stock a position with respect to
the Bergen Competing Transaction and, to the extent applicable, comply with
Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a Bergen
Competing Transaction by disclosing such withdrawn, modified or changed
Bergen Board Recommendation and recommendation with respect to the Bergen
Competing Transaction in connection with a tender or exchange offer for
Bergen securities, provided that it uses its reasonable best efforts to give
AmeriSource two days prior written notice of its intention to do so. The
Bergen Board of Directors shall not, in connection with any such withdrawal,
modification or change of the Bergen Board Recommendation, take any action to
change the approval of the Board of Directors of Bergen for purposes of
causing any state takeover statute or other state law or the Bergen Rights
Agreement to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including
this Agreement, the Bergen Stock Option Agreement, the Bergen Support
Agreements and the Mergers, provided, however, that this sentence shall not
prohibit Bergen from withdrawing, modifying or changing its recommendation or
approving or recommending any Bergen Competing Transaction under the
circumstances and subject to the   57   conditions set forth in this
Section 6.3(d). Notwithstanding any subsequent determination by the Board of
Directors of Bergen to change the Bergen Board Recommendation, this Agreement
shall be submitted to the holders of shares of Bergen Common Stock at the
Bergen Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Bergen of such
obligation. From and after the execution of this Agreement, Bergen shall
immediately advise AmeriSource in writing of the receipt, directly or
indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations, or
proposals relating to a Bergen Competing Transaction (including the specific
terms thereof and the identity of the other party or parties involved) and
furnish to AmeriSource as promptly as practicable, and in any event within
two days of such receipt, an accurate description of all material terms
(including any changes or adjustments to such terms as a result of
negotiations or otherwise) of any such written proposal in addition to any
information provided to any third party relating thereto.   (e) Affiliates
of Bergen. Bergen shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person
who may be at the Effective Time or was on the date hereof an "affiliate" of
Bergen for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act to execute and
deliver to Parent no less than 30 days prior to the date of the Bergen
Shareholders Meeting, the written undertakings in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit D (the "Bergen Affiliate Letter"). No later than 45 days prior to the
date of the Bergen Shareholders Meeting, Bergen, after consultation with its
outside counsel, shall provide Parent with a letter (reasonably
satisfactory to outside counsel to Parent) specifying all of the persons or
entities who, in Bergen\'s opinion, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of
Bergen under the preceding sentence. Bergen shall provide Parent with such
information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of
reviewing such letter. The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent shall be
entitled to place legends as specified in the Bergen Affiliate Letter on the
certificates evidencing any of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
received by (i) any such "affiliate" of Bergen specified in such letter or
(ii) any person Parent reasonably identifies (by written notice to Bergen) as
being a person who may be deemed an "affiliate" for purposes of Rule 145
under the Securities Act, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to
issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the
shares of Parent Common Stock, consistent with the terms of the Bergen
Affiliate Letter, regardless of whether such person has executed the Bergen
Affiliate Letter and regardless of whether such person\'s name appears on the
letter to be delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence. Promptly upon
the request of the holder of such certificates, Parent will issue new
certificates with no legends, and will countermand the stop transfer
instructions, consistent with the terms of the Bergen Affiliate Letter.  
(f) Access. Bergen shall permit representatives of AmeriSource to
have appropriate access at all reasonable times to Bergen\'s premises,
properties, books, records, contracts and documents and shall cause its
independent public accountants to give AmeriSource access to such
accountants\' work papers; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
require Bergen to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that
in the reasonable judgment of Bergen would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties, the loss of any applicable attorney- client
privilege or violate any of their obligations with respect to confidentiality
so long as such party shall have used reasonable efforts to obtain approval
to such inspection or disclosure of such information. Information obtained by
AmeriSource pursuant to this Section 6.3(f) shall be subject to the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which    58   agreement
remains in full force and effect. No investigation conducted pursuant to this
Section 6.3(f) or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Bergen shall have no obligation to provide AmeriSource
with information if Bergen determines in good faith, upon written advice of
its outside antitrust counsel, that providing such information may violate
any Applicable Law.   (g) Notification of Certain Matters. Bergen shall
give prompt notice to AmeriSource of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would likely cause any
Bergen representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time in any material respect and
(ii) any material failure of Bergen to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.3(g) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to AmeriSource.   (h) Subsequent Financial Statements. Bergen shall consult
with AmeriSource prior to making publicly available its financial results for
any period after the date of this Agreement and prior to filing any Bergen
SEC Documents after the date of this Agreement, it being understood that
AmeriSource shall have no liability by reason of such consultation.   (i)
Letters of Accountants. Bergen shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
to be delivered to Parent and AmeriSource "comfort" letters of Deloitte and
Touche LLP, Bergen\'s independent public accountants, dated a date within two
business days before the date on which the Registration Statement shall
become effective, the date the Joint Proxy Statement is mailed and the date
of the AmeriSource Shareholders Meeting and addressed to Parent
and AmeriSource, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to AmeriSource
and reasonably customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection with registration statements
similar to the Registration Statement.   (j) Purchases of Common Stock of
AmeriSource. During the period from the date hereof through the Effective
Time, neither Bergen nor any of its subsidiaries will purchase any shares of
AmeriSource Common Stock other than pursuant to the AmeriSource Stock Option
Agreement.   (k) Bergen Options. The Bergen Board of Directors shall, on or
prior to the Effective Time, take all actions necessary to provide that:  
(i) all Bergen Options granted prior to February 15, 2001 shall vest as of
the close of business on the last business day prior to the
Effective Time;   (ii) the exercise period of such Bergen Options shall be
amended to provide that such Bergen Options shall not become exercisable
until one year from the Effective Time; provided, that the foregoing
restriction on the exercise of Bergen Options shall not apply to any Bergen
Options which were already vested at the Effective Time or would otherwise
become vested during such restricted period under the terms of the relevant
Bergen option plan absent clause (i) above;   59    (iii) in the case of
termination of the option holder for cause, the exercise period of such
Bergen Options shall be as currently set forth in the relevant Bergen option
plan; and   (iv) in all cases other than termination of the option holder
for cause, the exercise period of such Bergen Options shall extend until the
later of (i) 13 months from the Effective Time (subject to extension pursuant
to the insider trading policy of Parent if such policy restricts transactions
in the securities of Parent) or (ii) the end of the exercise period of such
Bergen Options as currently set forth in the relevant Bergen option plan.  
(l) Amendments to SERP and CAP. The Bergen Board of Directors shall, at least
91 days prior to the Effective Time, take all actions necessary to amend the
Bergen Fourth Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(the "Bergen SERP") and the Restated Bergen Capital Accumulation Plan
(the "Bergen CAP"), and any and all documents related to the Bergen SERP and
the Bergen CAP, including the Master Trust Agreement for Bergen
Corporation Executive Deferral Plans dated as of December 27, 1994 between
Bergen and Wachovia Bank of North Carolina, N.A., in order to effectuate the
agreements between the executives listed in Section 4.16(1) to the Disclosure
Schedule in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E.   (m) Rights Agreement.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, Bergen
shall amend the Bergen Rights Agreement so that (i) Parent and AmeriSource
are exempt from the definition of "Acquiring Person" contained in the Bergen
Rights Agreement, (ii) no "Stock Acquisition Date" or "Distribution Date" (as
such terms are defined in the Bergen Rights Agreement) will occur as a result
of the execution of this Agreement or the Bergen Stock Option Agreement or
the consummation of the Mergers pursuant to this Agreement or the acquisition
or transfer of shares of Bergen Common Stock by AmeriSource pursuant to the
Bergen Stock Option Agreement and (iii) the Bergen Rights Agreement will
expire immediately prior to the Effective Time. Bergen shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Bergen Rights Agreement, as so amended, is not
further amended or modified. Bergen shall provide copies of all
such amendments to the Bergen Rights Agreement to AmeriSource promptly after
the execution thereof.   ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS   7.1. Conditions to
the Obligations of Each Party. The obligations of Bergen and AmeriSource to
consummate the Mergers shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following
conditions:   (a) (i) This Agreement shall have been approved and adopted by

shares of AmeriSource Class A Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, in each
case in the manner required by all Applicable Laws and the applicable stock
exchange rules.   60    (b) Any applicable waiting periods (and any
extensions thereof, including any written commitment to an HSR Authority to
defer or delay consummation of the Mergers notwithstanding expiration of such
waiting periods) under the HSR Act relating to the Mergers and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have expired or been
terminated.   (c) No provision of any Applicable Law (other than Antitrust
Laws), as supported by written opinion of outside legal counsel, and no
judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit or enjoin the
consummation of the Mergers or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the parties having used their respective reasonable best efforts
(consistent with the provisions of this Agreement) to cause such Applicable
Law to be satisfied (if such Applicable Law is capable of being satisfied) so
as to cause such Applicable Law not to prohibit the Mergers or the
transactions contemplated hereby).   (d) There shall not be pending any
Action by any Governmental Authority (i) challenging or seeking to restrain
or prohibit the consummation of the Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit the
ownership or operation by Parent, AmeriSource, Bergen or any of their
respective subsidiaries of, or to compel Parent, AmeriSource, Bergen or any
of their respective subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate, any material
portion of the business or assets of Parent, AmeriSource, Bergen or any of
their respective subsidiaries, as a result of the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) seeking to prohibit
Parent or any subsidiary of Parent from effectively controlling in any
material respect the business or operations of AmeriSource, Bergen or their
subsidiaries after the Effective Time.   (e) The Commission shall have

issued in the Mergers shall have been approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance.   (g) The Financial Accounting

respects as in the Exposure Draft of the proposed Statement entitled Business
Combinations and Intangible Assets - Accounting for Goodwill, dated February
14, 2001.   7.2. Conditions to Obligations of Bergen. The obligations of
Bergen to consummate the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be subject to the fulfillment of the following conditions unless waived
by Bergen:   (a) The representations and warranties of AmeriSource set forth
in Article V (which for purposes of this paragraph (a) shall be read as

qualifier) shall be true and correct in all respects on and as of the Closing

(except for such representations and warranties made as of a specified date,
the accuracy of which will   61   be determined as of the specified

failure of the representations and warranties in the aggregate to be true and
correct in all respects would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
AmeriSource.   (b) AmeriSource shall have performed in all material respects
each obligation and agreement and shall have complied in all material
respects with each covenant to be performed and complied with by it hereunder
at or prior to the Effective Time, except, in the case of breaches of Section

Closing Date, based upon certain factual representations of Bergen
and AmeriSource reasonably requested by such counsel, to the effect that
neither Bergen nor the Bergen shareholders will recognize any gain or loss
for federal income tax purposes in connection with the Mergers, except to the
extent that cash may be received in lieu of Fractional Shares and to the
extent of payments made pursuant to Section 6.1(i).   7.3. Conditions to
Obligations of AmeriSource. The obligations of AmeriSource to consummate the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to

such representations and warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy
of which will be determined as of the specified date), except for changes
permitted by Section 6.3(c) and except where the failure of the
representations and warranties in the aggregate to be true and correct in all
respects would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Bergen.   (b) Bergen
shall have performed in all material respects each obligation and agreement
and shall have complied in all material respects with each covenant to be
