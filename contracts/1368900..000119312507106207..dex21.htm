(vii) except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, any and all liabilities

(viii) any and all obligations, liabilities and/or commitments, including but
not limited to obligations, liabilities and/or commitments pursuant to
Environmental Laws, arising out of or related to conditions or events arising
from or related to the Real Property and/or the operation of the Newspapers
thereon that occurred on or prior to the Closing Date. The obligations,
liabilities and/or commitments contemplated by this Section 1.3(b)(viii)
include, but are not limited to, all matters arising from or relating to (I)
Item 6 of Schedule 3.17 and any required investigation or remediation relating
thereto, and (II) Items 2, 5 and 8 of Schedule 3.17 and all facts and
circumstances underlying or leading to such implementation or that made such
implementation necessary.

1.4 _Consideration_. Subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement,
and in consideration of the sale of the Assets, Buyer will pay on the Closing
Date the sum of Three Hundred Seventeen Million dollars ($317,000,000) (the
"Base Purchase Price"), as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.6 below (the
"Purchase Price").



 

8 1.5 _Manner of Payment_. The Purchase Price shall be paid to Sellers on the
Closing Date in immediately available funds by wire transfer to bank accounts
designated by Sellers in writing at least two (2) business days prior to the
Closing Date.



   1.6 | _Adjustments_. 
---|--- 

(a) _Issues Prior to the Closing Date_. Sellers shall be entitled to all
income earned and be responsible for all expenses incurred in connection with
the business and operation of the Newspapers on or prior to the Closing Date.
Buyer shall be entitled to all income earned and be responsible for all
expenses incurred in connection with the business and operation of the
Newspapers after the Closing Date.

(b)  _Other Adjustments_. All items of income and expense directly relating
to the business of operating the Newspapers, other than the income and
expenses referred to above, shall be prorated between Sellers and Buyer as of
the close of business on the Closing Date. Such items to be prorated shall
include, without limitation, power and utility charges, personal property
taxes and real property taxes. The portion of any personal property taxes and
real property taxes for a taxable period that includes the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period") that shall be deemed to be payable for the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date shall be the amount of such taxes for the
entire period (or, in the case of such taxes determined on an arrears basis,
the amount of such taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of calendar days in the entire period. The portion of any other taxes for a
Straddle Period that shall be deemed to be payable for the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined based on an interim
closing of the books to the extent practicable and otherwise based on the
formula described in the immediately preceding sentence.

(c) _Balance Sheet Test_. If on the Closing Date the Newspapers current
assets which are included in the Assets exceed the total liabilities set forth
on the  



 

9  Closing Date Balance Sheets (as defined below), the Base Purchase Price will
be increased by such excess. If on the Closing Date the Newspapers
total liabilities set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet exceed the
Newspapers current assets which are included in the Assets, the Base Purchase
Price will be reduced by such excess. The calculations described above are
referred to herein as the "Balance Sheet Tests". In computing the adjustment
described above, the Closing Date Balance Sheets shall be prepared in
accordance with Sellers historical accounting practices which reflect accrual
basis accounting and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles other than as set forth on _Schedule 1.6(c)_. The accounts
receivable shall be included net of an agreed upon reserve. All intercompany
and affiliate receivables or liabilities will be treated as shareholders
equity and will be excluded from the balance sheet adjustment and will not be
assumed by Buyer. All prepaid advertising shall be accrued as liabilities in
the amount of such prepayments.

(d) _Adjustment Calculations_. Three (3) business days prior to the Closing
Date, to the extent practicable, the adjustments provided in this Section 1.6
shall be made to the Base Purchase Price on the basis of the then most
recently available financial statements of the Newspapers, which shall be
reflected on a preliminary balance sheet for each Newspaper (each a
"Preliminary Balance Sheet" and together, the "Preliminary Balance Sheets")
prepared by Sellers. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Sellers will
prepare an adjusted balance sheet for each Newspaper (each a "Closing Date
Balance Sheet" and together, the "Closing Date Balance Sheets") as of the
close of business on the Closing Date, reflecting the adjustments provided in
this Section 1.6 and showing the recalculation of adjustments reflected on
the Preliminary Balance Sheets, along with back-up materials necessary for
Buyers understanding of the Closing Date Balance Sheets and the calculation
thereof. Sellers and their accountants will provide Buyers accountants with
reasonable access to the books, records and working papers of Sellers
necessary to review such calculations. Within 120 days after the Closing Date,

arises over the amount to be refunded or paid, such refund or payment shall
nonetheless be promptly made to the extent such amount is not in dispute. If

Balance Sheets that Buyer disputes the information contained therein, then,
Buyer shall be deemed to agree to the Closing Date Balance Sheets and to have
waived all further right to dispute the information contained therein and its
use in applying the provisions of this Agreement. If Buyer does notify Sellers
of a dispute regarding the Closing Date Balance Sheets within 30 days of
receiving it, and if such dispute cannot be resolved by the parties within 30
days thereafter, it shall be referred to a mutually satisfactory independent

either party for the two years preceding the Closing Date. The determination
of such firm shall be conclusive and binding on each party and any required

ARTICLE III.

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS_

The Gannett Parties, jointly and severally, and the Media West Parties, as
appropriate, represent and warrant to Buyer as follows:

3.1 _Organization; Qualification_. Each Seller is a corporation validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation.
The Gannett Parties have the full power and authority to own and operate the
Assets (excluding the Mastheads) and carry on the business operations of
the Newspapers as such operations are now being conducted. The Media West
Parties have the full power and authority to own the Mastheads. Each Seller
(a) is duly qualified to do business and in good standing, and is duly
licensed, authorized or qualified to transact business in each jurisdiction
in which the ownership or lease of real property or the conduct of its
business requires it to be so qualified, and (b) has all government licenses,
Permits, approvals and other authorizations necessary to own its properties
and assets and carry on its  



 

13  business as it is now being conducted, except such licenses, Permits,
approvals and other authorizations described in clauses (a) and (b) the
lack of which would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section
3.4).

3.2 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Each Seller has the full power,
authority and legal right to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions and perform its obligations as contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary action, and this Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by each Seller and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Buyer, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Seller enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law affecting
the rights of creditors generally. 

3.3 _Financial Statements_. _Schedule 3.3_ sets forth (a) the unaudited
financial statements of the Newspapers for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2006 and (b) unaudited financial statements for the period through March 4,
2007 (the "Balance Sheet Date") (the financial statements referred to in
clauses (a) and (b) being "Financial Statements"). The representations and
warranties in this Section 3.3 are qualified by the pro forma adjustments
which were made in the Financial Statements pursuant to adjustments shown on
_Schedule 3.3_ furnished to Buyer, including: (x) pension plan expense was
eliminated, (y) newsprint expense was adjusted to approximate market price,
and (z) intercompany allocations for the Gannett News Service have been
eliminated. The Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects
the financial position of the Newspapers and the results of operations of the
Newspapers as at and for the periods covered thereby and have been prepared in
conformity with Sellers historical accounting practices which reflect
accrual basis accounting and are in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, except as otherwise noted therein or as set forth on
_Schedule 1.6(c)_. No material adjustments of the Financial Statements are
required for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial
position of the Newspapers on an accrual basis. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.3_ , the Financial Statements are correct and complete in
accordance with the books and records regularly maintained by the Newspapers
which reflect accrual basis accounting. The Financial Statements fairly
present the results of operations and financial position of the Newspapers as
of the dates and for the periods set forth therein. Sellers  



 

14  shall deliver on the Closing Date to Buyer a schedule of the Newspapers
outstanding accounts receivable as of the Closing Date. All such
accounts receivable have arisen in the ordinary course of business and
represent bona fide indebtedness incurred by the applicable account debtor and
have been properly adjusted for bankrupt and other uncollectible accounts.
Assuming reasonable collection efforts by Buyer, Sellers have no reason to
believe that such accounts receivable would not be collectible (net of
Sellers reserves for uncollectible receivables established by Sellers in the
ordinary course of its business consistent with past practice). Sellers make
no representations, however, about the future business or financial prospects
of the Newspapers for Buyers intended purposes.

3.4 _Business Since the Balance Sheet Date_. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.15_ , since the Balance Sheet Date, the business of the Newspapers has been
conducted in the ordinary course of business and in substantially the same
manner as it was before the Balance Sheet Date. Since the Balance Sheet Date,
there has been no change in the business, condition (financial or otherwise),
properties or operations of the Newspapers or other event or occurrence which
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the business, operations, properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Newspapers taken as a whole ("Material Adverse Effect") as of the Closing
Date.

3.5 _No Defaults_.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Sellers will
not (i) conflict with any provision of the Certificates of Incorporation or
Bylaws of any Seller, (ii) result in a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration), with notice or passage of time or
both, under or conflict with any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Material Contract (as defined in Section 3.9), note, bond, mortgage or other
instrument, obligation or agreement relating to the business of the Newspapers
or to which any of the Assets may be subject, and which default or conflict,
singly or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (iii) violate any law, statute, rule, regulation,
order, injunction or decree of any federal, state or local governmental
authority or agency applicable to Seller or any of the Assets, or (iv) result
in the creation or imposition of any Lien of any nature whatsoever on any of
the Assets.



 

15 (b) Except for the required consents with respect to the contracts referred to
in Section 3.9 and the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "Hart-Scott-Rodino Act"), Sellers
are not required to submit any notice, report or other filing with, or obtain
any consent, approval or waiver from, any governmental or regulatory
authority or instrumentality or any other third party in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by Sellers or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except where failure to
give such notice, report or other filing, or to obtain such consent, approval
or waiver would have no, and would not be reasonably expected to have a,
Material Adverse Effect.

3.6 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. No Seller has any material obligation or
liability to be reflected or reserved against in any of the
Financial Statements which is not fully reflected or reserved against in such
Financial Statements except for liabilities which have arisen after the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business.

3.7 _Licenses and Authorizations_. All licenses, Permits and authorizations
required to own the Assets and to conduct the business of the Newspapers are
held by Sellers and are in full force and effect with no violations of any of
them having occurred, other than violations that would not have, and would be
reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed
in  _Schedule 3.12_, no proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of
Sellers, threatened in writing, seeking the revocation or limitation of any
such license, Permit or other authorization.

3.8 _Condition and Adequacy of the Assets; Title_. The tangible assets
included in the Assets are in adequate operating condition and
repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and are adequate and suitable in
accordance with general industry practices for the purposes for which they are
currently used. Each Seller has good and marketable title to all of the Assets
which it purports to own free and clear of all security interests, mortgages,
conditional sales agreements, charges, liens and other encumbrances ("Liens"),
except for Permitted Encumbrances . All inventory of each Seller included in
the Assets is useful in the ordinary course of such Sellers business.
Without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing, except as indicated
on _Schedule 3.8_ , no Seller uses furniture, fixtures, equipment, inventory
or supplies in connection with the operation of the Newspapers which it does
not own. Except for the Excluded Assets,  



 

16  the Assets are, in the aggregate, all of the assets which are necessary to
operate the Newspapers in the manner in which the Newspapers were operated
during the 12-month period ending on the Balance Sheet Date and since such
time, except for additions thereto and deletions therefrom in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practice.

3.9 _Contracts and Arrangements_. _Schedule 3.9_ hereto lists all of the
contracts, agreements and arrangements of the Newspapers previously furnished
to Buyer. As used herein, "Material Contracts" means all of the following
contracts, agreements and arrangements (written or oral) included in the
Assets involving annual consideration of more than $25,000:

(a) Sales agency or advertising representation contracts;

(b) Contracts for the future construction or purchase of capital improvements,
purchase of materials, supplies or equipment, or for the sale of assets;

(c) Consulting contracts, employment agreements or freelance agreements;

(d) Licenses or agreements under which Seller is authorized to publish

(e) Leases of real and personal property (collectively, the "Leases"); and

(f) Any other contract or lease not made in the usual and ordinary course of
business, or not terminable by Sellers without liability upon not more than 90
days written notice.

All of the Material Contracts are listed on _Schedule 3.9_. _Schedule 3.9_
specifies those Material Contracts, the assignment of which requires the
consent of a third party. Provided that any requisite consent to the
assignment of Material Contracts to Buyer is obtained, to the knowledge of
Sellers, each of the contracts and leases which is assigned to and assumed by
Buyer on the Closing Date is valid and in full force and effect. There is
no existing default, event of default or other event under such Material
Contracts which, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or an event of default by a Seller under any such
contract. To the knowledge of Sellers, there is not, under any of the
Material Contracts, any existing default or event of default which, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default or event of
default on the part of any other party thereto, except such defaults, events
of default and other events which would not have, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the Closing Date,
Sellers will make available to Buyer complete copies (or written summaries
of oral contracts) of all of the Material Contracts.

(a) The representations and warranties of the parties contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the date
hereof and on the Closing Date, shall survive the Closing Date and shall
remain operative and in full force and effect for the period ending twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date (the "Survival Period"); provided that if
on or prior to the expiration of the Survival Period, a notice of claim for
indemnification shall have been given in accordance with Section 9.4 hereof,
the indemnified party shall continue to have the right to be indemnified with
respect to such indemnification claim until such claim for indemnification has
been satisfied or otherwise  



 

33  resolved as provided in this Article IX; and provided further that the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.17 (Environmental
Matters) and 3.18 (Circulation) shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations period plus 90 days and the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 3.2 (Sellers Authority), 3.16

made by any party hereunder which are to be performed after the Closing Date
shall survive without time limit, with the exception of Sections 9.2(a) and
9.3(a), which shall only remain operative and in full force and effect as long
as indemnification with respect to the underlying representation and warranty

9.1(a) (including as extended pursuant to the first proviso hereof).

(b) Except for any Loss and Expense suffered by Buyer based on the breach of
any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.17 (Environmental) and
Section 3.18 (Circulation), Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement for any indemnification claim under Section 9.2(a) until
the aggregate Loss and Expense (as defined herein) suffered by Buyer subject
to indemnification under Section 9.2(a) of this Agreement and/or Section
9.2(a) of the Utica Asset Purchase Agreement exceeds $500,000 (the
"Threshold"). Once the Threshold has been reached, Buyer shall be entitled to
indemnification from the Gannett Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(a) below for
any additional Loss and Expense suffered by Buyer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Threshold shall not apply to any adjustments under Section 1.6,

performed after the Closing Date.

which are to be performed after the Closing Date. Except with regard to
compensation for claims paid to third parties, no indemnifying party shall
have any liability to an indemnified party for any punitive, indirect,
incidental or consequential damages or loss including, without limitation,
loss of revenue or loss of profits.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Sellers shall have no obligation to defend, indemnify or hold harmless Buyer
for any Loss and Expense related to or arising out of any Environmental Law
with regard to Item 9 of Schedule 3.17 (and any required remediation relating
thereto) to the extent GANSAT is prevented from completing its obligations
under the Site Access Agreement due to Buyers breach of or failure to comply
with the terms of the Site Access Agreement.

(e) Except for equitable remedies (including, without limitation, injunctive
relief) and in the absence of fraud, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer and Seller, as the case may be,
from and after the Closing Date with respect to any Loss and Expense
whatsoever and any and all claims for breach or liability under this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be solely in
accordance with, and limited by, the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article IX.

9.2 _Indemnification of Buyer_. The Gannett Parties agree that they shall
indemnify, defend and hold Buyer harmless from and against any and
all damages, claims, losses, expenses, costs, obligations and liabilities,
including without limitation, liabilities for reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements ("Loss and Expense"), suffered directly or indirectly by Buyer
by reason of, or arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement, provided that, solely for purposes of this Article IX, any
representation or warranty of Sellers contained herein that is subject to a
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification shall not be so qualified
for purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred;



 

35 (b) any failure by any Seller to perform or fulfill any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement;

(c) any failure by any Seller to pay or perform when due any of its
liabilities or obligations arising out of or related to the business of the
Newspapers on or prior to the Closing Date which have not been assumed by
Buyer hereunder, including, but not limited to, the Excluded Liabilities;

(d) any litigation, proceeding or claim by any third party relating to the
business or operations of any of the Newspapers on or prior to the Closing
Date;

(e) the Excluded Assets;

(f) any liability, including but not limited to any liability pursuant to any
Environmental Law, arising from or related to conditions or events that
occurred prior to the Closing arising from or related to the ownership of the
Real Property and/or the operations of the Newspapers on the Real Property on
or prior to the Closing Date.

9.3 _Indemnification of Sellers_. Buyer agrees that it shall indemnify,
defend and hold each Seller harmless from and against any and all Loss and
Expense suffered directly or indirectly by such Seller by reason of, or
arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement;

(b) any failure by Buyer to perform or fulfill any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement;

(c) any failure by Buyer to pay or discharge on or subsequent to the Closing
Date any Assumed Liabilities hereunder or any liabilities or
obligations arising out of or related to the business of the Newspapers
incurred or first required to be performed by Buyer after the Closing Date; or

(d) any litigation, proceeding or claim by any third party relating to the
business or operation of any of the Newspapers after the Closing Date.

9.4 _Notice of Claims_. If any Sellers or Buyer believes that it has suffered
or incurred any Loss and Expense, it shall notify the other party promptly in
writing and within the applicable time period specified in Section 9.1,
describing such Loss and Expense, the amount thereof, if known, and the method
of computation of such Loss and Expense, all with reasonable  



 

36  particularity and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement
in respect of which such Loss and Expense shall have occurred;
provided, however, that the amount of the Loss and Expense set forth in the
notice shall not be a limitation on any claim for the actual amount of such
Loss and Expense.

9.5 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If any action at law or suit in equity is
instituted by a third party (a "Claim") with respect to which any of the
parties intends to claim a Loss and Expense under this Article IX, such party
shall promptly notify the indemnifying party of such action or suit. The
indemnifying party shall have the right to conduct and control any Claim
through counsel of its own choosing, but the indemnified party may, at its
election, participate in the defense of any such Claim at its sole cost and
expense. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party
within 10 days after receipt of the notice specified in this Section 9.5 that
it is defending any such Claim, then the indemnified party may defend such
Claim, and settle such Claim, through counsel of its own choosing, and recover
from the indemnifying party the amount of any such settlement or of any
judgment and the costs and expenses of such defense, including, but not
limited to, reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure by a party to abide by these terms
and conditions shall not affect the other partys obligations to indemnify
such party against Loss and Expense under this Article IX, except to the
extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced thereby.

9.6 _Losses Net of Insurance_. The amount of any Loss and Expense for which
indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the indemnified party under insurance policies with
respect to such Loss and Expense and after giving effect to any retroactive
premium increases or any other retroactive charges with respect to such
insurance policies.

ARTICLE X.

_MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

10.1 _Risk of Loss_. The risk of any loss, damage or destruction to any of
the Assets to be transferred to Buyer hereunder from any cause shall be borne
by Sellers at all times prior to the Closing hereunder. Upon the occurrence of
any loss or damage in excess of $500,000 to any  



 

37  of the Assets to be transferred hereunder prior to the Closing, Sellers
shall notify Buyer of same in writing immediately stating with particularity
the extent of the loss or damage incurred, the cause thereof if known and the
extent to which restoration, replacement and repair of the Assets lost or
destroyed will be reimbursed under any insurance policy with respect thereto.
In the event the loss exceeds $5,000,000 and the Assets cannot be
substantially repaired or restored within 90 days after such loss, Buyer shall
have the option, exercisable by giving written notice to Sellers within 30
days after such loss, to:

(a) Terminate this Agreement;

(b) Postpone the Closing until such time as the Assets have been
substantially repaired, replaced or restored; or

(c) Elect to consummate the Closing and accept the Assets in their "then"
condition, in which event Sellers shall assign to Buyer all rights under any
insurance claim covering the loss and pay over to Buyer any proceeds under any
such insurance policy thereto received by Sellers with respect thereto.

10.2 _Abandonment of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated by Sellers
or Buyer at any time prior to the Closing Date:

(a) by the mutual consent of both parties hereto; or

(b) by Sellers if any of the conditions provided in Article VII hereof has not
been timely met and cannot be met on or before June 30, 2007 (other than as a
result of a breach of this Agreement by Sellers) and has not been waived,
provided Sellers are not then in material breach of this Agreement; or

(c) by Buyer if any of the conditions provided in Article VIII hereof has not
been timely met by and cannot be met on or before June 30, 2007 (other than as
a result of a breach of this Agreement by Buyer) and has not been waived,
provided Buyer is not then in material breach of this Agreement.

10.3 _Liabilities Upon Abandonment_. In the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 10.2 above, no party hereto shall have any
liability to any other party for costs, expenses, damages, loss of anticipated
profits or otherwise, unless the termination occurs because of
any misrepresentation or breach of warranty by such party or the failure of
performance of, or compliance with, any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement by such party; provided, that if Sellers terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2(b)  



 

38  because Buyer has not delivered the Purchase Price at Closing or has
otherwise breached any of its material obligations under this Agreement or if
Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2(c) because Sellers
have not delivered the Assets at Closing or have otherwise breached their
material obligations under this Agreement, then Buyer or Sellers, as the case
may be, shall pay the other party on demand an amount equal to ten percent
(10%) of the Base Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, and such payment shall constitute liquidated damages and the sole
remedy of Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, under this Agreement. The
party that has failed to perform acknowledges and agrees that the other
partys recovery of such amount shall constitute payment of liquidated damages
and not a penalty and that such liquidated damages amount is reasonable in
light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by
the party that has failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the
difficulty of proof of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-
feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the
transactions to be consummated hereunder.

10.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby will be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses. All costs
necessary to transfer the Assets to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall be
paid by Buyer. Any sales or use taxes or recording or transfer taxes or fees
directly related to transferring the Assets to Buyer ("Transfer Taxes") shall
be paid by Buyer. The cost of title insurance for the real property purchased
by Buyer hereunder shall be paid by Buyer. Buyer shall also reimburse Sellers
for all costs and expenses incurred by Sellers and their affiliates in
connection with Ernst and Young LLPs audit of each Newspapers financial
statements for the three years ending December 31, 2006.

10.5 _Employees and Employee Benefits_. 

(a) Buyer hereby agrees to offer employment, effective the day after the
Closing Date, to all individuals who are, on the Closing Date, active, full
or part-time employees (including employees on short-term leave) of any of the
Newspapers. With respect to each such employee to whom Buyer offers
employment, Buyer shall offer to employ such person at a base compensation
that is no less than the base compensation that was paid to such employee
immediately prior to Closing. Each employee of any of the Newspapers who
accepts employment with Buyer on the Closing Date is hereinafter referred to
as a "Transferred Employee".



 

39 (b) Except as set forth in subsection (a) above, Buyer, in its sole
discretion, shall determine what employee benefits will be made available to
Transferred Employees; provided, however, that Buyer will offer medical
coverage to Transferred Employees on and after the Closing Date, shall waive
for Transferred Employees any pre-existing condition limitations and waiting
periods that may apply under its health plans, and shall recognize Transferred
Employees service with Sellers or any of their respective affiliates as if it
were service with Buyer for purposes of satisfying any vesting requirements
under any benefit plans offered by Buyer (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual or for determining the amount of benefits payable under any benefit
plan other than a vacation plan).

(c) Buyer shall pay to each full-time Transferred Employee who is
involuntarily terminated by Buyer without cause during the twelve (12) month
period following the Closing Date separation payments equal to one (1) week
of pay for each year (or part thereof) of continuous employment with a Gannett
Party, their respective affiliates or the applicable Newspaper (without regard
to such Newspapers ownership) either prior to or after the Closing Date,
with a minimum of two (2) weeks of pay. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold Sellers harmless from and against all direct and indirect costs, expenses
or liabilities arising from or relating to claims made by Transferred
Employees with respect to termination of employment by Buyer after the Closing
Date, including, but not limited to, any claims for improper termination or
severance payments.

(d) Buyer shall be responsible for any obligations under federal, state or
local plant closing statutes, including the WARN Act, with respect to
events occurring after the Closing Date other than any such obligations
arising from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) The Gannett Parties shall be responsible for and timely pay all
compensation owed to the Transferred Employees and shall be responsible for
and timely provide Transferred Employees with all benefits owed under the  



 

40  Employee Benefit Programs through the Closing Date. The Gannett Parties will
retain all of the Employee Benefit Programs, including all employee
benefit plans and pension plans, and Buyer will not assume obligations under
any such programs. The Gannett Parties shall be fully and solely responsible
for any costs, expenses, obligations and liabilities arising out of the
pension or retirement obligations attributable to the Newspapers current or
former employees related to the period on or prior to the Closing Date.

10.6  _Further Assurances and Consents_.

(a) From time to time after the Closing Date, without further consideration,
each Seller will, at its expense, (i) execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, such documents to Buyer as Buyer may reasonably
request in order to effectively vest in Buyer good and valid (and, in the case
of Real Property, good and marketable) title to the Assets, and (ii) use
reasonable efforts to obtain any third-party consents to the assignment to
Buyer of the Material Contracts which require the consent of any third party
by reason of the transactions provided for in this Agreement and which were
not obtained by Seller on or before the Closing Date.

(b) From time to time after the Closing Date, Buyer will provide Sellers with
access, with reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to the
financial records of the Newspapers related to the period prior to the Closing
Date for use by Sellers in connection with tax and/or legal
proceedings related to the operation of the Newspapers prior to the Closing
Date. Buyer agrees to maintain all tax records related to the Newspapers for
all tax years that remain open as of the Closing Date unless and until (i)
Sellers notify Buyer in writing that any such tax year(s) has (have) been
closed or (ii) Buyer has given Sellers prior written notice of its intent to
destroy such records and Sellers have not reasonably and promptly requested
that such records not be destroyed. 

(c) If, in order to properly prepare its financial statements or documents to
be filed with any governmental authority or agency, it is necessary that any
party hereto be furnished with additional information relating to the Assets
or the Newspapers and such information is in the possession of any of the
other parties  



 

41  hereto, such party or parties agree to use its/their best efforts to furnish
such information to the requesting party without cost or expense to
the requesting party, unless it necessary for such party or parties to incur
third party expenses (e.g. legal or accounting fees) in connection with such
request in which case the requesting party shall reimburse the furnishing
party for such third party expenses. After the Closing Date, except to the
extent otherwise noted, Sellers,

on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall, to the extent
reasonably requested by the other: (i) assist in the preparation of tax
returns relating to the Assets and/or the Newspapers, (ii) cooperate in
preparing any audits by or disputes with any governmental authority,
including but not limited to, regarding any tax returns, (iii) at any time
after the execution of this Agreement, assist in the preparation of audited
financial statements to the extent they relate to, incorporate or rely upon
any information regarding the Assets and/or the Newspapers, including but not
limited to providing relevant work papers and any certification or
representation reasonably requested, (iv) make available information, records
and documents relating to taxes relating to the Assets and/or the Newspapers,
and (v) furnish copies of correspondence received from any governmental
authority in connection with any tax audit or information request relating to
the Assets and/or the Newspapers. 

10.7 _Waiver of Compliance_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation,
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be
waived by the other party only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting the waiver. Any such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with a term of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure to comply.

10.8  _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given when delivered by hand or by facsimile
transmission or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested), postage prepaid, to the parties at the following addresses (or at
such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

10.9 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of its terms shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not be assigned
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties.

10.10 _Like Kind Exchange_. Buyer agrees to permit the Gannett Parties and/or
the Media West Parties to assign their respective rights hereunder to a
"qualified intermediary" for this transaction as that term is used in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) and/or to use an "exchange accommodation
titleholder" under IRS Revenue Procedure 2000-37, and otherwise to cooperate
with such other parties to structure the sale as a like-kind exchange,
provided that none of the cooperating parties will be required to incur any
obligation, liability or expense (including without limitation any additional
tax liabilities) with respect to any such exchanges.

10.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without
reference to the choice of law principles thereof.

10.12 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing, no public announcement
(including an announcement to employees) or press release concerning the
transactions provided for herein shall be made by any party without the prior
written approval of the other parties, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. With respect to any disclosures required by
applicable law, rule or regulation, including disclosure requirements under
applicable securities laws and Current Reports on Form 8-K, each party will
consult with the other party and allow the other party to review the proposed
disclosure prior to making any such disclosures. In addition, in the event
Buyer, GateHouse or any of their respective affiliates sells any of
the Newspapers during the twelve (12) month period commencing on the Closing
Date, Buyer and GateHouse shall not, and shall cause their respective
affiliates not to, publicly disclose any information relating to the multiple
of such Newspapers EBITDA, cash flow, revenue or any other financial metric
of the Newspaper that the purchase price represents, other than disclosures
required by law.

10.13 _No Third Party Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
create any right on the part of any person or entity not a party to this
Agreement.



 

44 10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Sellers and Buyer specifically waive any right
to trial by jury in any court with respect to any contractual, tortious or
statutory claim, counterclaim or crossclaim against the other arising out of
or connected in any way to this Agreement because the parties hereto, each of
whom are represented by counsel, believe that the complex commercial aspects
of their dealing with one another make a jury determination neither desirable
nor appropriate.

10.15  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in identical
counterparts and each counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an original
instrument, but all counterparts hereof taken together shall constitute a
single document.

10.16 _Headings_. The article and section headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.

10.17 _Specific Performance_. Without limiting or waiving in any respect any
rights or remedies of Buyer or any of Sellers given under this Agreement, or
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute, Buyer and each
Seller shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the obligations to be
performed by Buyer or a Seller, as the case may be, in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement.

10.18 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof.

10.19 _Confidentiality_. Except as contemplated in Section 6.3, Sellers and
Buyer shall not disclose to third parties the terms of this Agreement except
as required by applicable law.

10.20 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto and the documents delivered hereunder, embodies the
entire agreement and understanding of the parties in respect of the subject
matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between
the parties. This Agreement may not be amended except in a writing signed by
both parties. The parties have caused this Agreement to be signed by their
respective duly authorized officers as of the date first above written. 



 

45 10.21 _GateHouse Guaranty_. GateHouse hereby guarantees to Sellers, as a
primary obligor, payment and performance by Buyer of its obligations under
this Agreement and under each of the other agreements contemplated hereunder
to which Buyer is a party (including without limitation, all amendments hereof
and thereof), in each case, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations
hereof and thereof. GateHouse hereby waives suretyship defenses, demand,
payment, protest and notice of dishonor or nonperformance of any such
obligations (other than any copies of notices required to be delivered under
this Agreement to GateHouse), and no consent of GateHouse shall be required
with respect to any amendment or waiver of this Agreement (other than this
Section 10.21) that is effected in accordance with this Agreement. The
liability of GateHouse under this Agreement by reason of this Section 10.21
is primary, and Sellers shall not be required to make any demand on Buyer for
performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement, nor to exhaust any
legal, contractual or equitable remedies against Buyer, prior to proceeding
against GateHouse.
