(a) As used herein, the term "Net Assets" means the total consolidated assets

Transferred Entities, each determined in accordance with GAAP and consistent
with past practices of the Transferred Entities, exercising the same
accounting policies, conventions, principles and methods used in the
preparation of the audited balance sheet of Seller as of December 29, 2012 and
the unaudited balance sheet of November 23, 2013. Set forth on Exhibit F
hereto is an illustration of the calculation of Net Assets as of December 29,
2012 and November 23, 2013. For the avoidance of doubt, Net Assets shall (i)
not include intercompany accounts or financial entries representing

Purchaser, prior to the Execution Date, shall not be effective to satisfy

Assets"). If Estimated Net Assets exceeds Target Net Assets, the Estimated Net
Assets Payment shall be added to the Closing Purchase Price. If the Estimated
Net Assets is less than Target Net Assets, the Closing Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the amount of the Estimated Net Assets Payment.

(c) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller (i) a balance sheet of the Business, which shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and consistent with past practices of the Transferred
Entities, as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) a
calculation of the Net Assets, as reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet, as
of the Effective Time (the "Final Net Assets Calculation"). Seller shall have
full access to the financial books and records pertaining to the Business to
confirm or audit the Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Net Assets
Calculation. If, within thirty (30) days after the date on which the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Final Net Assets Calculation are delivered by the
Purchaser to Seller, the Seller has not given written notice to Purchaser of
Seller's objection thereto, then the Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Net
Assets Calculation provided by the Purchaser will be final and binding on
Seller and Purchaser. If Seller disagrees with Purchaser's determination of
the Final Net Assets Calculation, the Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing
within thirty (30) days after Purchaser's delivery to Seller of the Closing
Balance Sheet and its determination of the Final Net Assets Calculation and
state the basis of the disagreement. If Seller and Purchaser fail to agree
within thirty (30) days after Seller's delivery of notice of disagreement on
the amount of the Final Net Assets Calculation, such disagreement shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.7(e), which
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for resolving disputes relating to the
determination of the Final Net Assets Calculation.

(d) Settlement of Net Assets.

(i) The Closing Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased (the Closing
Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to this Section 1.7(d) is referred to
herein as the "Final Purchase Price") based on the difference between the
actual Net Assets as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Net Assets") and the
Estimated Net Assets. If Closing Net Assets is greater than Estimated Net
Assets, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, within three (3) Business Days after the determination of
Closing Net Assets shall have become final and binding on the Parties, an
amount equal to the excess.

(ii) If Closing Net Assets is less than Estimated Net Assets, Purchaser and
Seller shall, within three (3) Business Days after the determination of
Closing Net Assets shall have become final and binding on the Parties, jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay from the Escrow Funds, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to Purchaser an amount equal to the deficiency.
If the deficiency is in excess of the Escrow Funds, then Seller shall also,
within three (3) Business Days after the determination of Closing Net Assets
shall have become final and binding on the Parties, pay an amount necessary to
satisfy the deficiency by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(e) Dispute of Adjustments. In the event that Seller and Purchaser are not
able to agree on the Final Net Assets Calculation within thirty (30) days
after Seller's delivery of notice of disagreement in accordance with Section
1.7(c) hereof, Seller and Purchaser shall each have the

right to require that such disputed determination be submitted to such
independent certified public accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") as the
Seller and Purchaser may then promptly mutually agree upon in writing for
computation or verification in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. The Accounting Firm shall review the matters in dispute and, acting
as arbitrators, shall promptly decide the proper amounts of such disputed
entries (which decision shall also include a final calculation of the Final
Net Assets Calculation). If the Parties cannot agree on an Accounting Firm,
then Purchaser will choose one Accounting Firm and Seller will choose one
Accounting Firm, and the two chosen Accounting Firms will choose a third
Accounting Firm. The third Accounting Firm will decide the matters in dispute.
The submission of the disputed matter to the Accounting Firm selected pursuant
to this Section 1.7(e) (the "Arbitrating Accounting Firm") shall be the
exclusive remedy for resolving disputes relative to the determination of the
Final Net Assets Calculation. Absent manifest error, the Arbitrating
Accounting Firm's determination shall be binding upon Seller and Purchaser.
The Arbitrating Accounting Firm's fees and expenses shall be borne equally by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand.

POST-CLOSING MATTERS

1472108.3/SPSA/65152/0245/022414

9.1 Misdirected Payments, Etc. Seller covenants and agrees to remit, with
reasonable promptness, to the Transferred Entities, any payments received by
Seller, which payments are on or in respect of accounts or notes receivable
owned by (or are otherwise payable to) the Transferred Entities or the
Business.

9.2 Employee Matters. Purchaser intends to continue the employment of
substantially all current employees of the Transferred Entities following the
Closing at rates of pay and conditions of employment similar to their current
arrangements. Except as specifically provided herein, nothing shall be deemed
to (i) affect or limit in any way the normal management prerogatives of
Purchaser after the Effective Time with respect to employees of the
Transferred Entities after Closing or (ii) create or grant to such employees
any third party beneficiary rights or claims of any kind or nature.

9.3 Tax Matters.

(a) Filing and Review of Tax Returns. Seller shall be responsible for
preparing and filing all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect
to the Transferred Entities on or prior to the Closing Date (determined taking
into account any extensions). Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing and
filing all other Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the
Transferred Entities. Any Tax Return relating to any Transferred Entity for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall, unless otherwise required by applicable
Legal Requirements or approved by the Parties in writing, be prepared in
accordance with past Tax accounting practices used with respect to the Tax
Returns in question. To the extent any items are not covered by past
practices, or to the extent such past practices are not permissible under
applicable Legal Requirements, the items may be reported in accordance with
any reasonable Tax accounting practices selected by the Party responsible for
preparing the Tax Returns. If requested by Seller, Purchaser shall make
available to Seller and their representatives for review and comment any Tax
Returns and related work papers prepared by Purchaser relating to the
Transferred Entities for any Straddle Period. Purchaser shall use its
reasonable efforts to make such Tax Return and work papers available for
review as required under this paragraph sufficiently in advance of the due
date for filing such Tax Returns to provide Seller with a meaningful
opportunity to analyze and comment on such Tax Returns and have such Tax
Returns modified before filing. Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any issues arising out of the review of such Tax Returns.
Neither of Seller nor Purchaser will, or will cause any Transferred Entity to,
file any amended return or otherwise modify any return filed, carryback claim,
or other adjustment request relating to any Transferred Entity for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period unless such action is required by applicable Legal
Requirements, or the Party proposing to file the return, claim, or adjustment
request has obtained the prior written consent of the other Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned.

(b) Allocation of Taxes for Straddle Periods. The portion of any Taxes based
on or measured by income or receipts of any Transferred Entity attributable to
the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined as though such portion of the Straddle Period constituted a taxable
period ending on the Closing Date. Any allocation of receipts, income, or
deductions required to determine the amount of any Taxes attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be prepared by
Purchaser in good faith and





MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS AND PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS PURCHASE AGREEMENT - PAGE 38



PHIL1 3252835v.11

1472108.3/SPSA/65152/0245/022414

* * *





shall be made by means of treating the Closing Date as the end of the relevant
taxable period (with the result that the amounts shall be calculated as if the
books of such Transferred Entity had been closed as of such date); provided,
however, that exemptions, allowances, or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after
the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period. With
respect to Taxes of any Transferred Entity for a Straddle Period (other than
taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of such Transferred Entity),
the amount of such Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

(c) Tax Benefits. If Purchaser or any Transferred Entity directly or
indirectly receive any refund of any Taxes paid with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, or otherwise receive any benefit or credit as a result of any
adjustment to Tax for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser shall cause the
refund or tax benefit amount to be paid to Seller as soon as practical after
receipt by Purchaser (except to the extent such refunds were taken into
account in computing the Net Assets). If Purchaser has an undisputed unpaid
claim pending against Seller, Purchaser may apply the tax benefit payment due
by Purchaser to Seller against the Purchaser's undisputed claim against
Seller.

(d) Inter-Period Adjustments. In calculating the amount of any Tax due from
Seller, or Tax benefit due to Seller, hereunder with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, proper accounting shall be made for any tax items arising in a
Post-Closing Tax Period. For example, if Seller is entitled to a Tax benefit
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period resulting from increased depreciation
deductions claimed in the Pre-Closing Tax Period, any corresponding increase
in Taxes due for any Post-Closing Tax Period as a result of lower depreciable
basis in the Post-Closing Tax Period shall likewise be for Seller's account.
Conversely, if any Tax assessment for any Pre-Closing Tax Period produces a
Tax benefit for any Post-Closing Tax Period, the Tax Benefit for the Post-
Closing Tax Period shall be for Purchaser's account. A refund of Taxes for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period attributable to a carryback of a net operating loss
arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for Purchaser's account.

(e) Termination of Tax Allocation or Sharing Agreements. Any tax sharing or
allocation agreement between any Transferred Entity and any other Person shall
be terminated as of the Closing Date and will have no further effect for any
taxable year (whether the current year, a future year or a past year).

(f) Disregarded Entities. The parties acknowledge that there will not be any
tax returns for any Straddle Period for entities that are disregarded entities
for United States federal Tax purposes.

9.4 Seller Name Change. Within five (5) days after the Closing Date, Seller
shall change its limited partnership name to a name that is not similar to the
name "Specialized Industries" and does not contain the word "Specialized."
Seller agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, neither

Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall use the word "Specialized" in or for
its or their business operations in any manner whatsoever.

from a breach of any of the Fundamental Reps) unless the aggregate amount of
all Damages for which Purchaser is otherwise entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement exceeds $750,000 (the "Deductible") and, in the
event that Damages exceed the Deductible, only to the extent of such excess.

(r) Payments by an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages shall be
limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting
therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment received or reasonably expected to be received by the
Indemnified Party in respect of any such claim.

(s) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages
(other than such damages

paid to a third party in connection with a claim by such third party that is
otherwise covered by indemnification under this Agreement), including loss of
future revenue or income, loss of business reputation or opportunity relating
to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, or diminution of value or
any damages based on any type of multiple.

10.5 Method of Asserting Claims; Defense of Claims. In connection with any
claim giving rise to indemnity under this Agreement resulting from or arising
out of any claim or legal proceeding by a Person who is not a party to this
Agreement (each, a "Third Party Claim") the following terms and conditions
shall apply:

(j) Notice. The indemnified party ("Indemnified Party") shall promptly give
written notice to the indemnifying party ("Indemnifying Party") of any Third
Party Claim which might give rise to any Damages to the Indemnified Party,
stating the nature and basis of such Third Party Claim, and, when known, the
amount thereof and the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party
in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any Liability hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced by the delay. Such notice shall be
accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with respect to such Third
Party Claim, including any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have
been served, any written demand or any other document or instrument.

(k) Control of Defense of Third Party Claims. Except as otherwise agreed among
the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have
control over the defense of all Third Party Claims, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall keep
the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the status of the defense of
such Third Party Claims and use such counsel that is reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any
Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's written consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to pay or settle any such Third Party Claim,
provided that in such event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by
the Indemnifying Party for such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, enter into any settlement with respect to
any Third Party Claim.

(l) Non-Third Party Claims.

(i) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice to the Indemnifying Party.
(The term "Indemnity Notice" means written notification of a claim for
indemnity under Article 10 (which claim does not involve a Third Party Claim)
by an Indemnified Party to an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section
10.5, specifying the nature of and specific basis for such claim and the
amount or the estimated amount of such claim.) The failure by any Indemnified
Party to give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such party's rights
hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it
has been prejudiced thereby.

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) calendar days following its receipt of an Indemnity Notice that
the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party
hereunder, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party will be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such
claim, as provided above, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
agree to proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and
if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute will be resolved by
adjudication by a court or similar tribunal.

(m) Purchaser may give notice under the Escrow Agreement of a claim in any
amount to which it believes in good faith it may be entitled under this
Article 10 to the extent any portion of the Escrow Funds remains subject
thereto. If any portion of the Escrow Funds remains subject to the Escrow
Agreement, any liability of the Seller for indemnification hereunder shall
first be satisfied out of the Escrow Funds to the extent that sufficient funds
are available thereunder.

(n) Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 10
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for tax
purposes.

ARTICLE 11

11.11 Expenses and Attorneys' Fees. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each Party shall bear and pay its own costs and expenses relating
to the preparation of this Agreement and to the transactions contemplated by,
or the performance of or compliance with any condition or covenant set forth
in, this Agreement, including without limitation, the disbursements and fees
of their respective attorneys, accountants, advisors, agents and other
representatives, incidental to the preparation and carrying out of this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated. Purchaser will pay all costs, fees and expenses associated with,
or incurred with a view toward complying with, Purchaser's obligations as a
publicly traded company, including without limitation, all costs, fees and
expenses relating to current and periodic reporting, compliance with laws and
regulations applicable to public companies and reviewing, conforming and/or
preparing financial statements and other information relating to the
Transferred Entities. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, will each pay one-half of (a) the HSR Act filing fee and (b) the fees

prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover its court costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees.

11.13 No Waiver. Any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement may be
waived at any time by the Party which is entitled to the benefit thereof but
only by a written notice signed by the Party expressly waiving such term,
covenant or condition. The subsequent acceptance of performance hereunder by a
Party shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding breach by any other
Party of any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement, other than the
failure of such other Party to perform the particular duties so accepted,
regardless of the accepting Party's knowledge of such preceding breach at the
time of acceptance of such performance. The waiver of any term, covenant or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any other term, covenant or
condition of this Agreement.

11.14 Severability. If any term, provision, condition or covenant of this
Agreement or the application thereof to any Party or circumstance shall be
held to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent in any jurisdiction, then
the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such term, provision,
condition or covenant in any other jurisdiction or to persons or circumstances
other than those as to whom or which it is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term, provision,
condition and covenant of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

11.15 Construction. No Party, or its respective counsel, shall be deemed the
drafter of this Agreement for purposes of construing the provisions of this
Agreement, and all language in all parts of this Agreement shall be construed
in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any Party.

unconditionally guarantees, on a joint and several basis, the payment in full
when due of all amounts required to be paid by Purchaser under this Agreement.
