ARTICLE II

  

  

PURCHASE AND SALE

  

  

2.1 Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, in
exchange for the Partnership Interests, Buyer shall pay to Sellers the
aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") of (i) Four Hundred Seventy-
Five Million Dollars ($475,000,000) (the "Cash Portion of the Purchase Price")
minus (ii) the Purchase Price Deductions. The Purchase Price shall be subject
to adjustment at and after the Closing in accordance with Section 2.4 and
Section 2.5. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Sellers the Purchase Price
increased or decreased for any Estimated Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section
2.4(f) and an amount reflecting the Acquired Companies' cash, in the
aggregate, on the Closing Date as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet
of Resource Partners in cash (the "Cash" and the Purchase Price, as increased
or decreased by the Estimated Adjustment Amount and the Cash, is referred to
as the "Closing Cash Consideration"). The Closing Cash Consideration shall be
payable at the Closing as follows:

  

  

(i) Buyer shall deliver the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
terms and conditions of Section 2.7; and

  

  

(ii) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the balance of the Closing Cash Consideration
(being the Closing Cash Consideration less the Escrow Amount) by wire transfer
of immediately available United States funds, in the percentage per Seller as
set forth on Schedule 2.1(a)(ii), to accounts designated by Agent for the
benefit of Sellers in written instructions given to Buyer at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing. Prior to the payment to Sellers of the
balance of the Closing Cash Consideration, such Closing Cash Consideration
will additionally be reduced by the amounts estimated by Resource Partners,
IRP GP and Agent necessary to pay fees and expenses of Sellers including those
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amounts Agent shall certify in writing to Buyer at least one (1) Business Day
prior to the Closing, and Buyer shall pay such amounts by wire transfer of
immediately available United States funds to accounts designated by Agent for
the benefit of Sellers.

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and in any case prior to the Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall use
reasonable efforts to agree upon the allocation of the Purchase Price (and all
other capitalizable costs) among the assets of the Acquired Companies, which
the parties shall adjust to reflect any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
in accordance with Section 2.5(f). Any such allocation shall be intended to
comply with the allocation method required by Section 1060 of the Code. The
parties shall cooperate in complying with all requirements of Section 1060 of
the Code and the regulations thereunder, and the allocation shall be adjusted
only if and to the extent necessary to comply with such requirements. Buyer
and Sellers agree that they will not take nor will they permit any of their
Affiliates or Related Persons to take, for income Tax purposes, any position
inconsistent with any such agreed-upon allocation, if any; provided, however,
that (a) Buyer's total cost for the assets of each Acquired Company may differ
from the total amount allocated hereunder to reflect Buyer's transaction costs
other than the Purchase Price, and (b) the amount realized by Sellers may
differ from the total amount allocated hereunder to reflect Sellers'
transaction costs that reduce the amount realized for income tax purposes.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Under no circumstance shall Buyer be liable to any Seller or other Person for
any action, omission or delay of the Agent or any other recipient in dealing
with or distributing any payment or any portion of the Purchase Price or of
any other payment or performance made by or on behalf of Buyer in accordance
herewith or any other Transaction Document, to or as prescribed by the Agent.
Nothing contained in Section 2.1(a)(ii) providing for allocation of the
Purchase Price hereunder in accordance with Schedule 2.1(a)(ii) shall be
deemed to limit the foregoing.

Article IX, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Articles VII and VIII, the closing (the "Closing") of the Contemplated
Transactions shall take place at the offices of Jackson Kelly PLLC, 1600
Laidley Tower, Charleston, West Virginia 25301, or at such other place as may

Business Day after all of such conditions have been satisfied or waived by the

efforts to resolve any such objection. If a written resolution is not obtained
within thirty (30) days after the Agent has received the Buyer Objection
Notice, the issue(s) in dispute will be submitted to the Auditor for
resolution, which resolution will be limited to determining Closing Date Net
Working Capital, Unpaid Indebtedness and Unpaid Transaction Expenses, and any
other accounting matters specifically referred to the Auditor by the mutual
agreement of the Agent and Buyer. The determination of the Auditor shall be
set forth in a written notice delivered, as promptly as practicable after the

by the Auditor and will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. Buyer
and Sellers shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of the fees and expenses of
the Auditor for such determination. Buyer and Agent will use all reasonable
efforts to cause the Auditor to render its decision as promptly as
practicable, including without limitation by promptly complying with all
reasonable requests by the Auditor for information, books, records and similar

Capital exceeds the Reference Net Working Capital, or minus the amount, if

rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" as set forth from time to time in The
Wall Street Journal "Money Rates" column. Buyer and Sellers agree that, unless
otherwise required by Law, any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.5
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes.

  

  

2.6 Payment of the Indebtedness. Prior to or at the Closing, Sellers shall pay
the Indebtedness set forth on Schedule 2.6 in full and shall deliver to Buyer
satisfactory evidence that they have done so. Prior to the Closing, Sellers

Indebtedness listed on Schedule 2.6 to enter into an agreement to release or
authorize the release of any Encumbrances on any of the Acquired Companies'
assets securing such Indebtedness upon payment in full of such Indebtedness

Escrow Amount, the "Escrow Amount") (the "Escrow Fund") in cash payable by
wire transfer of immediately available United States funds for deposit in an
Escrow Account in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement to be entered into by and among Buyer, Agent, on behalf of Sellers,
and the Escrow Agent in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Escrow
Agreement"). The Escrow Fund shall be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

2.8 Escrow Release.

  

  

(a) General. Subject to the terms and provisions of this Section 2.8 and the
Escrow Agreement, fourteen (14) months following the Closing (the "Escrow
Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Sellers a portion of the
Escrow Fund in an amount equal to the General Escrow Amount (as reduced by any
amounts previously disbursed to Sellers or Buyer pursuant to Section 2.8(b),
Section 2.8(c)(iii), Section 10.1 and the Escrow Agreement) in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. In the event, however, that Agent has
received, on or before the Escrow Release Date, a notice (a "Claim Notice")
submitted in good faith by Buyer that the Escrow Agent may be required to
disburse all or a portion of the Escrow Amount (such claimed amount, the
"Claim Amount") to Buyer pursuant to Section 10.1(a) or Sections 2.7 or 2.8,
then the portion of the Escrow Amount subject to such Claim Notice shall
continue to be held by the Escrow Agent until the Claim Amount with respect
thereto has been resolved. As soon as any dispute with respect to any such
Claim Amount has been resolved in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be instructed to disburse such portion of
the General Escrow Amount in the Escrow Fund, if any, that is required to be
disbursed to Buyer pursuant to Section 10.1(a) or Sections 2.7 or 2.8 in
connection with such Claim Amount, and the Escrow Agent shall disburse the
entire remaining portion of the General Escrow Amount, if any, to Sellers.

  

  

(b) Reserve Claims.

  

  

(i) Since the issuance of the Marshall Miller Report, the Acquired Companies
have continued and will continue to prove metallurgical reserves not
classified in the Marshall Miller Report as proven metallurgical reserves
("Additional Reserves") through drilling and/or adding additional acreage.

  

  

(ii) Up to $5,000,000 of the amounts remaining in the General Escrow Amount
will be released to Buyer if at least 10 Million tons of Additional Reserves
are not proven by the Escrow Release Date. The portion of such $5,000,000
(less drilling expenses paid pursuant to Section 2.8(b)(iv)) to be released to
Buyer shall be equal to the ratio of (A) 10 Million minus the number of tons
of Additional Reserves proven prior to the Escrow Release Date, to (B) 10
Million tons.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(iii) Coal will be classified as "metallurgical" and as "reserves" under
customary coal industry standards or otherwise to the reasonable satisfaction
of Buyer, provided that the resulting washed quality of coal must meet such
standards for metallurgical coal. Any dispute between the parties as to
whether mineral interests constitute "reserves" or "metallurgical reserves" or
"Additional Reserves" shall be finally settled by Marshall Miller. These
Additional Reserves are to be established by drilling reserves covered by
existing leases of the Acquired Companies or under new leases, agreements or
other arrangements that are in active negotiation by the Acquired Companies as
of the date of this Agreement, rather than under new leases not being pursued
as of the date of this Agreement. In the event that Agent has received, on or
before the Escrow Release Date, a notice submitted in good faith by Sellers
that there is a dispute regarding Additional Reserves (a "Reserve Dispute"),
then the portion of the General Escrow Amount subject to such Reserve Dispute
shall continue to be held by the Escrow Agent until the Reserve Dispute has
been resolved.

  

  

(iv) Up to $1,000,000 of the General Escrow Amount shall also be available to
fund drilling and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that are incurred by
the Acquired Companies in connection with any efforts to prove such Additional
Reserves. Such funds shall be released to Buyer from the General Escrow Amount
promptly upon its delivery to Escrow Agent of reasonable documentation that
such expenses have been incurred for such purpose. In no event shall the
General Escrow Amount be paid for expenses incurred for drilling after the
date that 10 Million tons of Additional Reserves are proven. Any dispute
between the parties as to whether any expenditures qualify for reimbursement
to Buyer or the Acquired Companies pursuant to this Section 2.8(b)(iv) shall
be finally settled by Marshall Miller.

  

  

(v) Both parties will use their best efforts to cause such Additional Reserves
to be proven by the Acquired Companies, including instituting an active
drilling program to prove such Additional Reserves; provided that such efforts
by Buyer shall not include making any cash payments not reimbursed out of the
General Escrow Amount or entering into any agreement or arrangement that Buyer
concludes in good faith is not in the best interests of the Acquired Companies
to make or enter into. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Agent with
regular updates of the status of its drilling program with respect to the
Additional Reserves, including providing any data reasonably requested by
Agent.

  

  

(c) Mine 8 Related Claims.

  

  

(i) All fines and legal fees of Buyer and/or the Acquired Companies related to
MSHA or WVOMHandS violations that took place at the Acquired Companies'
Rockhouse Mine 8 ("Mine 8") prior to Closing, whether disclosed to Buyer or
not ("Prior Violations"), will be paid from the Special Escrow Amount (first
dollar out not subject to any deductible).

  

  

(ii) All claims for damages suffered by Buyer and/or the Acquired Companies
that are related to the Prior Violations also will be paid from the Special
Escrow Amount (first dollar out not subject to any deductible). Damages for
these purposes shall include, but not be limited to, $20,000 per day that Mine
8 is designated by MSHA to be on a Potential Pattern of Violation (PPOV) list.
Any other damages that can be proven by Buyer shall be in addition to the per
diem amount.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(iii) If, prior to the Escrow Release Date , Mine 8 is designated on a Pattern
of Violation (POV) list by MSHA that is attributable to the Prior Violations,
then all claims for damages suffered by Buyer and/or the Acquired Companies
that are related to the Prior Violations may at Buyer's option be paid out of
the General Escrow Amount before proceeding against the Special Escrow Amount.
Damages for these purposes shall include, but not be limited to, $20,000 per
day that Mine 8 is designated by MSHA to be on a POV list. Any other damages
that can be proven by Buyer shall be in addition to this per diem amount.

  

  

(iv) In the event of a dispute regarding claims by Buyer for damages under
this Section 2.8(c), the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
resolve any such disputes. If a written resolution is not obtained within
thirty (30) days after either party provides written notice of a dispute, the
issue(s) in dispute will be submitted to Norwest Corporation for resolution,
which resolution shall be limited to determining such issue(s) in dispute;
provided that the $20,000 per day liquidated damages amount shall not be
subject to dispute or arbitration.. The determination of Norwest Corporation
shall be set forth in a written notice delivered, as promptly as practicable
after the issue(s) in dispute have been submitted to Norwest Corporation, to
Buyer and Agent by Norwest Corporation and will be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties. The losing party will pay all fees and expenses of
such arbitration including legal fees for the prevailing party. Buyer and
Agent will use reasonable best efforts to cause Norwest Corporation to render
its decision as promptly as practicable, including without limitation by
promptly complying with all reasonable requests by Norwest Corporation for
information, books, records and similar items.

  

  

(v) The Special Escrow Amount shall remain in place and not be released to
Agent until such time as all legal proceedings and fines relating to the Prior
Violations have been finally resolved (such date being referred to as the
"Final Release Date"). Until the Final release Date, claims may continue to be
made against the Special Escrow Amount as provided hereunder. Upon the Final
Release Date, the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Sellers any remaining portion
of the Special Escrow Amount.

  

  

(vi) Buyer shall provide and shall cause its outside counsel to the Acquired
Companies to provide prompt and regular updates to Agent regarding material
developments in connection with the Prior Violations, including the status of
any negotiations and proceedings.

Each of the Acquired Companies is duly organized and validly existing under
the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Acquired Companies
has the requisite organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate
its assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted and is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in the
jurisdictions in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification or license, except where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed (a) would not reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to prevent any of the Acquired Companies from
consummating the Contemplated Transactions or (b) would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Resource Partners has delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of the
Organizational Documents of each of the Acquired Companies.

  

  

3.2 Authorization; Enforceability.

  

Resource Partners has the requisite organizational power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by Resource Partners,
and the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, has been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Resource Partners, and, upon
such authorization, no other proceedings or actions are necessary to authorize
and consummate this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the
Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement has been, and upon the Closing Date
the other Transaction Documents will be, duly executed and delivered by
Resource Partners, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
Buyer, constitute the valid and binding agreements of Resource Partners and
are enforceable against Resource Partners in accordance with their terms,
except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

  

  

3.3 Interests. The authorized, issued and outstanding Membership Interests of
the Acquired Companies are set forth on Schedule 3.3, together with the
identity of the members of each of the Acquired Companies, as applicable. On
the Closing Date, Resource Partners will be the record and beneficial owner
and holder of the Membership Interests, in each case free and clear of all
Encumbrances. All of the outstanding equity securities of each Acquired
Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. Other than the Organizational Documents, there are no contracts
relating to the issuance, sale, or transfer of any equity securities or other
securities of any Acquired Company. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3, there
are no outstanding warrants, options, agreements, convertible or exchangeable
securities or other commitments pursuant to which any Acquired Company is or
may become obligated to issue or sell any shares of equity securities or other
securities, and there are no equity securities of any Acquired Company
reserved for issuance for any purpose.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

   
 

3.4 Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) IRP GP has delivered to Buyer: (i) the financial statements of Resource
Partners as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, audited by
PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP, which include true and correct information
associated with the respective balance sheets and statements of operations and
cash flows of the Acquired Companies (the "Audited Financials"), and (ii) if
available, on the date even herewith, the unaudited financial statements for
the month ended January 31, 2011, including the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet as of January 31, 2011 (the "Latest Balance Sheet"), and the related
statements of operations and cash flows for the period then ended, which
includes the respective balance sheets and statements of operations and cash
flows of the Acquired Companies (the "Unaudited Financials", and such Audited
Financials and Unaudited Financials, collectively "Financial Statements"). The
Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Acquired Companies and the results of their
operations and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods indicated in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied; provided, however, that the
Unaudited Financials are prepared and derived from the consolidated financial
statements of Resources Partners and (i) lack footnotes and other presentation
items that may apply for a stand-alone business and (ii) are subject to
certain normal yearend adjustments.

  

  

(b) To the Knowledge of IRP GP and Resource Partners, there (i) are no
significant deficiencies or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal controls which are reasonably likely to adverse affect in any
material respect the ability of the Acquired Companies considered as a whole
to record, process, summarize and report financial data, (ii) is no fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in any Acquired Company's internal controls, (iii) Resource
Partners' transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
specific authorization; (iv) Resource Partners' transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; and (v) the amount recorded
for assets on the respective books and records of Resource Partners is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals in connection with
the preparation of the annual audits of Resource Partners' consolidated
financial statements and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.

  

  

(c) Since January 1, 2008, none of the Acquired Companies nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of IRP GP and Resource Partners,
any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of any
Acquired Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries has received or
otherwise had or obtained Knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, or methodologies of any Acquired Company or
its respective Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion, or claim that any
Acquired Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices.

  

  

3.5 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as reflected in the Latest
Balance Sheet or on Schedule 3.5, no Acquired Company has any Liability of any
nature whatsoever (direct or indirect, matured or unmatured, absolute,
accrued, or contingent), except as would not be material to any of the
Acquired Companies, that would be required by GAAP to be included in the
Latest Balance Sheet or reflected in footnotes to a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP as consistently applied or that would prevent Sellers or
any of the Acquired Companies from consummating the Contemplated Transactions.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

   
 

3.6 No Conflicts or Approvals. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.6 or Schedule
3.7, the execution, delivery and performance by Sellers of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents and the consummation by Sellers of the
Contemplated Transactions does not and will not (a) violate, conflict with or
result in a breach by Sellers or any of the Acquired Companies of their
respective Organizational Documents, (b) require any Consent or other action
by any Person, cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or
other change of any right or obligation or violate, conflict with or result in
a material breach of, or constitute a default by Sellers or any of the
Acquired Companies (with or without notice or lapse of time) under any
Material Contract, Permit or Equipment Lease to which any of the Acquired
Companies or any of the Acquired Companies' properties or assets may be bound,
(c) require any Consent or other action by any Person, cause or permit the
termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or violate, conflict with or result in a material breach of, or
constitute a default by Sellers or any of the Acquired Companies (with or
without notice or lapse of time) under any Real Property Lease requiring
lessor's consent for change of control of Resource Partners to which any of
the Acquired Companies or any Acquired Companies' properties or assets may be
bound, (d) assuming compliance with applicable requirements under the HSR Act,
violate, conflict with, or result in a material breach of any Governmental
Order or Law applicable to Sellers or any of the Acquired Companies or any of
their respective properties or assets or (e) result in the creation of any
Encumbrance, other than Permitted Encumbrances, upon any of the properties or
assets of any of the Acquired Companies.

  

  

3.7 Governmental Authorization. Assuming compliance with applicable
requirements under the HSR Act, the execution, delivery and performance by
Sellers and each of the Acquired Companies of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions,
except for the actions and filings listed on Schedule 3.7, the filings
required for the transfer of control of the Permits set forth on Schedule
3.8(b) (i) require no action by, or in respect of, any Governmental Authority
or any Governmental Approval, and any such action or filing as to which the
failure to make or obtain would not be material to any of the Acquired
Companies or prevent Sellers or any of the Acquired Companies from
consummating the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) will not give any
Governmental Authority the right to challenge any portion of the Contemplated
Transactions or exercise any remedy or obtain any relief under any Law to
which Sellers or any Acquired Company is subject, and (iii) will not
contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of any of the terms or
requirements of, or give any Governmental Authority the right to revoke,
withdraw, suspend, cancel, not renew, terminate or materially modify, any
Permit of an Acquired Company.

  

  

3.8 Compliance; Permits; Seller Bonds.

  

  

(a) Each of the Acquired Companies has conducted its respective business and
developed and operated its assets in compliance in all material respects with
all Permits, except as set forth on Schedule 3.8(a).

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

(b) Each Acquired Company possesses all material Permits necessary to own,
lease and operate its assets and lawfully conduct its business consistent in
all material respects with past practices. Schedule 3.8(b) contains an
accurate and complete list and summary description of all such Permits, in
each case setting forth the name of the grantor, the name of the grantee, and
the expiration and renewal date of, and the amount of bonding obligation with
respect to each Permit. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8(b), each such
Permit has been validly issued and is in full force and effect and is final
and, to the Knowledge of IRP GP and Resource Partners, no event has occurred
that constitutes or, with the giving of notice, the passage of time, or both,
would constitute a material default by any Acquired Company or any other
Person under any such Permit. All fees and other payments due and owing in
connection with such Permits have been paid in full and in a timely manner so
as to prevent any lapse, revocation or material breach thereof.

  

  

(c) There are no applications for permits to be issued by Governmental
Authorities to any Acquired Company other than those set forth on Schedule

such application as set forth on Schedule 3.8(c). Each Application has been

funds, bid bonds, performance bonds, reclamation bonds and surety bonds (and

Schedule 3.8(d): (i) each of the Acquired Companies is and has been in
compliance in all material respects with all Seller Bonds applicable to it;
and (ii) the operation of each Company's coal mining and processing operations
and the state of reclamation with respect to Seller Bonds are "current" or in
"deferred status" regarding reclamation obligations and otherwise are and have
been in compliance in all material respects with all applicable mining,
reclamation and other analogous Laws, except where noncompliance would not
interfere in any material respect with the ability of any Acquired Company to
continue to operate its assets and conduct its business as currently conducted
and would not prevent Sellers or any Acquired Company from consummating the
Contemplated Transactions.

  

  

(e) Each Acquired Company is, and at all times has been since June 12, 2007,
in material compliance with all Laws that are or were applicable to it or to
the use or operation of its assets, including Occupational Health and Safety
Laws.

  

  

(f) To the Knowledge of IRP GP and Resource Partners, no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time) (i) may
constitute or result in a material violation by any Acquired Company of any
Law applicable to it or its business or assets, (ii) constitute or result
directly or indirectly in a violation of or a failure to comply with any
material term or requirement of, or result directly or indirectly in the
revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, non-renewal, termination of
or modification to, or result in the imposition of any condition on, any
Permit listed or required to be listed on Schedule 3.8(b), or (iii) may give
rise to any obligation on the part of any Acquired Company to undertake, or to
bear all or any portion of the cost of, any remedial action of a material
nature.

alleged, possible or potential violation of, or failure to comply in any
material respect with, any Law or failure to comply with any term or
requirement of any Permit, (ii) any actual, proposed, possible, or potential

or modification to any Permit, or (iii) any actual, alleged, possible, or
potential obligation on the part of an Acquired Company to undertake or to

$100,000.

  

  

(i) The execution, delivery and performance by the Sellers of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the Contemplated

result in any termination, modification or non-renewals thereof.

6.6 Financing.

  

  

(a) Buyer has received, accepted and agreed to a commitment letter, dated
March 6, 2011 (the "Commitment Letter") from the lenders party thereto
(collectively, the "Lenders") relating to the commitment of the Lenders to
provide the debt financing required to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions. The debt financing required to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, whether obtained pursuant to the arrangements contemplated by
the Commitment Letter or through substitute permanent financing arrangements
which may involve public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, is
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Financing". A complete and
correct copy of the executed Commitment Letter has been provided to Agent.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including (i) taking actions to
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and (ii) using its reasonable
best efforts to (A) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on
the terms and conditions contained therein or on other terms no more adverse
to Buyer in any material respect, (B) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to it in such definitive agreements and (C) consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing but in no event later than June 1, 2011.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(c) Buyer may terminate and replace the Commitment Letter with a New
Commitment Letter or may amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, so long as (i) the
addition of such lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and (ii) the Arranger
(as defined in the Commitment Letter) shall remain obligated and committed to
fund its financing commitments under the Commitment Letter (as in effect prior
to any such amendment) on the terms and conditions of, and subject to the
assignment provisions set forth in, the Commitment Letter (as in effect prior
to any such amendment). Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification of the Commitment Letter in accordance with this Section 6.6(c),
the term "Commitment Letter" shall mean the Commitment Letter as so amended,
supplemented or modified or any New Commitment Letter in replacement of the
Commitment Letter, as the case may be, and, in the event that Buyer obtains
Alternative Financing in accordance with Section 6.6(d), the term "Commitment
Letter" shall mean the commitment letter (as amended, replaced, supplemented
or modified in accordance with this Section 6.6(c)) related to the Alternative
Financing. The term "New Commitment Letter" shall mean the instrument
replacing the existing Commitment Letter that (A) is on terms not materially
less beneficial to Buyer than those set forth in the Commitment Letter; (B)
does not involve any material conditions precedent to funding the Financing
that are not contained in the Commitment Letter; and (C) would not reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions.

  

  

(d) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter (as such terms may be
modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms of, and within the limits
of, the "flex" provisions contained in the Commitment Letter or accompanying
fee letter) for any reason, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable but no later than the Drop Dead Date,
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions and that would not (i) involve any material
conditions to funding the Financing that are not contained in the Commitment
Letter; (ii) reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions; and (iii) include terms that
would be materially adverse when compared to the terms of the Commitment
Letter (an alternative financing meeting the foregoing requirements shall be
an "Alternative Financing"). In the event that Alternative Financing shall be
obtained pursuant to this Section 6.6(d), Buyer shall comply with the
covenants in Section 6.6(e) with respect to such Alternative Financing.

  

  

(e) Buyer shall give Sellers prompt written notice of any material breach by
any party of the Commitment Letter (or commitments for any Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with this Section 6.6(e)) of which Buyer
becomes aware, any termination of the Commitment Letter (or commitments for
any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this Section 6.6(e)) or
any condition precedent of the Financing (or any Alternative Financing
obtained in accordance with this Section 6.6(e)) which Buyer expects will not
be satisfied at the Closing, as applicable.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(f) At Buyer's request, Sellers shall cause the Acquired Companies, and its or
their representatives, to use their reasonable best efforts to (x) cooperate
with Buyer to complete the Financing to the extent that information relating
to, or the participation by members of management of, the Acquired Companies
is reasonably necessary in connection therewith; and (y) provide all
information and assistance that is customarily provided in financings
comparable to the proposed Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Sellers shall cause the Acquired Companies to:

time to time, (1) all Financial Statements, (2) all other financial statements
required by the Commitment Letter (or commitments for any Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with Section 6.6(e)) with respect to the
Acquired Companies within the time periods specified therein, including
information reasonably requested by Buyer to assist in the preparation of pro
forma financial statements and the projected consolidated financial statements
of Buyer and (3) all financial statements, business and other financial data,
audit reports and other information regarding the Acquired Companies of the
type that would be required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Securities Act for a registered public offering of debt or equity
securities of Buyer (to the extent such information in clauses (2) or (3)
currently exists and, in the event such information does not exist, Sellers
will assist in obtaining such information at Buyer's expense);

  

  

(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to Buyer, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, other information with respect to the Acquired
Companies reasonably requested by Buyer in writing (1) so that Buyer may

in private placements under Rule 144A under the Securities Act;

  

  

(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to Buyer, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, information relating to the Acquired Companies
reasonably requested by Buyer in writing that is customarily used in the
preparation of customary offering or information documents or rating agency,
lender presentations or road shows relating to the Financing;

  

  

(iv) upon reasonable advance notice and at Buyer's expense, participate in
investor presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and rating agency
presentations in connection with the Financing, including participation by
senior management of the Acquired Companies with appropriate seniority and
expertise;

  

  

(v) cooperate reasonably with Buyer's Financing sources' due diligence, to the
extent customary and reasonable and at Buyer's expense;

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(vi) assist at Buyer's expense with the preparation, including participating
in drafting sessions, of any confidential information memorandum, offering

any confidential information memorandum for use by "public-side" lenders) or
rating agency presentation used by Buyer in connection with the Financing;

  

  

(vii) request required consents of accountants for use of their reports in any
materials relating to the Financing where the inclusion of such reports is

(viii) use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate pledging collateral of
the Acquired Companies in connection with any debt portion of the Financing,
including the execution and delivery of customary pledge and security

Closing);

  

  

(ix) provide authorization letters to the Financing sources authorizing the
distribution of the Acquired Companies' information to prospective lenders;

  

  

(x) use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer and the Financing

Acquired Companies or the Sellers or the reputation or goodwill of the
Acquired Companies or the Sellers.

each will cause each of its respective Related Persons to, from time to time,

in this Agreement and render effective the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions.

51

shall pay to the extent known and quantifiable (i) any and all performance
bonuses earned by any Company Employee through the Closing Date and not
reflected in Current Liabilities ("Bonuses"); (ii) any and all "change of
control" or similar payments to which any Company Employee is entitled as a
result of the Contemplated Transactions (but only to the extent such right is

Purchase Price Deductions pursuant to Section 6.8(a) or not paid by Sellers
pursuant to Section 6.8(b).

  

  

6.9 Guarantees; Seller Bonds.

  

  

(a) Sellers' Guarantees. Prior to and after the Closing, Buyer shall cooperate
with Sellers and their Affiliates and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, which shall include preparation and submission of documents,
provision of information and response to requests, to cause Buyer and/or one
or more Affiliates of Buyer to be substituted in all respects for Sellers or
any Affiliate of Sellers, in respect of all Liabilities under the Seller
Guarantees, and to cause Sellers and all Affiliates of Sellers to be fully
released and discharged with respect thereto, in each case, as of the Closing
Date; provided that, Buyer's commercially reasonable efforts shall not include
making any cash payments to any party from which a release is sought or
modifying or amending any agreement with any party from which a release is
sought in a manner that is adverse to the Acquired Companies or Buyer. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to such Seller
Guarantees that are the result of Sellers being an indemnitor under any of
Seller Bonds, Buyer may post a replacement surety bond for the bond of the
Company in the manner set forth in Section 6.9(b) in lieu of being substituted
for Sellers. With respect to any Seller Guarantees which are not fully
released and discharged prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to replace such Seller Guarantees and/or to
cause Sellers and all Affiliates of Sellers to be fully released and
discharged therefrom effective as of the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Bonds. With respect to the Seller Bonds, Buyer shall post, within five (5)
Business Days following the Closing Date, a replacement surety bond for the
benefit of the beneficiaries thereof in form and substance and issued by a
surety company that is satisfactory to such beneficiaries. Each such
replacement surety bond so provided by the Buyer shall provide on its face
that it "supersedes and replaces" the applicable Seller Bond as of the Closing
Date. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to Sellers, such other documents as may reasonably be requested by
Sellers in order to permit Sellers to effect the full release and discharge of
Sellers and all Affiliates of Sellers as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall
reimburse Sellers on a monthly basis for all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by Sellers or the Affiliates of Sellers with respect to all such
bonds that remain outstanding following the Closing Date to the extent such
costs and expenses accrue on or after the Closing Date.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

(c) Indemnification After Closing. Buyer shall indemnify and hold Sellers and
all Affiliates of Sellers harmless from and against, and pay and reimburse
Sellers and all Affiliates of Sellers for, any and all Losses that they may
incur arising or relating to the Seller Guarantees or Seller Bonds for events
occurring on or after the Closing Date. Any payment required to be made by
Buyer under this Section shall be made within ten (10) Business Days after
Buyer's receipt of written notice from Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers
describing in reasonable detail the amount owing hereunder.

  

  

(d) Refund of Premiums. All funds in respect of premiums that are refunded in
respect of Seller Guarantees or Seller Bonds on account of the replacement
thereof by Buyer pursuant to this Section shall be for the account of Sellers
and their Affiliates. Buyer shall pay over or cause the Acquired Companies to
pay over to Sellers any such refunds received by any Acquired Company after
the Closing promptly upon receipt of such refunds.

  

  

(e) Required Efforts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any
party hereto be required to or otherwise file any lawsuit in order to cause
the replacement and/or release and discharge of any Seller Guaranty or Seller
Bond. After the Closing, Buyer will not, and will not permit any Acquired
Company to, renew, extend, amend or supplement any loan, contract, lease or
other obligation underlying any guarantee with respect to which Sellers and
their Affiliates are not fully released and discharged as of the Closing Date
in any manner that would extend or increase the Liability of Sellers or any
Affiliate of Sellers without providing Sellers with evidence satisfactory to
Sellers that Sellers and their Affiliates have been fully released and
discharged.

  

  

(f) Approval of Replacement Bonds. So long as Buyer provides adequate credit
support for the replacement of each Seller Bond pursuant to this Section 6.9
on or before the Closing Date, any delay in the release of a Seller Bond or a
bond being replaced at the discretion of Buyer in lieu of replacing Sellers as
an indemnitor for a Seller Bond shall not constitute a breach of the covenant
of Buyer to post such replacement surety bond by the Closing Date.

  

  

6.10 Permits.

  

  

(a) Pending Transfers; Documents. Within five (5) Business Days following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall submit (i) all filings necessary to cause the
applicable Governmental Authorities to transfer to Buyer the Permits (the
"Transfer Applications"); and (ii) any and all replacement bonds or other
financial security, if applicable, required to complete the transfer of the
Permits and replace the Seller Bonds. The parties acknowledge that some
Governmental Authorities may not require a permit transfer but may require
updated ownership and control information perhaps with a bond replacement
and/or the issuance of a new license or mine number and that any reference
herein to a permit transfer shall also refer to bond replacement and/or
ownership and control information or issuance of a new license or mine number.
Prior to filing, Buyer shall deliver to Agent copies of the Transfer
Applications. Sellers will cooperate with Buyer and take all actions necessary
to complete all necessary forms to effect the Transfer Applications and to
effect Buyer's ability to operate under Sellers' permits during the Permits
Transfer Period described below.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(b) Post-Filing Obligations. Buyer shall diligently pursue and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to expeditiously secure the transfer of all
the Permits within the Permits Transfer Period, which shall include, but is
not limited to, cooperating with the relevant Governmental Authorities,
participating in the public comment process, and working with interested
parties and neighboring landowners. In the event Buyer fails to secure
transfer of (i) all Permits (other than Permits for which there is a pending
action) within three (3) months from the Closing Date and (ii) all Permits for
which there is a pending action within twelve (12) months from the Closing
Date, then Buyer shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of Sellers the amount of
any and all reasonable costs, expenses or damages incurred by Sellers or their
Affiliates resulting from such failure, provided however, that if such failure
is caused by Sellers' actions (including any failure by Sellers to take any
necessary action), then Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount of any and all
reasonable costs, expenses or damages incurred by Buyers or their Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies following the Closing) resulting from such
failure.

  

  

(c) Violations. During the period of time from the Closing Date until the
applications for the transfer of control of the Acquired Companies has been
accepted by the relevant Governmental Authorities ("Permits Transfer Period"),
if Sellers receive a notice of violation under any of the Permits, it will
give Buyer and the applicable Acquired Company (as owned by Buyer) prompt
notice thereof. During the Permits Transfer Period, Buyer and the applicable
Acquired Company (as owned by Buyer) shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to timely cure such violation. If Sellers reasonably determine that
Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company (as owned by Buyer) will not cause
such violation to be cured in a timely fashion during the Permits Transfer
Period, they shall have the right to cure, or cause to be cured, such
violation and be reimbursed by Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company (as
owned by Buyer) for all reasonable costs incurred in curing such violation.

  

  

6.11 Confidentiality. The provisions of that certain letter agreement by and
between Resource Partners and Buyer dated December 14, 2010 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), shall continue to apply to the parties as though
all such parties were original signatories thereto. If this Agreement is
terminated for any reason whatsoever, the parties shall continue to be bound
by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and the Buyer shall return to
the Company all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of "Evaluation Material"
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) that are in its possession.

  

  

6.12 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Proration of Straddle Period. In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is
attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

  

  

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax years of each of the
Acquired Companies (and each partnership in which any of the Acquired
Companies is a partner) ended with (and included) the Closing Date; and

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets of any Acquired Company, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
in the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

  

  

(b) Transfer Taxes. All excise, sales, use, transfer (including real property
transfer or gains), stamp and other similar taxes, together with any interest,
additions or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of
such additions or penalties, resulting directly from the Contemplated
Transactions (the "Transfer Taxes"), if any, shall be borne equally by Buyer,
on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand. If Sellers, on the one hand,
or Buyer, on the other hand, pay any Transfer Taxes then the other party shall
reimburse the paying party for one half of such Transfer Taxes actually paid.
Any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible
under the applicable local law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party
shall use reasonable commercial efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the
other party at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns.

  

  

(c) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

  

  

(i) The Buyer and each of the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and, upon the other party's
request, the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Buyer and each of the
Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, agree
to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Acquired Companies relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by the other party, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority.

  

  

(ii) The Buyer and the Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions).

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

   
 

6.13 Employee Plans. Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,
provide each individual who is employed by any of the Acquired Companies on
the Closing Date and who continues employment with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies after Closing) after the Closing
Date (the "Continuing Employees") with a position providing base pay that is
at least equal to the base pay provided to such Continuing Employees by the
applicable Acquired Company immediately prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in
this Section 6.13, however, will limit the right of Buyer to terminate or
suspend employment of any Continuing Employee after the Closing, subject only
to the provisions of Section 6.15. For a period of at least twelve (12) months
beginning on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to Continuing Employees, employee benefits and programs that,
individually or in the aggregate, are substantially similar either to the
Employee Benefit Plans maintained or contributed to by the Acquired Companies
(as the case may be) for employees of the Acquired Companies as of the date of
this Agreement or to employee benefit plans and programs provided by the Buyer
to similar situated employees of the Buyer on the date as of which the
substantially similar comparison is made. Continuing Employees shall receive
full credit for their services with the Acquired Companies for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting in benefits under any employee benefit
plans and programs of the Buyer and its controlled group of corporations in
which they are eligible to participate; provided, that no credit shall be
given for purposes of benefit accrual or entitlement to severance benefits or
if the service credit would result in a duplication of benefits. For the
entire calendar year of 2011, Continuing Employees shall be permitted to take
earned but not taken vacation time-off as provided in Sellers' vacation time-
off policy. Buyer shall provide the Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments, out-of-pocket expenses and
deductibles paid (to the same extent such credit was given under a
corresponding benefit plan prior to the Closing Date) in satisfying any
applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements in respect of
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

  

  

6.14 Antitrust Notification.

  

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, Buyer and Agent, on behalf of Sellers shall make all pre-
transaction notification filings required under the HSR Act (which shall be
made no later than seven (7) Business Days after the date of this Agreement)
and any other filing under any statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of preventing monopolization, restraints of trade or abusing a dominant
position (collectively, "Antitrust Laws") of any country, state, province or
jurisdiction of competent jurisdiction requiring a notification and
observation of a waiting period or requiring prior approval before
consummating the Contemplated Transactions and the other Transaction Documents
("Pre-Transaction Notification Rules"). Each of Buyer and Sellers shall: (i)
cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its determination as to whether and which Pre-Transaction
Notification Rules are necessary or advisable and the preparation of any
filings under any Pre-Transaction Notification Rules; (ii) keep the other
party reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to any Governmental Authority charged with enforcing,
applying, administering, or investigating any Antitrust Law, including the
United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of
Justice, any attorney general of any state of the United States or any other
competition authority of any jurisdiction ("Antitrust Authority"), and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party related to the Antitrust Laws, in each case, regarding this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents and in a manner that protects attorney-
client or attorney work product privilege; and (iii) permit the other party to
review and incorporate the other party's reasonable comments in any
communication given by it to any Governmental Authority or in connection with
any proceeding by a private party related to Antitrust Laws with any other
Person, in each case, regarding the Contemplated Transactions and in a manner
that protects attorney-client or attorney work product privilege. Unless
otherwise agreed and without limiting the obligations stated in this Section
6.14(a), Buyer and Sellers shall each use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure the prompt expiration of any applicable waiting
period under any Pre-Transaction Notification Rules and approval by any
relevant Antitrust Authority. Further, without limiting the obligations stated
in this Section 6.14(a), Buyer and Sellers shall each use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to and comply with any
request for information any Governmental Authority regarding the Contemplated
Transactions or filings under any Pre-Transaction Notification Rules. Neither
party hereto shall initiate, or participate in any meeting or discussion with
any Governmental Authority with respect to any filings, applications,
investigation, or other inquiry regarding the Contemplated Transactions or
filings under any Pre-Transaction Notification Rules without giving the other
party reasonable prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent
permitted by the relevant Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend
and participate (which, at the request of any party, shall be limited to
outside antitrust counsel only).

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) The parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected
from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine,
joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this section so as
to preserve any applicable privilege.

  

  

(c) No party shall take any action with the intention to or that could
reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or any
necessary approval of any antitrust authority under any Pre-Transaction
Notification Rule or Antitrust Law or the expiration of the required waiting
period under the Pre-Transaction Notification Rules or any other Antitrust
Laws.

  

  

6.15 WARN Act. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.13, Sellers agree
that prior to the Closing, and Buyer agrees that for ninety (90) days after
the Closing, Sellers or Buyer shall not, and shall not allow any of the
Acquired Companies to, take any act or allow any failure to act that would be
a violation of any WARN Act. Sellers covenant and agree that, from the date
hereof through the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause each of the
Acquired Companies, not to terminate more than 30 employees of the Acquired
Companies, in the aggregate, without notice to and the consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

   
 

6.16 Schedules. At all times prior to the Closing, Sellers shall provide Buyer
with written notification, which notification may be in the form of a written
update to the schedules (each, an "Update"), of any change, fact, event,
occurrence or other information of any kind whatsoever, whether arising before
or after the date of this Agreement, which, except as provided in this Section
6.16, causes or constitutes a breach of any representation or warranty made by
Sellers or that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions
set forth in Article VII impossible. Any Update shall specify each portion of
any representation and warranty or condition affected by such Update. Sellers
shall provide to Buyer such information as Buyer may reasonably request in
order to review any matter disclosed in any Update. In connection with
determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by
Sellers in this Agreement for the purposes of Article X, (a) the delivery of
an Update with respect to any event, fact or matter existing but not disclosed
in an applicable schedule as of the date of this Agreement (a "Pre-Signing
Event Update") shall not cure or otherwise affect or be deemed a waiver of any
breach of a representation or warranty made as of the date hereof and such
Pre-Signing Event Update shall not qualify any such representation and
warranty as of the date of this Agreement, and (b) the delivery of an Update
with respect to any event, fact or matter first arising after the date of this
Agreement (a "Post-Signing Event Update") shall be deemed to supplement or
amend the schedules solely for the purpose of qualifying the portions of the
representations and warranties specified in the Post-Signing Event Update as
the same are made at and as of the Closing as if such Post-Signing Event
Update had been incorporated into the schedules theretofore in effect;
provided, however, after delivery of a Post-Signing Event Update to Buyer,
Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to
Sellers unless Sellers agree in the Post-Signing Event Update that such Post-
Signing Event Update shall not be deemed to effect or to qualify any
representation or warranty for purposes of making the representations and
warranties herein at and as of the Closing provided that if Seller does not
agree and Buyer does not exercise its right to terminate and the Closing
occurs, Buyer Indemnitee's right to indemnification shall be deemed to have
been waived. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, neither
the delivery of an Update nor any Closing thereafter shall be deemed a waiver
of any Buyer Indemnitee's right to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(a)
for any breach or nonfulfillment by Sellers of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of any Update
or for any breach of any representation or warranty made at and as of the date
of this Agreement. In connection with determining the accuracy of any of the
representations and warranties made by Sellers in this Agreement for the
purposes of determining whether any of the conditions set forth in Article VII
has been satisfied (including the condition in Section 7.1), all Updates,
including Post-Signing Event Updates, shall be disregarded. If an Update is
delivered within three (3) Business Days of the Closing, Buyer shall be
entitled, at its option, to delay the Closing by three (3) Business Days. Each
Update shall specify whether it is a Pre-Signing Event Update or a Post-
Signing Event Update.

  

  

6.17 Release.

  

  

(a) As of the Closing, Sellers, in their individual capacity and on behalf of
their respective Affiliates, and to the extent Sellers have the authority, any
Related Person of any of the foregoing and all Persons claiming by, through,
for or under Sellers on behalf of Sellers, hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally release, settle, cancel, discharge and acknowledge to be fully
and finally satisfied any and all claims, demands, rights, actions, causes of
action, debts, accounts, covenants, contracts, agreements, promises, damages,
costs, reimbursements, compensation, liabilities and expenses, including
attorney's fees, of any and every kind, nature or description whatsoever,
known or unknown, at law or in equity (including with respect to the
allocation among Sellers of the proportionate amount of consideration received
pursuant to the Contemplated Transactions) other than those that Sellers may
have against Buyer arising under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document (subject to the terms of this Agreement) (collectively, "Sellers
Claims and Losses"), which Sellers or any of their respective Related Parties,
or any other Person claiming by, through, for or under Sellers on behalf of
Sellers, may have had or may now have or assert against (i) Buyer and its
Affiliates, (ii) any of the Acquired Companies (collectively with Buyer and
its Affiliates, "Buyer Released Parties"), which are on account of any matter
whatsoever attributed to the period, or arising during the period, from the
beginning of time through and including and ending at the Closing (all Sellers
Claims and Losses released in this Section 6.14 being referred to as the
"Sellers Released Claims").

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) Sellers agree that neither Sellers nor their Related Parties, nor anyone
claiming under, through or for them or on their behalf will bring, file,
institute, prosecute, maintain, participate in, or recover upon, either
directly or indirectly, or encourage or benefit from the institution of any
suit, charge, administrative proceeding, investigation, or action at law or in
equity against the Buyer Released Parties, or any of them, in or before any
court, agency or forum, state or federal, or otherwise, for or relating to any
of the Sellers Released Claims. Sellers agree that this release may be pleaded
by the Buyer Released Parties as a counterclaim or cross-claim to or as a
defense in bar or abatement of any Sellers Released Claim. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, this Section 6.17 shall not preclude Sellers
nor their Related Parties, nor anyone claiming under, through or for them from
asserting any claim against the Buyer Released Parties or any of them
resulting from any third-party claim against Sellers or such persons for
actions of the Acquired Companies or any of the Buyer Related Parties or any
claims under Article X.

  

  

6.18 Employees. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall cause (i) each of the
officers and employees of IRP Administrative Services, LLC ("IRP
Administrative") who spend a substantial portion of their business time
performing services on behalf of the Acquired Companies rather than IRP
Administrative to become officers or employees of one or more of the Acquired
Companies, (ii) each of the employment agreements that any such officer or
employee is a party to as set forth on Schedule 6.18 to be assigned by IRP
Administrative to the applicable Acquired Company and (iii) each such officer
or employee to consent to such assignment of his employment agreement, agree
that such assignment is not included within the definition of "Good Reason" as
defined in his or her employment agreement and waive any rights to any "change
of control" or similar payments such officer or employee may have under such
employment agreement from Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies. For purposes
of this Agreement, any officer or employee of IRP Administrative Services that
will become an officer or employee of one or more of the Acquired Companies
prior to the Closing shall be deemed a "Company Employee."

provided, however, that Buyer shall have no obligation to indemnify any Seller
Indemnitee to the extent that Sellers are required to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees or would be so required but for the limitations set forth in
Section 10.1(d).

  

  

(c) Survival of Representations, Warranties and Indemnities. The
representations, warranties, covenants, undertakings and agreements of the
parties contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant hereto, and the rights of the parties to seek
indemnification with respect thereto, shall survive the Closing for a period
of fourteen (14) months from the Closing Date, except that the representations
and warranties in Section 3.3 (Interests) and Section 3A.4 (Interests) shall
survive indefinitely (for each type of indemnification claim, the "Indemnity
Termination Date"). Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement which
is made in good faith and in a writing specifying the factual basis of the
claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by the claiming party
prior to the expiration of the applicable Indemnity Termination Date shall
survive such expiration until mutually resolved or otherwise determined
hereunder, as applicable, and the applicable Indemnity Termination Date for
all purposes hereunder shall automatically be extended with respect to such
claim (but not any other claims) until such claim is so mutually resolved or
otherwise determined hereunder. Any claim not so made prior to the expiration
of the applicable Indemnity Termination Date shall be deemed to have been
waived.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

(d) Limitations. Any recovery by any party under this Article X with respect
to claims for indemnification pursuant to this Section 10.1 shall be limited
as follows:

  

  

(i) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses under Article X
arising out of or resulting from the causes that may be recovered from Sellers
shall not exceed the amounts then remaining of the General Escrow Amount in
the Escrow Fund; provided that, notwithstanding anything in this Section
10.1(d) to the contrary, in no event will the limitations set forth in this
Section 10.1(d)(i) apply with respect to any breach of any representation,
warranty, or covenant or obligation pursuant to Section 3.3 (Interests) and
Section 3A.4 (Interests); provided, however, that no Seller shall be liable
for the amount of idemnifiable Losses exceeding, on an aggregate basis, the
portion of the Purchase Price received by such Seller;

  

  

(ii) No party shall be entitled to any recovery unless and until the total of
all claims brought by such party for indemnity or damages pursuant to this
Section 10.1 exceeds $500,000 and such party then shall be entitled to recover
only the amount by which such claims for indemnity or damages exceed $500,000;
provided that, notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.1(d) to the
contrary, in no event will the limitations set forth in this Section
10.1(d)(ii) apply (x) in the event of fraud, willful misconduct or bad faith,
(y) with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or
obligation pursuant to Section 3.3 (Interests) and Section 3A.4 (Interests),
and (z) with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
10.1(a)(iv), (v), (vi), or (vii); and

  

  

(iii) The remedies set forth in this Article X and Sections 2.7 and 2.8 and
the specific performance remedy referenced in Section 11.18 shall provide the
sole and exclusive remedies arising from this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Procedure for Indemnification - Third Party Claims.

  

  

(i) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 10.1(a) or
Section 10.1(b) of notice of the commencement of any proceeding against it,
such indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying
party under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party
will not relieve the indemnifying party of any Liability that it may have to
any indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the indemnifying
party's failure to give such notice.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

(ii) If any proceeding referred to in Section 10.1(e)(i) is brought against an
indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such proceeding, the indemnifying party will be entitled to
participate in such proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (A)
the indemnifying party is also a party to such proceeding and the indemnified
party determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate, or (B) the indemnifying party fails to provide reasonable
assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity to defend such
proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such proceeding), to
assume the defense of such proceeding with counsel satisfactory to the
indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to the
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such proceeding,
the indemnifying party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such
defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 10 for any fees
of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such
proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in
connection with the defense of such proceeding, other than reasonable costs of
investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a proceeding,
(1) it will be conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that
the claims made in that proceeding are within the scope of and subject to
indemnification; and (2) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be
effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified party's consent
unless (x) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Laws or any
violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that
may be made against the indemnified party, and (y) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying party; and (z) the
indemnified party will have no Liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of such claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to
an indemnifying party of the commencement of any proceeding and the
indemnifying party does not, within ten (10) days after the indemnified
party's notice is given, give notice to the indemnified party of its election
to assume the defense of such proceeding, the indemnifying party will be bound
by any determination made in such proceeding or any compromise or settlement
effected by the indemnified party.

  

  

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in
good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a proceeding may
adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary
damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such proceeding,
but the indemnifying party will not be bound by compromise or settlement
effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).

  

  

(f) Procedure for Indemnification - Other Claims. A claim for indemnification
for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be asserted by notice to
the party from whom indemnification is sought.

  

  

(g) Punitive Damages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, no indemnifying party shall be liable to an indemnified party
for any punitive damages, special damages, indirect damages, or similar items
except to the extent that a Buyer Indemnitee has become liable to any third
party for such punitive damages, special damages, indirect damages, or similar
items resulting from a third party claim for which indemnification is provided
for in Section 10.1(a).

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

   
 

10.2 Treatment of Indemnification Payments.

  

  

All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by
Buyer and Sellers as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  

  

ARTICLE XI

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

11.1 Agent. IRP GP ("Agent") is hereby appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact
for each Seller, and through the Closing, for each Acquired Company, for and
on behalf of Sellers and the Acquired Companies, to act as Agent for Sellers
and the Acquired Companies under this Agreement and each other Transaction
Document, and to give and receive notices and communications, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
claims for indemnification, to authorize delivery to Buyer or any Buyer
Indemnitee of any payment hereunder, and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing
in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and each other
Transaction Document. Notices or communications to or from Agent hereunder
shall constitute notice to or from each Seller or, at or prior to the Closing,
the Acquired Companies. Sellers and the Acquired Companies hereby agree that
the appointment of Agent pursuant to this Section 11.1 shall be irrevocable
except as otherwise provided herein or by non-waivable provisions of
Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such appointment shall be
automatically revoked as to the Acquired Companies as of the completion of the
Closing. Any decision, act, consent or instruction of Agent relating to this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall constitute a decision of all
of Sellers and, if prior to or at the Closing, the Acquired Companies, and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller and the Acquired
Companies (but, with respect to the Acquired Companies, only to the extent
related to any time period ending at or prior to the Closing) and Buyer may
rely upon any such written decision, consent or instruction of Agent as being
the decision, consent or instruction of each and every Seller and the Acquired
Companies. Buyer and the other Buyer Indemnitees are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, consent or instruction of Agent. Sellers hereby jointly and
severally agree to indemnify and hold Agent, its affiliates and their
officers, employees, successors, assigns, attorneys and agents harmless from
all losses, costs, claims, demands, expenses, damages, penalties and
attorney's fees suffered or incurred by such Agent as a result of anything
which it may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement or any
Transaction Document or any litigation or cause or action arising from or in
conjunction with this Agreement or any Transaction Document or involving the
subject matter hereof; provided that the foregoing indemnification shall not
extend to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

   
 

11.2 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Sellers and Buyer shall bear their own expenses and the expenses of their
respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Sellers, each Acquired
Company and Agent) in connection with the preparation and negotiation of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers and Buyer shall each pay one-half of
the fee for the Notification and Report Forms filed with the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under the HSR Act. Sellers and Buyer
shall bear the fees and expenses of any broker or finder retained by such
party and their respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Sellers, each
Acquired Company and Agent) in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

  

  

11.3 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed under and governed by
the Laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of laws
principles.

  

  

11.4 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented
except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement that
specifically references this Agreement and is executed by the party to be
charged with the amendment. Any amendment, modification or supplement signed
by Agent shall be binding on and effective against all Sellers and, prior to
Closing, the Acquired Companies.

  

  

11.5 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Buyer may assign any of its
rights under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates at any time. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and is not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns any rights or remedies hereunder.

  

  

11.6 Waiver. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party
in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) no claim or
right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or
renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other
party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in
the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on
one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of
the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action
without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents
referred to in this Agreement. Any waiver given by Agent shall be binding on
and effective against all Sellers and, prior to Closing, the Acquired
Companies.

4.2 Each Buyer Indemnitee, to the extent entitled to receive payment pursuant
to Section 2.8(b) or to be indemnified pursuant to Article X of the Purchase
Agreement or, if Buyer so elects pursuant to Section 4.3(e) hereof, pursuant
to Section 2.8(c)(iii) of the Purchase Agreement, shall be entitled to claim
such amounts as provided in the Purchase Agreement and receive payments from
the General Escrow Fund, in each case, in accordance with the following
provisions:

  

  

If any Buyer Indemnitee believes that it has incurred any Losses for which it
is entitled to indemnification under Article X of the Purchase Agreement or
payment under Sections 2.8(b) or 2.8(c)(iii), Buyer shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent written notice (a "Claim Notice") (i) naming the Buyer Indemnitee
making the claim (the "Buyer Indemnified Person"), (ii) describing such Losses
and, to the extent known, the amount thereof (the "Claim Amount"), (iii)
stating that the Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to payment under Section
2.8(b) or Section 2.8(c)(iii) or indemnification under Article X of the
Purchase Agreement for such Losses and providing a reasonable explanation of
the basis thereof, and (iv) demanding payment in the amount of such Losses, to
the extent such Losses are known and then incurred. The Claim Notice must be
given prior to the Escrow Release Date in order to be eligible to receive
payments from the General Escrow Fund. At the time of delivery of any Claim
Notice to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Claim Notice shall be
delivered by Buyer to Seller Agent. Promptly, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after its receipt of the Claim Notice (and notwithstanding any
prior delivery of the Claim Notice by Buyer to Seller Agent), the Escrow Agent
shall deliver a copy of the Claim Notice to Seller Agent. Subject to Paragraph
4.2(b) hereof, the Escrow Agent shall, promptly after the thirtieth (30th) day
after the Escrow Agent's delivery of a copy of the Claim Notice to Seller
Agent (such 30-day period, the "Response Period"), (x) with respect to
indemnification or payment for a specified amount, pay or distribute to the
Buyer Indemnified Person named in the Claim Notice cash out of the General
Escrow Fund in the amount specified in the Claim Notice or (y) with respect to
contingent indemnification or payment claims not then payable pursuant to the
terms of the Claim Notice, designate and segregate out of the General Escrow
Fund the contingent amount subject to the Claim Notice. Payment shall be
distributed as specified in the Claim Notice. Buyer, on behalf of itself or
any other Buyer Indemnitee, shall in all cases be the only provider of Claim
Notices. "Business Day" means any day that is not (i) a Saturday, Sunday or
other day on which banks are required or authorized by applicable law to be
closed in the City of Charleston, West Virginia and the City of New York, New
York or (ii) any other day on which the Escrow Agent is closed for business.

  

  

Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 4.2(a) hereof, the Escrow Agent
shall not make any payment from the General Escrow Fund with respect to a
Claim Notice if, during the Response Period, Seller Agent shall have delivered
to the Escrow Agent a written objection to the claim for indemnification or
payment made or the Claim Amount set forth in the Claim Notice (an
"Objection"). If the Escrow Agent does not receive an Objection within the
Response Period, then Seller Agent shall be deemed to have acknowledged the
obligation to indemnify or make such payment, as applicable, and the
correctness of such Claim Amount for the full amount thereof subject to a
current claim for payment as specified in the Claim Notice. At the time of
delivery of any Objection to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such
Objection shall be delivered by Seller Agent to Buyer.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-3-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Upon receipt of an Objection pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall (i) deliver notice of the Objection to Buyer, (ii) distribute to
the Buyer Indemnified Person cash out of the General Escrow Fund in an amount
equal to that portion, if any, specified in the Claim Notice which is not
disputed by Seller Agent in such Objection, and (iii) designate and segregate
out of the General Escrow Fund the amount subject to the Claim Notice which is
disputed by Seller Agent in the Objection or is not then payable pursuant to
the terms of the Claim Notice. Thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall not
distribute to the Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Agent the segregated
portion of the General Escrow Fund subject to the Claim Notice until the
Escrow Agent shall have received joint written instructions from Buyer and
Seller Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Escrow
Agent, concerning the determination of the amount of the indemnification
payment, if any, to which the Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled.

  

  

After an Objection has been delivered to the Escrow Agent and Buyer, Buyer and
Seller Agent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the Buyer
Indemnified Person with respect to each of the amounts that comprise the
asserted Claim Amount (or the amount subject to the Claim Notice which is
disputed by Seller Agent in the Objection). If Buyer and Seller Agent should
so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by both Buyer and Seller Agent and, in the case of a demand for
recovery from the General Escrow Fund, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint
written instructions from Buyer and Seller Agent setting forth such agreement.
If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation within 30
days after delivery of an Objection, either Seller Agent or Buyer may pursue
any and all remedies as shall be available to such party pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that if such dispute relates to a claim
for payment related to any Prior Violations pursuant to Section 2.8(c)(iii) of
the Purchase Agreement, the amounts in dispute shall be submitted to binding
arbitration as set forth in Section 2.8(c)(iv) of the Purchase Agreement. The
Escrow Agent will (i) pay the Buyer Indemnified Person out of the General
Escrow Fund the amount that the Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to
receive as promptly as practicable after receiving joint written instructions
concerning such final determination from Buyer and Seller Agent and (ii) if
applicable, cause to be distributed to Seller Agent, for the benefit of and
distribution to Sellers, such amount as to which Sellers would be entitled to
distribution under Paragraph 4.6 hereof after giving effect to the foregoing
joint written instructions.

  

  

4.3 Buyer, to the extent entitled to payment related to any Prior Violations
pursuant to Section 2.8(c) of the Purchase Agreement, shall be entitled to
claim such amounts equal to such Buyer Indemnitee's Losses and receive
payments from the Special Escrow Fund, in each case, in accordance with the
following provisions:

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-4-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(a) If Buyer has incurred any Losses or other damages for which it is entitled
to payment under Section 2.8(c) of the Purchase Agreement, Buyer shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent a Claim Notice (i) describing such Losses and, to the
extent known, the Claim Amount, (ii) stating that the Buyer Indemnified Person
is entitled to payment under Section 2.8(c) of the Purchase Agreement for such
Losses and providing a reasonable explanation of the basis thereof, and (iii)
demanding payment in the amount of such Losses, to the extent such Losses are
known and then incurred. The Claim Notice must be given prior to the Final
Release Date in order to be eligible to receive payments from the Special
Escrow Fund. At the time of delivery of any Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent,
a duplicate copy of such Claim Notice shall be delivered by Buyer to Seller
Agent. Promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days after its
receipt of the Claim Notice (and notwithstanding any prior delivery of the
Claim Notice by Buyer to Seller Agent), the Escrow Agent shall deliver a copy
of the Claim Notice to Seller Agent. Subject to Paragraph 4.3(b) hereof, the
Escrow Agent shall, promptly after the Response Period, (x) with respect to
payment for a specified amount, pay or distribute to Buyer, cash out of the
Special Escrow Fund in the amount specified in the Claim Notice or (y) with
respect to contingent payment claims not then payable pursuant to the terms of
the Claim Notice, designate and segregate out the contingent amount subject to
the Claim Notice. Payment shall be distributed as specified in the Claim
Notice.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 4.3(a) hereof, the Escrow
Agent shall not make any payment from the Special Escrow Fund with respect to
a Claim Notice if, during the Response Period, Seller Agent shall have
delivered to the Escrow Agent an Objection. If the Escrow Agent does not
receive an Objection within the Response Period, then Seller Agent shall be
deemed to have acknowledged the obligation to indemnify and the correctness of
such Claim Amount for the full amount thereof subject to a current claim for
payment as specified in the Claim Notice. At the time of delivery of any
Objection to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Objection shall be
delivered by Seller Agent to Buyer.

  

  

(c) Upon receipt of an Objection pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall (i) deliver notice of the Objection to Buyer, (ii) distribute to
Buyer cash out of the Special Escrow Fund in an amount equal to that portion,
if any, specified in the Claim Notice which is not disputed by Seller Agent in
such Objection, and (iii) designate and segregate out of the Special Escrow
Fund the amount subject to the Claim Notice which is disputed by Seller Agent
in the Objection or is not then payable pursuant to the terms of the Claim
Notice. Thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall not distribute to Buyer or Seller
Agent the segregated portion of the Special Escrow Fund subject to the Claim
Notice until the Escrow Agent shall have received joint written instructions
from Buyer and Seller Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Escrow Agent, concerning the determination of the amount of the payment,
if any, to which Buyer is entitled.

  

  

(d) After an Objection has been delivered to the Escrow Agent and Buyer, Buyer
and Seller Agent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of Buyer
with respect to each of the amounts that comprise the asserted Claim Amount
(or the amount subject to the Claim Notice which is disputed by Seller Agent
in the Objection). If Buyer and Seller Agent should so agree, a memorandum
setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Buyer and
Seller Agent and, in the case of a demand for recovery from the Special Escrow
Fund, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions from Buyer
and Seller Agent setting forth such agreement. If no such agreement can be
reached after good faith negotiation within 30 days after delivery of an
Objection, the amounts in dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration as
set forth in Section 2.8(c)(iv) of the Purchase Agreement. The Escrow Agent
will (i) pay Buyer out of the Special Escrow Fund the amount that Buyer is
entitled to receive as promptly as practicable after receiving joint written
instructions concerning such final determination from Buyer and Seller Agent
and (ii) if applicable, cause to be distributed to Seller Agent, for the
benefit of and distribution to Sellers, such amount as to which Sellers would
be entitled to distribution under Paragraph 4.7 hereof after giving effect to
the foregoing joint written instructions.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-5-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the Escrow Release Date Mine 8
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement) is designated on a Pattern of Violation
(POV) list by the Mine Safety and Health Administration that is attributable
to the Prior Violations, Buyer shall be entitled to payment related to any
Prior Violations pursuant to Section 2.8(c)(iii) of the Purchase Agreement,
Buyer shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to submit a Claim Notice
for Losses or other damages to the Escrow Agent and receive payments from the
General Escrow Fund before proceeding against the Special Escrow Fund.

  

  

4.4 At any time prior to the final termination of this Escrow Agreement, the
Escrow Agent shall, if jointly instructed in a writing signed by Buyer and
Seller Agent, release or cause to be released from the Escrow Fund to Buyer or
Seller Agent, for the benefit of and distribution to Sellers, as directed, the
amount of cash specified in any such writing.

  

  

4.5 The Escrow Agent shall not dispose of all or any portion of the amounts in
the Escrow Fund other than as specifically provided in this Escrow Agreement.

  

  

4.6 On the fourteen (14) month anniversary of the date of this Escrow
Agreement (the "Escrow Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall cause to be
distributed from the General Escrow Fund to:

  

  

(a) Buyer, as promptly as practicable after receiving joint written
instructions from Buyer and Seller Agent, an amount equal to (1) $5,000,000
less amounts previously paid to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.8(b)(iv) of the
Purchase Agreement multiplied by (2) the ratio of (x) 10,000,000 minus the
number of tons of Additional Reserves (as defined in the Purchase Agreement)
proven prior to the Escrow Release Date to (y) 10,000,000 (plus any accrued
interest or earnings on such amount); provided, however, that if the number of
tons of Additional Reserves is equal to or greater than 10,000,000 tons, Buyer
shall not be entitled to any distribution from the General Escrow Fund
pursuant to this Paragraph 4.6(a); and

  

  

(b) To Seller Agent, for the benefit of and distribution to Sellers, an amount
equal to (1) any amount then remaining in the General Escrow Fund (including
any remaining accrued interest or earnings thereon), less (2) if the
distribution contemplated by Paragraph 4.6(a) hereof has not occurred, the
amount that Buyer claims to be entitled to pursuant to Paragraph 4.6(a) as
certified to the Escrow Agent in writing by Buyer no later than the Business
Day preceding the Escrow Release Date, less (3) any amount subject to a Claim
Notice delivered prior to the Escrow Release Date pursuant to Paragraph 4.2 to
the extent such Claim Notice has not been resolved prior to such date. Any
amount retained in escrow from the General Escrow Fund after the Escrow
Release Date pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be held by the Escrow
Agent and shall be used to make any such distribution or distributions
contemplated by Paragraph 4.2 hereof and to indemnify or make a payment to the
Buyer Indemnitees for such unresolved Claim Notices subject to the terms and
conditions of the Purchase Agreement (but only as to Buyer and Seller Agent)
and this Escrow Agreement (being the only document by which the Escrow Agent
is bound) and upon resolution and if applicable payment out of the General
Escrow Fund in satisfaction of the foregoing, any remaining amounts in escrow
(including any remaining interest or earnings thereon), shall be promptly
distributed by, on behalf of or at the direction of, the Escrow Agent to
Seller Agent, for the benefit of and distribution to Sellers.

4.7 Upon the final resolution of all legal proceedings and fines relating to
the Prior Violations, or on joint written direction of Buyer and Seller Agent
(such date, the "Final Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall pay to Seller
Agent, for the benefit of and distribution to Sellers, an amount equal to (1)
any amount then remaining in the Special Escrow Fund (including any remaining
accrued interest or earnings thereon), less (2) any amount subject to a Claim
Notice delivered prior to the Final Release Date pursuant to Paragraph 4.3 to
the extent such Claim Notices has not been resolved prior to such date. Any

Date pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be held by the Escrow Agent and
shall be used to make any such distribution or distributions contemplated by
Paragraph 4.3 hereof and to make a payment to Buyer for such unresolved Claim
Notices subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement (but

LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION OF ESCROW AGENT.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

6.1 The Escrow Agent's obligations and duties in connection herewith are
confined to those specifically enumerated in this Escrow Agreement, which
obligations and duties shall be deemed purely ministerial, and not fiduciary,
in nature. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to take notice of the
Purchase Agreement and shall have no duty or responsibility to take any action
pursuant thereto. The Escrow Agent shall not be in any manner liable or
responsible for the sufficiency, correctness, genuineness, or validity of any
documents deposited with it or with reference to the form of execution
thereof, or the identity, authority, or rights of any Person executing or
depositing the same, and the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss
that may occur by reason of forgery, false representation, or the exercise of
its discretion in any particular manner or for any other reason, except for
its own fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent shall
not be required to act upon or take notice of any direction, demand, notice,
communication or instructions provided to the Escrow Agent by any Seller, but
shall act upon and take notice solely of notices, communications or
instructions provided to the Escrow Agent by Seller Agent and Buyer as
provided for herein. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability with respect to
the transfer or distribution of any funds effected by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to wiring or transfer instructions provided to the Escrow Agent by
any party to this Escrow Agreement in accordance with the provisions of this
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal
action or to commence any proceedings in connection with the Escrow Fund or
this Escrow Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute or defend in any such legal
action or proceedings.

  

  

6.2 The Seller Agent, on behalf of each Seller, and Buyer jointly and
severally covenant and agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Escrow
Agent and its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including without limitation, reasonable costs of investigation and
counsel fees and disbursements which may be imposed on the Escrow Agent or
incurred directly or indirectly in connection with this Escrow Agreement, its
acceptance of this appointment as the Escrow Agent hereunder, or of the
performance of its duties hereunder, including without limitation, any
litigation arising from this Escrow Agreement or involving the subject matter
hereof; provided, that if the Escrow Agent shall be found guilty of fraud,
willful misconduct or gross negligence in connection with its services under
this Escrow Agreement then, in that event, the Escrow Agent shall bear all
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses; provided further,
that solely as between Buyer and Sellers, this Paragraph 6.2 hereof shall not
prejudice any right or obligations of Buyer and Sellers among themselves
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The provisions of this Paragraph 6.2
hereof shall survive the termination of this Escrow Agreement and any
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.

  

  

6.3 If a dispute occurs among the parties hereto or otherwise with respect to
the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to tender into the
registry or custody of any court of competent jurisdiction, upon an order of
such court, all of the Escrow Fund, together with such legal pleadings as it
or its counsel deems appropriate, and, thereupon be discharged from all
further duties and liabilities under this Escrow Agreement. The filing of any
such legal proceedings shall not deprive the Escrow Agent of its compensation
(as provided for herein) earned prior to such filing and the provisions of
Paragraph 6.1 hereof shall survive as to such action.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-8-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

6.4 The Escrow Agent's fees hereunder shall be as set forth in Schedule A
hereto (the "Escrow Agent's Compensation") and shall be paid one-half by the
Seller Agent, on behalf of each Seller, and one-half by Buyer at the times and
in the manner set forth in Schedule A. In addition, Seller Agent, on behalf of
each Seller, and Buyer shall each pay one-half of all other amounts due and
owing Escrow Agent pursuant to Schedule A. This fee is intended as full
compensation for the Escrow Agent's services as contemplated by this Escrow
Agreement; provided, however, that if the conditions of this Escrow Agreement
are not fulfilled or the Escrow Agent renders any reasonably required material
service not contemplated in this Escrow Agreement, or there is any assignment
of interest in the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement, or any material
modification hereof, or if any material controversy arises hereunder, or the
Escrow Agent is made a party to or justifiably intervenes in any litigation
pertaining to this Escrow Agreement or the subject matter hereof, the Escrow
Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and
reimbursed for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorney's fees, occasioned by such controversy, litigation, or
event, and the same shall be payable by Seller Agent, on behalf of each
Seller, and Buyer, pursuant to this Paragraph 6.4 hereof.

  

  

6.5 The Escrow Agent may resign at any time, upon thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Buyer and Seller Agent, and prior to such resignation shall
deposit the Escrow Fund with a successor escrow agent, which shall be a
national bank, to be jointly designated in writing by Buyer and Seller Agent.
Any such successor escrow agent must agree to be, and shall be bound by, and
shall have all the rights, duties, and responsibilities of the Escrow Agent
under this Escrow Agreement. If, upon the effective date of such resignation,
no successor escrow agent shall have been designated, the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to treat such failure to designate a successor as a dispute
subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6.3 hereof. Such resignation shall not
deprive the Escrow Agent of its compensation (as provided for herein) earned
prior thereto.

  

  

6.6 Buyer and Seller Agent may terminate this Escrow Agreement (including in
connection with the appointment of a new escrow agent) by joint written notice
which shall specify the disposition of the Escrow Fund (which disposition must
be in a manner consistent with the Purchase Agreement) and the Escrow Agent
shall, upon receipt thereof, promptly disburse the Escrow Fund in accordance
with such specified disposition.

  

  

6.7 The Escrow Agent may from time to time consult with legal counsel of its
own choosing in the event of any disagreement or controversy or question or
doubt as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or its duties
hereunder, and it shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected in
acting in good faith in accordance with the written opinion or instructions of
such counsel, except in instances of the Escrow Agent's own fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Any reasonable fees and expenses of such
legal counsel shall be considered part of the fees and expenses of the Escrow
Agent described herein.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-9-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

6.8 No provision of this Escrow Agreement shall require the Escrow Agent to
risk or advance its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability or
potential financial liability in the performance of its duties or the exercise
of its rights hereunder.

  

  

6.9 Subject to Paragraph 6.6, any corporation or association into which the
Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be consolidated,
or to which it may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate
trust business and assets as a whole or substantially as a whole, or any
corporation or association resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger,
consolidation or transfer to which the Escrow Agent is a party, shall be and

this Escrow Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Escrow Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise

to this Escrow Agreement (other than the Escrow Agent) shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a Certificate of Incumbency substantially in the
form of Exhibit B-1 and Exhibit B-2 hereto (a "Certificate of Incumbency") for

issue notices, instructions or directions to the Escrow Agent on behalf of
each such party. Until such time as the Escrow Agent shall receive an amended
Certificate of Incumbency replacing any Certificate of Incumbency theretofore
delivered to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be fully protected in
relying, without further inquiry, on the most recent Certificate of Incumbency
furnished to the Escrow Agent. Whenever this Escrow Agreement provides for
joint written notices, joint written instructions or other joint actions to be
delivered to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be fully protected in
relying, without further inquiry, on any joint written notice, instructions or
action executed by persons named in such Certificate of Incumbency.
