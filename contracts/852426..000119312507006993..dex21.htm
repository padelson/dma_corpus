surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (EST) on a date to be
specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"), which date shall be no later

those conditions at such time), at the offices of Kramer Levin Naftalis and
Frankel LLP, 1177 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10022, unless
another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the
Closing Date the Surviving Corporation shall file with the Secretary of State
of the State of Minnesota articles of merger, in such form as is required by,
and executed in accordance with, Minnesota Law (the "Articles of Merger")).
The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Articles of Merger
or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in
the Articles of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is
herein referred to as the "Effective Time").

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all
of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company
and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Minnesota Law.

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, without the need
for any action by any party hereto or by any other Person,

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or
Section 2.04, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash,
without interest (the "Merger Consideration");

(b) each share of Company Stock owned by Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) Subject to Section 2.04, from and after the Effective Time, all of the
Company Stock converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section
2.02 shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate theretofore
representing any such Company Stock (each a "Certificate") shall thereafter
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest, with respect thereto, in accordance
with the applicable provisions of Section 2.03.

Section 2.03.  _Surrender and Payment_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall appoint a paying agent (the "Paying Agent")
for the purpose of exchanging Certificates representing Company Stock
converted into the Merger  



 

5  Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02, and non-certificated Company Stock
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02
and represented by book entries ("Book Entry Shares"), for the Merger
Consideration. The Paying Agent shall also be responsible for paying a Company
Stock Option as contemplated in Section 2.05. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall, deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Stock, cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration to be delivered in respect of the Company
Stock, plus cash sufficient to pay the amounts set forth in Section 2.05 in
respect of the Company Stock Options and the Company Warrants (such aggregate
amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event not less
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the Paying
Agent shall agree upon a final form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that (i) delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the
Paying Agent or by appropriate guarantee of delivery in the form customarily
used in transactions of this nature from a member of a national securities
exchange, a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or
a commercial bank or trust company in the United States, that is a member in
good standing of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program and (ii)
the signature thereof must be guaranteed by such a member or bank or trust
company in the form customarily used in transactions of this nature)
(the "Letter of Transmittal"), for use in effecting delivery of Company Stock
to the Paying Agent and instructions related thereto (the "Instructions").
Promptly after the Letter of Transmittal and Instructions have
been finalized, the Paying Agent shall make the Letter of Transmittal and
Instructions available, upon request, to holders of Company Stock, and
promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the Effective
Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Paying Agent to send, to each
holder of record of Company Stock as of the Effective Time, who has not
previously submitted a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, the Letter of Transmittal and Instructions. Exchange of any
Book-Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with Paying Agents
customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. If a holder of Company Stock surrenders to the
Paying Agent a Certificate, together with a Letter of Transmittal properly
completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably
requested pursuant to the Instructions, at least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date and such holder is the record holder as of the Closing
Date, then the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Paying Agent to pay to the holder of such Certificate on the Closing
Date, in exchange therefor, solely from the Exchange Fund, the Merger
Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax as specified in
Section 2.07), without interest, with respect thereto, and such Certificate
shall forthwith be canceled. If a holder surrenders to the Paying Agent a
Certificate, together with a Letter of Transmittal properly completed and duly
executed (and such other documents as may be reasonably requested pursuant to
the Instructions), any time after two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, and such holder is the record holder as of the Effective Time, then the
holder of such Certificate shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date in exchange therefor by the Paying Agent, solely
from the Exchange Fund,  



 

6  the Merger Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax as
specified in Section 2.07), without interest, with respect thereto, and
such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 2.03(b) may be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate. No interest shall be paid or accrued on
any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or options or
warrants.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of Company Stock upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Company Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and at the
Effective Time the share transfer books of Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration or as provided by Applicable Law.

(d) _Certificate Holder_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment
thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer
or other similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this Article upon conversion of any
Company Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Stock, including any rights to receive
declared but unpaid dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Time.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock for six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent (or its designee), upon
demand, and any holder of Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with
this Article shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Stock as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable  



 

7  Law and subject to the Surviving Corporations obligation in the preceding
sentence, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Parent, Merger Subsidiary, Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official to the extent
required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If
any Certificate has not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on
which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
irrevocably escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority,
any such cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in (i)
direct obligations of the United States, (ii) obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of all principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination
thereof; provided that, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity exceeding three (3) months from the date of the investment therein.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a
bond, and in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the
Merger Consideration represented by such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall pay, in accordance with Section 2.03 (except for the provisions thereof
requiring delivery of such Certificate), in respect of such lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to
each Company Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

Section 2.04.  _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who is entitled to demand and has filed written notice of intent
to demand the fair value of such shares in accordance with Sections 302A.471
and 302A.473 of Minnesota Law ("Dissenters Rights") shall not be converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the such Dissenters Rights. If, after
the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such
Dissenters Rights, such shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for the fair value of shares of Company Stock
pursuant to Minnesota Law, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.



 

8 Section 2.05. Stock _Options and Warrants_. (a) As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, but in any event no later than 30 days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take such actions as are required to provide that each then outstanding
option to purchase shares of Company Stock outstanding under any employee
stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (a "Company
Stock Option"), whether or not vested or exercisable by its terms, shall be
canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of any such option at or
promptly after the Effective Time for each such option an amount (less any
applicable withholding tax as specified in Section 2.07) in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of $33.50 per share of Company Stock over
the applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option by (ii) the number
of shares of Company Stock such holder could have purchased (assuming full
vesting of all options) had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option
in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock (a "Company
Warrant") shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall
pay each holder of a Company Warrant at or promptly after the Effective Time
an amount (less any applicable withholding tax as specified in Section 2.07)
in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of $33.50 per share
of Common Stock over the exercise price of the Company Warrant by (ii) the
number of shares of Common Stock into which such Company Warrant is the
exercisable.

(c) The amounts paid in accordance with Section 2.05(a) and (b) in respect of
the Company Stock Options and the Company Warrants shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock
Options and Company Warrants and the holders of such Company Stock Options and
Company Warrants shall have no further rights pertaining thereto.

Section 2.06. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of
options or warrants outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase shares
granted under the Companys stock option or compensation plans or
arrangements, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.07.  _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of which the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

(a) The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents, and amendments thereto (including exhibits and other
information required to be incorporated therein) with the SEC required to be
filed by the Company since January 1, 2006. The Company has made available to
Parent or filed with the SEC (i) the Companys annual reports on Form 10-K for
its fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, (ii) its quarterly reports on Form

the SEC since December 31, 2005 (the documents referred to in this Section
4.07(a), collectively, the "Company SEC Documents").

(b) As of its filing date, each Company SEC Document complied, and each such
Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will comply, as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933
Act and the 1934 Act, as applicable.



 

13 (c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each such Company SEC Document filed
subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date
such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

(e) The Company has no knowledge of any pending investigation of the Company
by the SEC staff or any currently unresolved comment on the Company SEC
Documents made by the SEC staff.

(f) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive
officer of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the
Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or
15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 ("SOX") with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements

shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX.

(g) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable
assurance that material information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the 1934 Act are being prepared. To the Companys knowledge, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Companys
principal executive officer and principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in the Companys periodic reports
required under the 1934 Act.

(h) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under
the 1934 Act) ("internal controls"). Such internal controls are effective to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys
financial reporting and the preparation of Company financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to
the Companys auditors and audit committee (x) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal  



 

14  controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information
and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in internal controls. The Company has
made available to Parent a summary of any such disclosure made by management
to the Companys auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2006.

(i) None of the Subsidiaries of the Company are, or have at any time since

the time of filing, was prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise
footnoted therein and, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments). The financial projections relating to the Company and the
Subsidiaries that were delivered to Parent in the Confidential Information
Memorandum, dated October 2006 (the "Information Memorandum"), were prepared
on the basis of assumptions the Company reasonably believed in good faith at
the time of delivery of such projections to be fair and reasonable in light of
the conditions existing at such time, and represented at such time the
Companys reasonable estimate of its future financial performance, in each
case, subject to all disclosures, qualifications, or reservations contained in
the Information Memorandum (except for any disclaimers of representations
inconsistent with the representations made in this Section 4.08). The parties
agree and acknowledge that such projections did not constitute a warranty as
to the future performance of the Company and that actual results may vary from
forecasted results.

Section 4.09. _Disclosure Documents_. The proxy statement of the Company to be
filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger (the "Company Proxy
Statement") will, when filed, and at any time that it is amended or
supplemented, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the 1934 Act. At the time the Company Proxy Statement
is first mailed to shareholders of the Company, and at the time such
shareholders vote on adoption of this Agreement and at the Effective Time, the
Company Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended through each such date, if
applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this Section 4.09
will not apply to statements or omissions included in the Company Proxy
Statement based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by Parent
specifically for use therein.



 

15 Section 4.10. _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the Company Balance Sheet
Date, the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in

any of its Subsidiaries or (2) any Contract with any Key Personnel or any

(v) any change in financial accounting methods, principles or practices by the
Company materially affecting its assets, liabilities or businesses, except
insofar as may have been required by a change in GAAP.



 

16 Section 4.11. _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. There are no material
liabilities or obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any
kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined,
determinable or otherwise, and there is no existing condition, situation or
set of circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in such a
liability or obligation, other than:

(a) liabilities or obligations provided for in the Company Balance Sheet or
disclosed in the notes thereto or in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to
the date hereof, and

(b) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices since the Company Balance Sheet.

Section 4.12. _Material Contracts_. As of the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, and none of their
respective properties or other assets is subject to, any Company Material
Contract, other than those Contracts that are filed as exhibits to the

is in full force and effect, and none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto is
in default or breach in any material respect under the terms thereof, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no event or circumstance has occurred that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute any event of default
thereunder. The Company is not party to, or bound by, any Contract which
restricts or purports to restrict the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
ability to compete in any line of business, geographic area or customer
segment or to sell any specified products.

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has in effect
all approvals, authorizations, certificates, filings, franchises, licenses,
notices and permits of or with all Governmental Authorities (collectively,
"Permits") necessary for it to own, lease or operate its properties and other
assets and to carry on its business and operations as currently conducted,
except for such authorizations, certificates, filings, franchises, licenses,
notices, permits and approvals the failure of which to hold do not have, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Since June 30, 2006, there has
occurred no material default under, or material violation of, any such Permit
and, to the knowledge of the Company, the consummation of the Merger would not
cause the revocation or cancellation of any material Permit. No
representation or warranty is made in this Section 4.13 with respect to
Environmental Laws, which are covered in Section 4.15 hereof, or ERISA
matters, which are covered in Section 4.18 hereof.

fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company.

the Company, threatened against or affecting, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any present or former officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Person for whom the Company or any
Subsidiary may be liable or any of their respective properties before any
court or arbitrator or before or by any Governmental Authority, that, if
determined or resolved adversely in accordance with the plaintiffs demands,
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or would reasonably be expected to
result in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurring liability in excess
of $500,000. Since January 1, 2004, there has not been any action, suit
investigation or proceeding against or affecting the Company that has had a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or resulted in the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries incurring liability in excess of $500,000.

respective businesses and the ownership and/or operation of each property
leased, owned or operated by it (collectively, "Environmental Permits")
except for such permits, consents, licenses and other authorizations the
failure of which to hold would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, (i) a material adverse effect on
the operations of any Company Facility (a "Facility MAE") or (ii) a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, and all Environmental Permits are in good
standing except for such Environmental Permits, whose lack of good standing
would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Facility MAE or a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and
there has been no change in the facts or circumstances reported or assumed in
the applications for or the granting of the Environmental Permits except for
such changes which would not have or reasonably be expected to have,

Section 4.16. _Intellectual Property._

(a) Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list of (i) all registered Owned Intellectual Property and (ii)
all material unregistered trademarks of the Owned Intellectual Property. The
Intellectual Property set forth on Section 4.16(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule is all the registered Owned Intellectual Property
necessary to conduct the business of the Company as presently conducted.

(b) All Owned Intellectual Property is valid, subsisting and enforceable
except, with respect to unregistered Owned Intellectual Property, as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No Owned Intellectual Property is
subject to any outstanding order, judgment or decree adversely affecting the
use thereof or rights thereto (with the exception of official actions of the
United States Patent and Trademark Office, but including reexamination,
cancellation, interference, and reissue proceedings by such Office). The
Company and its Subsidiaries collectively are the exclusive owner of all Owned
Intellectual Property free of any Lien or license. No registered Owned
Intellectual Property has lapsed, expired or been abandoned or cancelled, or
is subject to any pending, or to the knowledge of the Company threatened,
opposition, cancellation, interference, domain name dispute, reexamination,
reissue, or other proceeding, and no such item,  



 

19  requires within six months immediately following the date of this Agreement
that any material action be taken to maintain or preserve such item, except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has not
undertaken or omitted to undertake any act, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no circumstances or grounds exist, that would invalidate, in whole
or in part, the enforceability or scope of any registered Owned Intellectual
Property used in the conduct of its business or otherwise impair the ability
of the Company to exploit its Owned Intellectual Property in the conduct of
its business, except for office actions of the United States Patent and
Trademark Office.

(c) The conduct of the business by the Company and its Subsidiaries has not
infringed and does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property rights of any third Person, except for any such
infringement, misappropriation or violation that does not have, and is not
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. With the exception of office actions of the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (but including
reexamination, cancellation, interference, and reissue proceedings by such
Office), to the knowledge of the Company there is no claim asserted,
threatened or any basis for threatening, against the Company or any indemnitee
of the Company concerning the ownership, validity, registerability,
enforceability, infringement, use or licensed right to use any Owned
Intellectual Property or Licensed-In Intellectual Property.

is valid, subsisting and enforceable and (ii) no Licensed-In Intellectual
Property is subject to any outstanding order, judgment or decree adversely
affecting the Companys use thereof or its rights thereto. Section 4.16(d) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule is an accurate and complete listing of all
Contracts pursuant to which the Company exploits any Licensed-In Intellectual
Property and represents all Licensed-In Intellectual Property as is necessary
to conduct the Business. Each Contract specified in Section 4.16(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in
full force and effect and the Company is not in breach thereof and no
circumstances or grounds exist that would give rise to claim of breach or
rescission, termination, revision or amendment of any of the Contracts
specified in Section 4.16(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(e) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not alter, impair, diminish or result in
the loss of any rights or interests of the Company in any Owned Intellectual
Property or Licensed-In Intellectual Property.

(f) All patents required to be listed in Section 4.16 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule that are owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have been duly registered and/or filed in all material respects
with or issued by each appropriate Governmental Authority, and all necessary
maintenance fees have been timely paid in all material respects to continue
all such rights in effect.

disagreements. To the Companys knowledge no union or other  



 

21  entity has attempted to organize or represent the labor force of any of the
employees of the Company (or its Subsidiaries) in the past twenty-four (24)
months immediately prior to the date hereof, with the exception of the
employees currently represented by United Steel Workers of America, Local 604
at the Buckhannon, West Virginia facility.

Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or to which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is party thereto or obligated to contribute
thereunder for current or former employees or directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company (the "Benefit Plans"). True, correct and complete
copies of the following documents, with respect to each Benefit Plan, have

Company: (i) the Benefit Plan and any related trust documents or other
funding arrangements, and amendments thereto (or a written summary description

modifications, if applicable; and (iv) the most recently received IRS
determination letter for each Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section
401 of the Code; and (v) the most recently prepared actuarial report, if
applicable.

(b) No Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, and no circumstances
exist that could result in liability to the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company maintains, is or will be required to provide,
medical or other welfare benefits to employees, directors, former employees,
former directors, or retirees after their termination of employment or
service, other than (i) pursuant to Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at the
sole expense of the participant or (ii) as set forth on Section 4.18(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, except as does not have, and is not reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

(c) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 of the
Code, and each trust maintained pursuant thereto, has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and to the knowledge
of the Company, nothing has occurred or failed to occur with respect to the
operation of any such Benefit Plan that could cause the loss of such
qualification. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries participates
in, or is required to contribute to, a multi-employer plan as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA.

(d) All Benefit Plans have been maintained and administered, in all material
respects, in accordance with their terms and in accordance with
all Applicable Laws, and to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred with respect to the form or operation of the Benefit Plans that would
cause the imposition of any penalty or tax (other  



 

22  than normal employment taxes) under ERISA, the Code or Applicable Laws. All
contributions, payments and premiums required to have been made to or under
any Benefit Plan have been timely and properly made (or otherwise properly
accrued if not yet due). There are no pending or to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened claims, examinations or audits with respect to the Benefit
Plans, any related trusts, any Benefit Plan sponsor or plan administrator, or
any fiduciary of the Benefit Plans, with respect to the operation of such
plans (other than routine benefit claims). For all Benefit Plans subject to
the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States (which are
separately identified in Section 4.17(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule):
(i) if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment, they meet all
requirements for such treatment; and (ii) if they are intended or required to
be funded and/or book-reserved, they are fully funded and/or book-reserved, as
appropriate and in accordance with GAAP, based upon reasonable actuarial
assumptions.

(e) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone of in conjunction with
another event, such as a termination of employment) will (i) result in any
payment becoming due to any current or former director or current or former
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Benefit Plan or
otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Benefit
Plan, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of
any such benefits.

Section 4.19. _Golden Parachute Payments_. No current or former employee or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled to receive any
additional payment from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation by reason of the excise tax required by Section 4999(a)
of the Code being imposed on such person by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No amount paid or benefit provided by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will
be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code. No employee remuneration paid by the Company will cause a loss of
deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code.

Section 4.20.  _Taxes._ Except as does not have, and is not reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company: (i) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have prepared in

(ii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have paid or caused to be paid
all Taxes that are required to be paid in respect of such Tax Returns and the

party; and (iii) all deficiencies asserted in writing or assessments made as a
result of any examinations or other audits by federal, state, local or
foreign taxing authorities have been paid in full, settled, or adequately
provided for in the financial statements contained in the Company SEC
Documents filed on or prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by and tax sharing
agreement or tax indemnity  



 

23  agreement (other than an agreement in which the Company and one or more if
its Subsidiaries are the sole parties). Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock qualifying for a tax-free
treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has participated in a "listed transaction" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.6011-4(b)(2). For purposes of this

assessments of any nature whatsoever, together with all interest, penalties
and additions imposed with respect to such amounts, and (ii) the term "Tax
Return" means all returns and reports required to be filed with, or supplied
to, any federal, state, local or foreign tax authority with respect to
Taxes.

its Subsidiaries has, and at the Effective Time, will have (i) good and
marketable title (subject only to Permitted Exceptions and the matters
described on Section 4.21(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) to all of its
owned real properties, or (ii) valid and subsisting leasehold or sublease
interests or similar contract rights under valid agreements relating to all
of its leased properties and other tangible assets. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with the terms of all
leases or subleases to which it is a party, and all leases to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and under which it is in
occupancy are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice of any event or occurrence that has
resulted or could reasonably result (with or without the giving of notice,
the lapse of time or both) in an event of default with respect to any lease or
sublease to which it is a party. The consummation of the Merger shall not
require the consent of any party to any of the leases or subleases to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are a party. "Permitted Exceptions"
means (a) liens for taxes or assessments not yet due and payable or being
contested in good faith or (b) mechanics, materialmens or other liens or

the Insurance Policies in full force and effect. With respect to each
Insurance  



 

24  Policy: (i) the policy is in full force and effect in all material respects;
(ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the knowledge of
the Company any other party to the policy, is in material breach or default

constitute such a material breach or default, or permit termination,
modification, or acceleration, under the policy; (iii) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has been refused any coverage or rejected any material
claim under any such insurance policy and (iv) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received notice of default under any Insurance Policy, or
notice of any pending or threatened termination or cancellation, coverage
limitation or reduction or premium increase with respect to any Insurance
Policy.

Section 4.24. _Foreign Corrupt Practices Act_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (or similar laws outside the United States). Neither the
Company nor its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or agents, has, directly or indirectly, (i) made any payment,

lawful under the laws of the United States, any foreign country or any
jurisdiction within the United States or any foreign country. There have been
no false or fictitious entries made in the books or records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries relating to any such illegal payment or secret or
unrecorded fund. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents, has been or is the
subject of any investigation by any Governmental Authority in connection with
any such payment, provision of services or contribution.

Section 4.25. _Finders  Fees_. Except for Morgan Joseph and Co. Inc. (solely
pursuant to the Morgan Joseph and Co. Inc. engagement letter) and Rothschild
Inc. (solely pursuant to the Rothschild Inc. engagement letter), the fees and

25 Section 4.27. _Antitakeover Statutes_. Assuming neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary, nor any Person of which Parent or Merger Subsidiary is an
"affiliate" or an "associate" (within the meaning of Section 302A.011 of

that neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary, nor any Person of which Parent or
Merger Subsidiary is an "affiliate" or an "associate" (within the meaning of
Section 302A.011 of Minnesota Law), has beneficial ownership under Minnesota
Law of any voting power of outstanding shares of the Company other than as
may deem to occur solely by virtue of the Voting Agreement, dated as of the
date hereof, between Parent and Pirate Capital, LLC (the "Voting Agreement"),
no "business combination," "control share acquisition," "fair price," or
other antitakeover law enacted under Minnesota law, any other U.S. state law
or federal laws prohibit or impede this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Companys Board of Directors and
the Strategic Committee, each at a meeting duly called and held, have approved
the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
such approvals are sufficient so that Section 302A.673 of Minnesota Law will
not prohibit or impede the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, assuming that neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary, nor any Person of which Parent or Merger Subsidiary is an
"affiliate" or an "associate" (within the meaning of Section 302A.011 of

power of outstanding shares of the Company other than as may deem to occur

Customers has advised the Company in writing that it intends to reduce its
purchases from, or cease to do business with, or substantially reduce or

31 Section 6.02. _Proxy Material;_ _Shareholder Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Company
and Parent shall prepare, and Company shall file with the SEC, the
Company Proxy Statement, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto. Each of the Company and Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the SEC staff to confirm
that they have no further comments on the Company Proxy Statement ("SEC
Confirmation"), as promptly as practicable after such filing. Without limiting
any other provision herein, the Company Proxy Statement will contain such
information and disclosure reasonably requested by either the Company or
Parent so that the Company Proxy Statement conforms in form and substance to
the requirements of the 1934 Act. The Company Proxy Statement shall contain a
copy of the Fairness Opinion. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
holders of Company Stock as promptly as practicable after the Company
has obtained SEC Confirmation.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of the
receipt of any comments, whether written or oral, from the SEC or its staff
and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to
the Company Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply the
other with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives or Parent or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Company Proxy
Statement. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and provide
to each other all information necessary in order to prepare the Company Proxy
Statement as expeditiously as practicable. Parent and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Company Proxy
Statement (including by participating in any discussions or meetings with the
SEC) each time before the Company Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereto)
is filed with the SEC, and reasonable and good faith consideration shall be
given to any comments made by Parent and its counsel.

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall occur (i) any event
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to
other information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Company Proxy
Statement, or (ii) any event with respect to Parent, or with respect to
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Company Proxy Statement,
in either case, which event is required to be described in an amendment of or
a supplement to the Company Proxy Statement, such event shall be so described,
and such amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed by the Company with
the SEC and, as required by Applicable Law, disseminated by the Company to
shareholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Company Proxy
Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon in accordance with
clause (b) above.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date it receives SEC
Confirmation, the Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of the Company shareholders (the "Company Shareholder Meeting") for
the purpose of seeking the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company Proxy
Statement shall contain (i) the Company Board Recommendation to the Company
shareholders that they give the Company Shareholder Approval and (ii) the
determination of the Board of  



 

32  Directors of the Company that the Merger is advisable and in the best
interests of the Company shareholders, except, in each case, to the extent
that the Board of Directors shall have withdrawn or modified its
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger as permitted by Section 6.04.

Section 6.03. _Access to Information_.

(a) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, from the date hereof until
the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) afford to Parent, and to Parents
officers, employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors, financing sources
(and their advisors) and other authorized representatives full access to the
offices, properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives (A) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by
it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws and (B) such financial and operating data and other
information as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct the
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent
in its investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any investigation
pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The foregoing will not require the Company to permit any
inspection or disclosure of any information that would result in the
disclosure of confidential information of any Person in violation of any
confidentiality obligation of the Company to such Person (provided that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to request that such Person
grant such access or disclosure to Parent and the Company shall nonetheless
otherwise give Parent a general description of the subject matter of the
agreement) or require disclosure of any material concerning on
any Acquisition Proposal made before the date of this Agreement by any
Person, or disclosure of any report from the Companys financial advisors,
counsel, management or other representative regarding the Parent. Without
limiting the foregoing, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) reasonably cooperate with
Parent in connection with Parent securing financing to consummate the Merger,
including, without limitation, cooperating with the Parent in obtaining
appraisals of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, sending notices
to reflect the change of control, obtaining reasonable access to the Companys
accountants and their work papers, making employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries reasonably available, providing all financial information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, and permitting Parent and its accountants reasonable access to the
Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, the Company shall deliver
estimated and reasonably detailed monthly financial results and statements to
Parent as promptly as practicable following each of their preparation at the
end of each fiscal month. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give to
Parent or its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective
Time in any unlawful manner.

(b) Except for disclosures and uses expressly permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement dated as of October 11, 2006, with
addendums executed on or  



 

33  about November 21, 2006 and December 14, 2006, and as amended on the date
hereof, between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"),
Parent shall hold in confidence and use, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors, financing sources (and their advisors) and
other authorized representatives to hold in confidence and use, all
information received from the Company, directly or indirectly, in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) No information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder.

Section 6.04. _Acquisition Proposals._ (a) The Company shall not, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, and shall cause each of the foregoing
Persons respective directors, officers, management personnel, Affiliates,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, and other
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") retained by it or any of
its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed
to, or which could reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public
information relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) amend or modify in
any material respect, or terminate or waive any material right or benefit
under, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement with any Person
(whether or not a Company Material Contract). Without limiting the foregoing,
it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Subsidiary of the Company and/or any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 6.04(a)
by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall cause each of their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with
any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response to a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
reasonably determines (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor of reputation comparable to those used by the Company in connection
with entering into this Agreement) constitutes or would reasonably likely lead
to a Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a
breach of this Section 6.04(a), the Company may, subject to compliance with
Section 6.04(c), (A) furnish non-public information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
(and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
and standstill agreement, provided that all such information has previously
been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with
the time it is provided to such Person, and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

The term "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to (whether
in a single  



 

34  transaction or series of related transactions): (i) any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase by such Person or "group" (within the meaning of
Section13(d) of the Exchange Act) of (A) assets (including equity securities
of any Subsidiary of the Company) or businesses that constitute 20% or more of
the revenues, net income, or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (B) 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or "group"
(within the meaning of Section13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning
20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share
exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which any Person or "group" (within the meaning of
Section13(d) of the Exchange Act) or the shareholders of such Person would
own 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of any resulting parent company of the Company, or (iv) any
other transaction the consummation of which would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under
this Agreement in any material respect or materially delay consummating the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The term "Superior Proposal" means an Acquisition Proposal which did not
result from a breach of this Section 6.04(a), and which (i) the Companys
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal,
if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and if consummated,
would result in a more favorable transaction to the shareholders of the
Company from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the financial and other
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Acquisition
Proposal or otherwise)).

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company, nor any committee thereof,
shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent
(including, without limitation, changing its recommendation to express no
opinion or to take a "neutral" position), or publicly propose to withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent (including, without limitation, changing
its recommendation to express no opinion or to take a "neutral" position),
the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any such
committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) adopt or recommend or express no
opinion or take any "neutral" position with respect to, or propose publicly to
adopt or recommend or express no opinion or take any "neutral" position with
respect to, any Acquisition Proposal (any and all actions described in any
one or more subclauses of this Section 6.04(b)(i) or 6.04(b)(ii) being
referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"). Except as provided
in Section 6.04(f), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or
recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in  



 

35  principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract
constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal (other than
a confidentiality and standstill agreement referred to in Section 6.04(a)) (an
"Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and subject to the Board of
Directors and the Companys compliance with this Section 6.04, the Board of
Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.04(f);
provided, however, that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its
right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section
6.04(f) until after the third business day following Parents receipt of
written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") from the Company advising
Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action
and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board
of Directors (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new three (3) business day
period shall commence). In determining whether to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take into
account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.04(a)
and (b), the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or
offer that is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal after the
date hereof, which notice shall include the identity of the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, proposal or offer and the
material terms and conditions thereof, and will keep Parent promptly and
reasonably apprised of any related material developments, discussions and
negotiations related thereto and provide to Parent as soon as practicable
after receipt or delivery thereof of copies of any and all correspondence and
other written material sent or provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives from any Person that
relates to the terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal and any and all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided by (or on behalf
of) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives in response thereto or otherwise in connection
therewith.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after
receipt of advice from its outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or applicable Law, _provided_
that this Section 6.04(d) will not affect the obligations of the Company and
its Board of Directors under Sections 6.04(a) and 6.04(b); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that (x) any such disclosure made pursuant to this Section
6.04(d) (other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange  



 

36  Act) shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change so
long as the Board of Directors of the Company expressly reaffirms in
such disclosure the Company Board Recommendation and does not recommend or
express no opinion or take a "neutral" position with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and (y) the Company shall provide Parent with no less
than one Business Day notice of such disclosure prior to any such disclosure.

(e) For a period of not less than three (3) business days after
Parents receipt from the Company of an initial Notice of Superior Proposal
in respect of a Superior Proposal made by any Person, the Company shall, if
requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent to revise this
Agreement such that the Acquisition Proposal constituting a Superior Proposal
shall no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

(f) In response to the receipt by the Company of a Superior Proposal that has
not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after the
Companys compliance with the last paragraph of Section 6.02(b) and with
Section 6.02(e), the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(i) and enter into an agreement with a third party with
respect to such Superior Proposal, if (and only if) each of the following
conditions are met:

(i) the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained by such
time; 

(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith,
following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light
of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to result
in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its shareholders under Applicable
Law; and

(iii) at or prior to terminating this Agreement and/or entering into an
agreement reflecting such Superior Proposal, the Company shall have paid any
amounts due pursuant to Section 11.04 in accordance with the terms and at the
times specified therein.

(g) In the event that a third party has made an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall, at the request of Parent, promptly (and in any
event within 48 hours) make a public announcement of its then current
recommendation by the Companys Board of Directors or any committee thereof of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 6.05. _Notification_.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article X and the Effective Time, the Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that any representation
or warranty made by it in  



 

37  this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or
of any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company
set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and provided
further, that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to any information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.05(a).

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article X and the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its best efforts to give prompt notice to Parent of (i) any notice
or other communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, of which the Company
has knowledge alleging any material breach of or material default under any
Company Material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or (ii) any notice or other communication received by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries from any third party, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, of which the Company has knowledge
alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Merger); provided, however, that no such notification shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth
herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or the
remedies available to the parties hereunder; and provided further, that the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any
information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.05(b).

(c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any litigation commenced after
the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors by any
shareholders of the Company (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company)
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such
litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the
Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such litigation and shall
consider Parents views with respect to such litigation and shall not settle
any such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide
any notice or information to Parent the provision of which the Company
in good faith determines may adversely affect the Companys or any other
Persons attorney-client or other privilege with respect to such information.

Section 6.06. _Consents._ Except as set forth in Section 6.06 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall (i) use its best efforts to obtain the
consents set forth in Section 4.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
(ii) obtain the consents set forth in Section 4.06 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, other than consents which the failure to obtain does not have, and
is not reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Facility MAE or a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  



 

38  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.01, the
Company may make payments or amend the terms of each agreement for which
consent is so required subject to the consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

limitation, the Companys Form 10-Ks and Form 10-Qs.

efforts to obtain true, correct and complete pay-off letters with respect to

ARTICLE 7

COVENANTS OF PARENT

Section 7.01. _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary._ Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

Section 7.02. _Retention of Shares;_ Voting of Shares at Shareholders
Meeting. Other than as contemplated herein, neither the Parent or any of its
Affiliates have any intention of disposing any shares of Company Stock owned
by any of them as of the date hereof. Parent will, and will cause its
Affiliates, to vote all shares of Company Stock owned by each of them in favor
of adopting this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, at the Company Shareholders Meeting.

Section 7.03. _Employee Benefits._ (a) Parent agrees that it shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor each Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement in
accordance with its terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time,
subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such
terms. For a period from the Effective Time through at least one year
from Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
those individuals who as of the Effective Time were employees (other than
employees subject to collective bargaining agreements) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Affected Employees") compensation and benefits that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Affected Employees
immediately before the Effective Time or those provided by Parent to its
similarly situated employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein shall obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates to maintain any particular Benefit Plan or retain the
employment of any Affected Employee. 

(b) Each Affected Employee shall receive credit for his or her service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors) before
the Effective Time under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) providing benefits to
any Affected Employees after the Effective Time (the "New Plans") for
purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder to the  



 

39  same extent as such Affected Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any comparable Benefit Plans (except to
the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits). In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) at the
Effective Time, each Affected Employee immediately shall be eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable
Benefit Plans in which such Affected Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, drug and/or vision
benefits to any Affected Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions of such New Plan to be waived for such Affected Employee
and his or her covered dependents to the extent such pre-existing condition
exclusions were inapplicable to or had been satisfied by such Affected
Employee and his or her covered dependants immediately prior to the Effective
Time under the relevant Old Plan; and (iii) each Affected Employee and their
eligible dependents shall receive credit for the dollar amount of expenses
incurred by such Affected Employee and eligible dependants under the Old Plan
for the calendar year in which the Effective Time or the commencement of
participation in the New Plan occurs for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for such year under the New Plan.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing herein expressed
or implied shall confer upon any current or former employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or upon any representative of any such Person, or upon
any collective bargaining agent, any rights or remedies, including any third
party beneficiary rights or any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

Section 7.04. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) The
indemnification, advancement and exculpation provisions of the Companys
articles of incorporation, the Companys bylaws and any indemnification
agreements by and among the Company and its directors and officers (a
complete and accurate copy of which has been delivered to Parent), as in
effect at the Effective Time shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at the
Effective Time were directors, officers or employees of the Company.

(b) The Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain, the Companys and its Subsidiaries
existing directors and officers liability insurance policies ("DandO
Insurance") (a complete and accurate copy of which has been delivered to
Parent) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
covering each Person covered as of the Effective Time by the Companys and its
Subsidiaries DandO Insurance policy (each such Person, an "Indemnified Party")
on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of
such policy in effect on the date hereof for a period of six years after the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 250%
of the current annual premium paid by the  



 

40  Company for such insurance (such 250% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium");
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
the Maximum Annual Premium. In addition, the Company may and, at
Parents request, the Company will, purchase a six-year "tail" / "extended
reporting period" prepaid policy prior to the Effective Time on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the existing
DandO Insurance maintained by the Company; provided, that the amount paid by
the Company shall not exceed six times the Maximum Annual Premium. If such
"tail" / "extended reporting period" prepaid policies have been obtained by
the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in
full force and effect, and continue to honor the respective obligations
thereunder.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 7.04 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives. Upon written
request by such Indemnified Parties or their legal representatives, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide copies and proof of purchase of such DandO
Insurance policies, including any "tail" / "extended reporting period"
insurance coverage.

ARTICLE 8

COVENANTS OF PARENT, MERGER SUBSIDIARY AND THE COMPANY

Section 8.01. _Reasonable Best Efforts._ (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company, Merger Subsidiary and Parent shall
use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under Applicable Law to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner possible, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable
with any Governmental Authority or other third party all documentation to
effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents, (ii) obtaining
and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any
Governmental Authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iii) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to
be satisfied as promptly as practicable.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a notification and
report form with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") pursuant to
the HSR Act (the "HSR Filing") with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within 20 Business Days of
the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable. The HSR  



 

41  filing shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of
Applicable Law. The Company and Parent shall split equally the HSR Filing fees
and any and all other filing fees that become due and payable under any other
applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or similar law.

(c) The Company and Parent shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, notifications and any other
material actions pursuant to this Section 8.01, subject to Applicable Law, by
permitting counsel for the other party to review in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed
material written communication to any Governmental Authority and by providing
counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and submissions made
by such party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors)
with any Governmental Authority and any other information supplied by such
party and such partys Affiliates to a Governmental Authority or received
from such a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that material may be
redacted (x) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (y) as
necessary to address good faith legal privilege or confidentiality concerns.
Except as otherwise required by law, neither party shall file any such
document or take such action if the other party has reasonably objected (and
not withdrawn its objection) to the filing of such document or the taking of
such action on the grounds that such filing or action would reasonably be
expected to either (i) prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
(ii) cause a condition set forth in Article IX to not be satisfied in a timely
manner. Neither party shall consent to any voluntary extension of any
statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld).

(d) Each of the Company and Parent will promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any material communication from the FTC, the DOJ or any
other Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. If the Company or Parent (or any of their respective
Affiliates) receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any such Governmental Authority that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. Each of the Company and Parent will make all
reasonable efforts not to participate, or to permit their Affiliates to
participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement unless it so consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, shall give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate. Each party will advise the
other party promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral
or written) which the first party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC,
the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

42 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Parent and its Subsidiaries are not required to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) become
subject to, consent or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to,
any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to
sell, to hold separate (by establishing a trust or otherwise) or otherwise
dispose of, divest or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets or business of the Company, Parent, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or (ii) enter into any settlement, undertaking,
consent decree, stipulation, or agreement with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) The Company and its Board of Directors shall (i) use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that no state takeover law or similar law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover law
or similar law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and without limiting
Parents rights hereunder, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such law on this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, unless this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, in no event shall the
Minnesota Anti-Takeover Approval be withdrawn, revoked or modified by the
Board of Directors of the Company or the Strategic Committee. For purposes of
this Agreement, the "Minnesota Anti-Takeover Approval" shall mean the actions
taken by the Companys Board of Directors and the Strategic Committee referred
to in Section 4.27 hereof causing Section 302A.673 of Minnesota Law not to
prohibit this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 8.02. _Public Announcements._ Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release, making any other public
statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors
or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing
agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or association,
shall not issue any such press release, make any such other public statement
or schedule any such press conference or conference call before such
consultation. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in
the form heretofore agreed by the parties.

Section 8.03. _Further Assurances._

(a) At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the
Company or Merger Subsidiary, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.



 

43 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take such steps
as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of
any securities of the Company (including stock options and other derivative
securities) pursuant to the Merger by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
1934 Act in accordance with the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued
by the SEC regarding such matters.

condition is incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; or



 

46 (d) by the Company, if:

representations and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or
other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time;
provided that nothing herein shall release any party from liability for bad
faith, intentional misconduct or fraud. This Section 11.02 shall not limit
any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates
performance after the Effective Time, including, without limitation, the
agreements contained in Section 7.04.

Section 11.03. _Amendments and Waivers._ (a) Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that, after the Company
Shareholder Approval without their further approval, no such amendment or
waiver shall reduce the amount or change the kind of consideration to be
received in exchange for the shares of Company Stock.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 11.04. _Expenses._ (a) Except as provided in this Section 11.04 and
Section 8.01(b), all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.

(b) In the event that (I) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 10.01(d)(i) or by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i), (II) (A)
after the date of this Agreement but prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal (as defined below)
shall have been made to the Company or directly to the shareholders of the
Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known, disclosed or
proposed or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or
not conditional) to make an Alternative Acquisition Proposal, (B) thereafter
this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i) and (C) within twelve (12) months after such termination,
the Company enters into a definitive Contract (which is thereafter
consummated) to consummate, or consummates the transactions contemplated by
any Alternative Acquisition Proposal, (III) (A) this Agreement is terminated
by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(ii) and (B) within twelve (12) months
after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive Contract (which
is thereafter consummated) to consummate, or consummates the transactions
contemplated by any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (IV) (A)
this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(iii) and (B) within six (6) months after such  



 

49  termination, the Company enters into a definitive Contract (which is
thereafter consummated) to consummate, or consummates the transactions
contemplated by any Alternative Acquisition Proposal, then, in the case of
the occurrence of any one or more of the events described in Section
11.04(b)(I), (II), (III) and (IV), the Company shall pay Parent an amount
equal to (1) $3% of the aggregate Merger Consideration (the "Termination
Fee") and (2) the Parent Expenses (as defined below) (less any Parent Expenses
that may have been previously paid) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds no later than the first business day following (x) in the case of a
payment required by clause (I) above, the date of termination of this
Agreement and (y) in the case of a termination required by clause (II) or
(III) or (IV) above, the date of the consummation of such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay Parent Expenses, pursuant to this Section 11.04(b), in excess
of $2,500,000, and provided, further, that if Section 6.04 hereof requires
payment prior to termination pursuant to its terms, then Section 6.04 shall
control with respect to when the payment hereunder is due to Parent. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall more than one Termination Fee be
payable under this Agreement. For purposes hereof, the term "Alternative
Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to (whether in a
single transaction or series of related transactions): (i) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase by such Person or "group" (within the meaning
of Section13(d) of the Exchange Act) of (A) assets (including equity
securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) or businesses that constitute 20%
or more of the revenues, net income, or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (B) 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or "group"
(within the meaning of Section13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning
20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iii) or any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share
exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which any Person or "group" (within the meaning of
Section13(d) of the Exchange Act) or the shareholders of such Person would own
20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of any resulting parent company of the Company in each case,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

50 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(c)(ii), then the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the sum
of Parent Expenses (not to exceed $2,500,000 in the aggregate) for which
Parent has not theretofore been reimbursed by the Company in cash by wire
transfer in immediately available funds and, other than as provided in Section
11.04(b), the Company shall have no further liability with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to Parent (provided that
nothing herein shall release any party from liability for bad faith,
intentional misconduct or fraud), such payment to be made following such
termination within two business days following delivery to the Company of
notice of demand for such payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Parent Expenses" means, with respect to a party hereto, all reasonable
documented out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation,
all reasonable fees and expenses of debt financing sources (including those
who are parties to any financing commitments), counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto) incurred by a
party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the sale process,
including the authorization, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including Parents
financing.

(d) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in this Section 11.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company and Parent
would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails
to pay when due the amount payable pursuant to this Section 11.04, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit, the Company shall pay
to Parent the costs and expenses of Parent (including attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amount of the Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses (as the case may be),
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of receipt
by Parent of immediately available funds in such amount at the prime rate
as reported from time to time by the Wall Street Journal, in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made.

Section 11.05. _ Disclosure Schedule References._ The parties hereto agree
that any reference in a particular Section of either the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an
exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant
party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement.

Section 11.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._ (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 7.04,
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.04, no provision of
this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except  



 

51  that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part,
to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

Section 11.07. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or any federal court within the District of Delaware, and each of the
parties (i) hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum and (ii) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in any other court. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

Section 11.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.09.

Section 11.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).



 

52 Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. 

Section 11.12. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
respective terms and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or

Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of such agreements in any federal court located in the State of
Minnesota or any Minnesota state court, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.
