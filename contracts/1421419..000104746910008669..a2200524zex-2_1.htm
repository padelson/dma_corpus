AGREEMENT 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 
THE OFFER 

  

 Section 1.1 _ The Offer._ 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article VIII, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event no later than the 10th calendar day after the date hereof, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer. In the Offer, each Share accepted by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer shall be exchanged for the right to receive, at the election of the holder: (i) $20.80 in cash, without interest (such amount for each Share, the " _Cash Consideration_ "), or (ii) such number of shares of common stock of the Parent, par value $0.10 (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) $20.80 by (B) the Average Trading Price (such quotient representing shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest thousandth, with 0.XXX5 or greater rounded up to the nearest thousandth of a share, for each Share, the " _Stock Consideration_ "), in each case subject to proration as set forth in Section 1.1(d) and subject to the other provisions of this Section 1.1. 

   

 (b) The obligations of Merger Sub, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub, to accept for payment and pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to (i) the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and (ii) the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of the other conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto (such conditions, together with the Minimum Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ ") and the terms and conditions hereof. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to waive any Offer Condition or to modify the terms or conditions of the Offer consistent with the terms of the terms of this Agreement, except that, without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, except pursuant to Section 6.2(b) to the extent set forth below, (i) reduce the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer (other than by adding consideration, pursuant to Section 1.1(d) through Section 1.1(h) or pursuant to Section 6.2(b)), (iii) reduce the number of Shares to be purchased by Merger Sub in the Offer, (iv) waive or amend the Minimum Condition or any of the conditions in clauses (b) or (c) of _Exhibit A_, (v) add to the Offer Conditions or impose any other conditions to the Offer, (vi) extend the expiration of the Offer except as required or permitted by Section 1.1(i), (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition or any term of the Offer set forth in this Agreement in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares or (viii) abandon or terminate the Offer, except as provided in Article VIII hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may amend the Offer without violation of the foregoing limitations and without the prior written consent of the Company in connection with its "match" right set forth in Section 6.2(b) in order to cause the Offer to comply with its bona fide proposal(s) pursuant to that section, _provided_ that such 

        
  

"match" right-to-adjust shall not apply to Section 1.1(b)(iv) and shall apply
to Section 1.1(b)(vii) only to the extent that the revised Offer, taken as a
whole (as opposed to any individual term), has not been revised in a manner
adverse to the holders of Shares.

  

 (c) Subject to Sections 1.1(d), (e) and (f), each holder of Shares shall be entitled to elect (i) the number of Shares which such holder desires to exchange for the right to receive the Cash Consideration (a " _Cash Election_ "), and (ii) the number of Shares which such holder desires to exchange for the right to receive Stock Consideration (a " _Parent Stock Election_ "). Any Cash Election or Parent Stock Election shall be referred to herein as an " _Election_ ," and shall be made on a form mutually agreed by Merger Sub and the Company for that purpose (a " _Form of Election_ "), included as part of the letter of election and transmittal accompanying the Offer. Holders of record who hold Shares as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may submit multiple Forms of Election on behalf of their respective beneficial holders, but only one such Form of Election for each such beneficial holder. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 

  

  

 (i) The maximum aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to the Offer shall be (x) $20.80 multiplied by (y) 50% of the total number of Shares outstanding that are tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer (such amount, or such greater amount specified in accordance with Section 1.1(f) being referred to as the " _Maximum Cash Consideration_ "); and 

  

 (ii) The maximum aggregate amount of Stock Consideration issuable pursuant to the Offer shall be (x) the Stock Consideration multiplied by (y) 50% of the total number of Shares outstanding that are tendered and accepted for exchange pursuant to the Offer (such amount, or any lesser amount specified in accordance with Section 1.1(f) being referred to as the " _Maximum Stock Consideration_ "). 

  

 (iii) If the total number of Cash Elections would require aggregate cash payments in excess of the Maximum Cash Consideration, such Elections shall be subject to proration as follows. For each Cash Election, the number of Shares that shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be (A) the total number of Shares subject to such Cash Election multiplied by (B) the Cash Proration Factor, rounded down to the nearest Share. The " _Cash Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Cash Consideration and (y) the denominator of which shall be the product of the aggregate number of Shares subject to all Cash Elections made by all holders of Shares, multiplied by the Cash Consideration. The Shares subject to such Cash Election that were not converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.1(d) shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. All prorations resulting from this Section 1.1(d) shall be applied on a pro rata basis, such that each Stockholder who tenders Shares subject to a Cash Election bears its proportionate share of the proration, based on the percentage of all Shares subject to Cash Elections tendered by all Stockholders that is reflected by the total Shares subject to a Cash Election tendered by such Stockholder. 

   

 (iv) If the total number of Parent Stock Elections would require the issuance in the aggregate of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock in excess of the Maximum Stock Consideration, such Elections shall be subject to proration as follows. For each Parent Stock Election, the number of Shares that shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration shall be (A) the total number of Shares subject to such Parent Stock Election multiplied by (B) the Parent Stock Proration Factor, rounded down to the nearest Share. The " _Parent Stock Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Stock Consideration and (y) the denominator of which shall be the product of the aggregate number of Shares subject to all Parent Stock Elections made by all holders of Shares, multiplied by the Stock Consideration. The Shares subject to such Parent Stock Election that were not converted into the right to receive the Stock 

  

      

  
  

Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.1(d) shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration. All prorations resulting from
this Section 1.1(d) shall be applied on a pro rata basis, such that each
Stockholder who tenders subject to a Parent Stock Election bears its
proportionate share of the proration, based on the percentage of all Shares
subject to Parent Stock Elections tendered by all Stockholders that is
reflected by the total Shares subject to a Parent Stock Election tendered by
such Stockholder.

  

  

 (e) Each Share tendered but which is not the subject of a valid Election (a " _No Election Share_ ") shall be deemed to be tendered subject to the following Elections: 

  

  

 (i) If the Cash Elections exceed the Maximum Cash Consideration such that proration of Cash Elections occur pursuant to Section 1.1(d)(iii), each No Election Share will be deemed tendered subject to a Parent Stock Election; 

  

 (ii) If the Parent Stock Elections exceed the Maximum Stock Consideration such that proration of Parent Stock Elections occurs pursuant to Section 1.1(d)(iv), each No Election Share will be deemed tendered subject to a Cash Election; and 

  

 (iii) If no proration occurs, each No Election Share will be deemed tendered in part subject to a Cash Election and in part subject to a Parent Stock Election. In such case, (A) 50% of the Shares validly tendered in the Offer, reduced by the number of Shares subject to valid Cash Elections (as adjusted pursuant to Sections 1.1(d)(iii) through 1.1(d)(iv)), shall be deemed to be subject to Cash Elections, and (B) 50% of the Shares validly tendered in the Offer, reduced by the number of Shares subject to valid Stock Elections (as adjusted pursuant to Sections 1.1(d)(iii) through 1.1(d)(iv)), shall be deemed to be subject to Stock Elections (it being understood that the sum of (A) and (B) shall equal the number of No Election Shares), and the related available Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration remaining after taking into account the affirmative Elections of Stockholders will be allocated on a pro rata basis among Stockholders who tendered No Election Shares such that the same percentage of a Stockholder\'s No Election Shares is treated as subject to a Cash Election as is so treated for each other Stockholder of No Election Shares and the same percentage of a Stockholder\'s No Election Shares is treated as subject to a Stock Election as is so treated for each other Stockholder of No Election Shares. 

  

  

 (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Offer exceed the Stock Consideration Cap and accordingly, if the Stock Consideration Cap is less than the " _Maximum Stock Consideration_ " as initially calculated pursuant to Section 1.1(d), then the " _Maximum Stock Consideration_ " as so calculated shall be adjusted and instead shall be equal to the product of (A) 19.9% of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date on which Shares are first accepted for payment under the Offer (the " _Acceptance Date_ ") and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the total number of Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer, by (2) the total number of Shares outstanding as of the Acceptance Date (such product of (A) and (B) also being the " _Stock Consideration Cap_ "). In the event that the Maximum Stock Consideration is decreased pursuant to this Section 1.1(f), then the Shares that would otherwise have received Stock Consideration in exchange for Shares validly tendered in the Offer shall instead receive the Cash Consideration and the " _Maximum Cash Consideration_ " as initially calculated pursuant to Section 1.1(d) shall be increased appropriately to reflect such increased number of Shares receiving Cash Consideration. If an adjustment to the Maximum Stock Consideration and the Maximum Cash Consideration occurs by reason of this Section 1.1(f), such adjustment shall be allocated among all Stockholders who, but for this Section 1.1(f), would receive Stock Consideration, in a manner consistent with the manner in which adjustments may be required pursuant to Sections 1.1(d)(iii) and 1.1(d)(iv). 

        

 (g) In lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be issuable pursuant to the Offer, each holder of Shares who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer will be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such holder\'s respective proportionate interest in the proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent for the Offer, on behalf of all such holders, of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common Stock deemed issued pursuant to the Offer. As soon as practicable following the completion of the Offer, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the former holders of Shares pursuant to the Offer (including fractional shares), over (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to former holders of Shares (excluding fractional shares) (such excess being collectively called the " _Excess Offer Parent Stock_ "). The Exchange Agent, as agent and trustee for the former holders of Shares, shall as promptly as reasonably practicable sell the Excess Offer Parent Stock at the prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "). The sales of the Excess Offer Parent Stock by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent and costs associated with calculating and distributing the respective cash amounts payable to the applicable former holders of Shares, incurred in connection with such sales of Excess Offer Parent Stock. Until the proceeds of such sales have been distributed to the former holders of Shares to whom fractional shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise would have been issued in the Offer, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to former holders of Shares in respect of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall distribute such amounts to such former holders. 

  

 (h) If, between the date of this Agreement and the completion of the Offer, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or the Shares shall have been changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Cash Consideration, the Stock Consideration, the Maximum Cash Consideration, the Maximum Stock Consideration, the Cash Proration Factor and the Parent Stock Proration Factor shall be correspondingly adjusted as appropriate to provide the holders of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 (i) The Offer shall expire on the date that is 20 Business Days after the commencement of the Offer, except as may otherwise be required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause it to (in each case unless Parent has terminated this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII), extend the Offer (i) if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived, for one or more successive periods of up to 20 Business Days per extension until the earlier to occur of (A) the date such Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived or (B) March 1, 2011 (the " _Outside Date_ "), or (ii) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof or the rules of the NYSE or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer or any other applicable Law. In addition, Merger Sub may, at its option, extend the Offer for one extension period not in excess of 10 Business Days (but not later than the Outside Date) in the event that all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived but there shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn a number of Shares (excluding Shares tendered by guaranteed delivery for which the underlying Shares have not been received) that, together with the Shares, if any, then owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, would represent at least 90% of the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis on the date of purchase. 

        

 (j) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of all of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub will irrevocably accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration date thereof (as the same may be extended or required to be extended, in each case in accordance with the terms of Section 1.1). 

  

 (k) Parent shall cause to be provided to Merger Sub all of the funds and Parent Common Stock necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Merger Sub to perform, on a timely basis, all of Merger Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement with respect to consummation of the Offer and the Merger and payment or issuance of consideration contemplated by this Agreement in respect thereof. 

   

 Section 1.2 _ Offer Documents._ As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (including any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Registration Statement_ "). The Registration Statement will include a preliminary prospectus containing the information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the " _Preliminary Prospectus_ "). Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof with the SEC and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to complete the Offer. As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (a) file a Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer, which shall contain or shall incorporate by reference all or part of the Preliminary Prospectus, an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") and forms of the related letter of election and transmittal and form of summary advertisement (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase, the registration statement described below required to be filed pursuant to Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes, and such other documents, together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (b) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly supply Parent and Merger Sub in writing, for inclusion in the Offer Documents, all information concerning the Company required under the Exchange Act to be included in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by them for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and Parent shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent agrees to provide the Company and its counsel any comments, whether written or oral, that Parent may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such responses and Parent shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall timely file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota any registration statement relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement required to be filed pursuant to Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes and shall disseminate to the holders of Shares via the Offer Documents the information set forth in any such registration statement to the extent and within the time period required by Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes. 

        

 Section 1.3 _ Company Actions._ 

  

 (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Company Board described in Section 4.4(b) (as long as no Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred prior to the filing of such Offer Document and provided that in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent and Merger Sub shall file such amendment to the Offer Documents as may be necessary so that any of such Offer Documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading). 

  

 (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of filing by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer Documents, the Company shall file with the SEC and mail to the Stockholders a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") containing, subject to the Company Board\'s right to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.2(b), the recommendation of the Company Board described in Section 4.4(b), and shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the Stockholders (concurrently with and in the same mailing envelope as the Offer Documents) as required by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the Stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. As long as no Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred in accordance with Section 6.2(b) prior to the filing of such Schedule 14D-9 or the applicable amendment thereto, Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 and any such amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such responses and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. 

  

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent promptly to furnish Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels, security position listings, any non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any available listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the most recent practicable date and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such additional available information (including, but not limited to, periodic updates of such information) and such other assistance as Parent, Merger Sub or their agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the Mergers, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence, subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement except as further limited herein, the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Mergers and if this Agreement shall be terminated shall promptly deliver to the Company or order the destruction of the original and all copies of such information. 

  

 Section 1.4 _ Directors._ 

   

 (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the payment by Merger Sub for Shares pursuant to the Offer representing at least such number of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum 

        
  

Condition, and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company Board as is equal to the product of the total number of directors
on the Company Board (including the directors elected pursuant to this
sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent or its Affiliates at such time (including Shares
so accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding
on a fully-diluted basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be
entitled to designate at least a majority of the directors on the Company
Board as long as Parent and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the
Shares of the Company. In furtherance thereof, promptly upon the payment by
Merger Sub for Shares pursuant to the Offer representing at least such number
of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition, the Company shall, upon
request of Parent, promptly take all actions necessary to cause Parent\'s
designees to be so elected or appointed, including, without limitation,
increasing the size of its Board of Directors and/or seeking the resignations
of one or more incumbent directors. At such time, the Company shall, upon
request of Parent, also promptly take all actions necessary to cause
individuals designated by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each
committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body)
of each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body)
of each such board.

  

 (b) The Company\'s obligations to appoint Parent\'s designees to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.4(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.4, including mailing to the Stockholders together with the Schedule 14D-9 the information required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Merger Sub\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board. Parent shall supply to the Company any information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this Section 1.4 are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. 

  

 (c) In the event that Parent\'s designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board pursuant to this Section 1.4 then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Board to maintain at least three directors who are members of the Company Board on the date of this Agreement and who are independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act (the " _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the number of Independent Directors is reduced below three for any reason, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to nominate an individual or individuals to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate three individuals to fill such vacancies who are independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and such individuals shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. The Company and the Company Board shall promptly take all action as may be necessary to comply with their obligations under this Section 1.4(c). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the time, if any, that Parent\'s designees pursuant to this Section 1.4 constitute a majority of the Company Board and prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof, any amendment or termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub or waiver of any of the Company\'s rights hereunder, will require the concurrence of a majority of the Independent Directors (or in the case where there are two or fewer Independent Directors, the concurrence of one Independent Director) if such amendment, termination, extension or waiver would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any holders of Shares other than Parent or Merger Sub. 

        

 Section 1.5 _ The Top-Up Option._ 

   

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable upon the terms and conditions of this Section 1.5, to purchase that number of newly- issued Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares held by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the total Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis and assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares, but excluding from Merger Sub\'s ownership, but not from outstanding Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee). 

   

 (b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once in whole and not in part on or prior to the 10th Business Day after Merger Sub\'s acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer, _provided that_ the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option constitutes at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (excluding from Merger Sub\'s ownership, but not from outstanding Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee) and that Merger Sub shall own, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Top-Up Shares pursuant thereto, one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (excluding from Merger Sub\'s ownership, but not from outstanding Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable (x) for a number of Shares in excess of the number of authorized but unissued and unreserved Shares (including as authorized and unissued Shares, for purposes of this Section 1.5, any Shares held in the treasury of the Company), (y) if the issuance of the Top-Up Shares would require approval of the Stockholders under Rule 5635 of the NASDAQ Stock Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") listing standards and a waiver of or exemption from such requirement is not obtained from NASDAQ, or (z) any other provision of applicable Law or judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares. Except as otherwise provided in Section 1.5(c), the aggregate amount payable to the Company for the Top-Up Shares shall be equal to the product of the number of Top-Up Shares and the Cash Consideration (the " _Top-Up Consideration_ "). The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (c) The Top-Up Consideration shall consist of (i) an amount equal to the par value of the Top-Up Shares, to be paid in cash, and (ii) an amount equal to the balance of the Top-Up Consideration, which may be paid (x) in cash, (y) by issuance of a promissory note (which shall be treated as payment to the extent of the principal amount thereof) with full recourse to Parent or (z) by issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock valued at the Average Trading Price, or any combination of the foregoing, at Merger Sub\'s election. Any such promissory note shall (A) bear interest at the rate per annum equal to the prime rate as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Midwest Edition, on the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note, (B) shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note, (C) may be prepaid without premium or penalty and (D) shall provide that the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest under the promissory note shall immediately become due and payable in the event that (x) Merger Sub fails to make any payment of interest on the promissory note as provided therein and such failure continues for a period of 30 days or (y) Merger Sub files or has filed against it any petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors. 

  

 (d) In the event Merger Sub exercises the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of Shares that will be owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, (ii) the place and 

        
  

time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (which, subject to
applicable Law and any required regulatory approvals, shall be effected as
promptly as practicable and not more than 2 Business Days after date such
notice is delivered to the Company), (iii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that Merger Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up
Option and (iv) the manner in which Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable
exercise price. Such notice shall also include an undertaking signed by Parent
and Merger Sub that, as promptly as practicable following such exercise of
the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, as
promptly as practicable after such exercise and the delivery by the Company
of the Top-Up Shares, consummate the Mergers in accordance with the terms
hereof (subject in the case of the Merger to Article VII and in the case of
the Second Merger to Section 6.13). At the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Shares, Parent or Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company
the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such shares, and
the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or Merger Sub a certificate
representing such shares, which certificate may include any legends required
by applicable securities Laws.

  

 (e) Parent and Merger Sub understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents and warrants that Merger Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. 

  

 (f) Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary or desirable to procure from NASDAQ or any other Governmental Entity any necessary waiver or other exemption from NASDAQ requirements or applicable Law in order to issue the Top-Up Shares without obtaining the approval of the Stockholders. 

  

 (g) The parties agree that any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as a result of the existence or exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Shares, and any effect of the promissory note and Parent Common Stock referred to in Section 1.5(c) above, will not be taken into account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 3.5. 

  

 (h) Except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law, Parent may cause the Company to deliver cash or shares of Parent Common Stock paid upon exercise of the Top-Up Option to the Exchange Agent as part of the Exchange Fund in satisfaction of the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under Section 3.3(a) to deliver a corresponding amount of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, and such amounts shall be included in the Cash Merger Consideration and Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable. 

  

 Section 1.6 _ Short Form Merger._ If, after the consummation of the Offer and any exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub and Parent\'s other Subsidiaries collectively represent at least 90% of the then outstanding Shares, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and Parent and Parent\'s other Subsidiaries shall transfer any Shares they own to Merger Sub to enable Merger Sub to, and the Company shall execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as Parent or Merger Sub may request, in order to cause the Merger to be completed as promptly as reasonably practicable as provided in Section 253 of the DGCL, and otherwise as provided in Article II below. 

      

                                    

   

    
ARTICLE II 
THE MERGER 

   

 Section 2.1 _ The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

  

 Section 2.2 _ Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, on the second Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 1881 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304-1211, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 Section 2.3 _ Effective Time._ Upon the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger or, if applicable, a certificate of ownership and merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of State_ "), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make any and all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such other date or time as Parent and the Company shall agree in writing and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 Section 2.4 _ Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 2.5 _ Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws._ 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated as set forth in _Exhibit B_ and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated to read the same as the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by applicable Law. 

   

 Section 2.6 _ Directors._ The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

ARTICLE III 
EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

  

 Section 3.1 _ Conversion of Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub: 

  

  

 (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive either (i) $20.80 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Merger Consideration_ "), or (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Stock Consideration (the " _Stock Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The aggregate amount of Cash Merger Consideration and Stock Merger Consideration that a Stockholder shall be entitled to pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) shall be determined as follows: (A) 50% of the Shares to be canceled in the Merger by such Stockholder (as adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.1, the " _Cash Merger Shares_ ") shall be deemed converted into the right to receive the Cash Merger Consideration, and (B) 50% of the Shares to be canceled in the Merger by such Stockholder (as adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.1, " _Stock Merger Shares_ ") shall be deemed converted into the right to receive the Stock Merger Consideration, subject to adjustment and proration as provided in this Section 3.1. As of the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 3.3, without interest. 

  

 (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) The maximum aggregate amount of Cash Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger shall be (x) $20.80 multiplied by (y) 50% of the total number of Shares canceled pursuant to the Merger (other than Shares canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b), minus the cash value of Dissenting Shares) (such amount, or any greater amount specified in accordance with Section 3.1(e), the " _Maximum Cash Merger Consideration_ "). For purposes of this Section 3.1, the " _cash value of Dissenting Shares_ " assumes that the fair value, or "cash value," of each Dissenting Share equals the Cash Merger Consideration. The maximum aggregate amount of Stock Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to the Merger shall be (x) the Stock Consideration multiplied by (y) 50% of the total number of Shares canceled pursuant to the Merger (other than Shares canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b)) (such amount, or any lesser amount specified in accordance with Section 3.1(e), the " _Maximum Stock Merger Consideration_ "). 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Offer and issuable pursuant to the Merger and upon exercise or conversion of all convertible securities assumed by Parent in the Merger exceed 19.9% of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Date; and, accordingly, if the Merger Stock Consideration Cap is less than the Maximum Stock Merger Consideration as initially calculated pursuant to 

  

      

  
  

Section 3.1(d), then (i) the " _Maximum Stock Merger Consideration_ " as so
calculated shall be adjusted and instead shall be the amount equal to (A)
19.9% of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Acceptance Date minus (B) the total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock issued pursuant to the Offer (such difference of (A) and (B)
also being the " _Merger Stock Consideration Cap_ "). In the event that the
Maximum Stock Merger Consideration is decreased pursuant to this Section
3.1(e), then the Shares that would otherwise have received Stock Merger
Consideration in the Merger shall instead receive the Cash Merger
Consideration and the " _Maximum Cash Merger Consideration_ " as initially
calculated pursuant to Section 3.1(d) shall be increased appropriately to
reflect such increased number of Shares receiving Cash Merger Consideration.
If an adjustment to the Maximum Stock Merger Consideration and the Maximum
Cash Merger Consideration occurs by reason of this Section 3.1(e), such
adjustment shall be allocated among all Stockholders who, but for this Section
3.1(e), would receive Stock Merger Consideration, in the proportion that the
Shares surrendered by such Stockholder bears to the Shares surrendered by all
Stockholders in the Merger.

  

 (f) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period (excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 3.1(f) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (except the remaining provisions of this Section 3.1(g)), if the product of (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Offer and the Merger in exchange for the Shares and (ii) the Testing Price (as defined below) (such product, the " _Value of Stock Consideration_ ") is less than 40% of the sum of the Value of Stock Consideration and the amount of Non-Stock Consideration (as defined below), then the number of Cash Merger Shares shall be reduced (the number of Shares subject to such reduction, the " _Cash Merger Share Reduction_ "), and the number of Stock Merger Shares shall be increased by the same number of Shares that are subject to the Cash Merger Share Reduction, so as to cause such percentage to be equal to (as close as possible, but not below) 40%. Such adjustment shall increase the Cash Merger Shares and decrease the Stock Merger Shares of each Stockholder in the proportion that the Shares surrendered by such Stockholder bears to the Shares surrendered by all Stockholders in the Merger. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued under this Section 3.1(g) shall be, along with the number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable in connection with the Merger, subject to the Merger Stock Consideration Cap. If the additional Parent Common Stock to be issued under this Section 3.1(g) would cause the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to exceed the Merger Stock Consideration Cap, or if converting up to all Cash Merger Shares to Stock Merger Shares pursuant to this Section 3.1(g) would not cause such 40% threshold to be satisfied, then the adjustments in this Section 3.1(g) shall be inapplicable, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to complete the Second Merger and there shall be deemed to be an " _Inadequate Continuity of Interest_." For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 3.1(g) shall not be applicable, the Value of Stock Consideration need not be tested, and no adjustment shall occur as 

  

      

  
  

a result of this Section 3.1(g), if the Second Merger does not occur as a
result of the provisions hereof. For purposes of this Section 3.1(g):

    

 (i) " _Non-Stock Consideration_ " shall mean (A) any cash consideration paid pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, and (B) any other cash or property (other than shares of Parent Common Stock) that is transferred, paid or distributed by Parent (or any Person related to Parent within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) to holders of Shares in exchange for Shares in connection with the Offer and Merger (including the maximum amount of cash paid and expected by Parent and the Company to be paid on account of Dissenting Shares); 

  

 (ii) " _Testing Price_ " shall be the lowest of the following amounts, as reported on the NYSE: (A) the closing Parent Common Stock trading price on the Valuation Date, (B) the average between the high and low Parent Common Stock trading prices on the Valuation Date, and (C) the volume weighted average of the trading prices of all shares of Parent Common Stock traded on the Valuation Date. 

  

 (iii) " _Valuation Date_ " shall mean the applicable valuation date as counsel for the Company and the Parent mutually agree is appropriate under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(2) for purposes of testing the continuity of interest requirement under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e) with respect to the Mergers. 

   

  

 Section 3.2 _ Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards._ 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") to purchase Shares granted under the AGA Medical Holdings, Inc. 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, and the AGA Medical Holdings, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Option as soon as practicable following the Effective Time by a special payroll payment an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Cash Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option; _provided_ , that if the exercise price per Share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Cash Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof; _provided further_ that Parent may, in its sole discretion, cause the Exchange Agent, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, to make the payments described in this Section 3.2(a) rather than the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) Each restricted stock unit with respect to Shares (each, an " _RSU_ ") granted under a Company Stock Plan shall fully vest immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each holder of an RSU shall receive from the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time by a special payroll payment the Cash Merger Consideration with respect to each such RSU at the same time such Cash Merger Consideration is paid to holders of Shares; _provided further_  that Parent may, in its sole discretion, cause the Exchange Agent, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, to make the payments described in this Section 3.2(b) rather than the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required notices (which notices shall have been approved by Parent, in its reasonable discretion) to each holder of Company Stock Options and RSUs setting forth each holder\'s rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plan, stating that such Company Stock Options and RSUs shall be treated in the manner set forth in this Section 3.2. 

   

 (d) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, (i) the Company Stock Plans shall terminate and (ii) no holder of a Company Stock Option or an RSU or any 

        
  

participant in any Company Stock Plan or any other employee incentive or
benefit plan, program or arrangement or any non-employee director plan
maintained by the Company shall have any rights to acquire, or other rights
in respect of, the capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries, except the right to receive the payment
contemplated by Section 3.2(a) or 3.2(b), as applicable, in cancellation and
settlement thereof.

  

 (e) With respect to the AGA Medical Holdings, Inc. 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "), the Company shall not commence any new "Offerings" (as defined in the ESPP) under the ESPP on or after the date of this Agreement. Immediately prior to the date of a "Change of Control" (as defined in the ESPP), the Company shall take all action necessary to terminate the ESPP and to cancel all rights to purchase Common Stock currently outstanding under the Offering in effect at the time of the Change of Control, and the accumulated payroll deductions previously withheld on behalf of employees who elected to participate in such Offering shall be refunded to such employees. In addition, at the Effective Time, each such employee shall receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Cash Merger Consideration over the per share purchase price, multiplied by (ii) the number of whole shares that such employee was entitled to purchase in such Offering, in each case determined pursuant to the terms of the ESPP and by assuming that the "Offering End Date" and "Purchase Date" (as defined in the ESPP) occurred immediately prior to the date of the Change of Control. 

  

 Section 3.3 _ Exchange and Payment._ 

   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). On the day of (and immediately following) the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of Shares, (i) certificates representing a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Maximum Stock Merger Consideration issuable to the Stockholders pursuant to Section 3.1 and (ii) an amount of cash sufficient to deliver to holders of Shares the Maximum Cash Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.1. Parent further agrees to provide to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, immediately available funds sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(c). Any cash and certificates representing Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to Section 3.1(a), except as provided in this Agreement. Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent. 

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates (" _Certificates_ ") and to each holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.1(a), (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and contain such other provisions as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.1(a). Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal (or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, upon delivery of such letter of transmittal), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require (a " _Proper Delivery_ "), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the 

        
  

whole number of shares that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1 (after taking into account any applicable proration or other
adjustments and aggregating any fractional shares resulting from all Shares
surrendered by such holder pursuant to the Merger), (B) the Cash Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1
in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
and/or (C) a check in the amount of the cash that such holder is entitled to
be paid in respect of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to Section 3.3(e) and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section
3.3(d), if any, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration
payable in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Payment of Merger
Consideration shall be made as promptly as practicable after the date of
Proper Delivery of the applicable Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  

 (c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. 

  

 (d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, pursuant to Section 3.1(a), without any interest thereon. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to the Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share who is entitled to receive Parent Common Stock upon such surrender, and no cash payment in respect of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.3(e), unless and until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall surrender such Certificate or return the form of letter of transmittal in the case of a Book-Entry Share, in accordance with Section 3.3(b). Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or return of the form of letter of transmittal in the case of a Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificates or Book-Entry Share that are entitled to shares of Parent Common Stock, without interest, (i) an amount equal to the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock for which the Shares represented by the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares were exchanged for, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, an amount equal to the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the date of surrender of such holder\'s Certificate or return of the form of letter of transmittal in the case of a Book-Entry Share, and a payment date occurring after the date of surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock which the Shares represented by the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares were exchanged for. 

  

 (e) In lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be issuable pursuant to the Merger, each holder of Shares who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such holder\'s respective proportionate interest in the proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent for the Merger, on behalf of all such holders, of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common Stock deemed issued pursuant to the Merger. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the holders of Shares pursuant to the Merger (including 

        
  

fractional shares), over (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be distributed to former holders of Shares pursuant to the Merger (excluding
fractional shares) (such excess being collectively called the " _Excess
Merger Parent Stock_ "). The Exchange Agent, as agent and trustee for the
former holders of Shares, shall as promptly as reasonably practicable sell
the Excess Merger Parent Stock at the prevailing prices on the NYSE. The sales
of the Excess Merger Parent Stock by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed
in round lots to the extent practicable. Parent shall pay all commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the
expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent and costs associated with
calculating and distributing the respective cash amounts payable to the
applicable former holders of Shares, incurred in connection with such sales
of Excess Merger Parent Stock. Until the proceeds of such sales have been
distributed to the former holders of Shares to whom fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock otherwise would have been issued in the Offer, the
Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former holders. As
soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid
to former holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, the Exchange Agent shall distribute such amounts to such former
holders.

   

 (f) All Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares. 

  

 (g) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand. 

  

 (h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, without interest. 

  

 (i) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

        

 (k) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.3(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected as described in Section 3.5 shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

  

 Section 3.4 _ Withholding Rights._ Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options, RSUs or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 Section 3.5 _ Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder\'s right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(a). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments received by the Company relating to rights to appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

No Company Stock Options or RSUs that are outstanding have been granted other than pursuant to the Company Stock Plans.

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger and if required by applicable Law, to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the holders of at least a majority in combined voting power of the outstanding Shares (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by 

        
  

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally or by general
principles of equity).

 (c) In the event that Section 253 of the DGCL is inapplicable and unavailable to effectuate the Merger, the Company Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company\'s capital stock or other securities required in connection with the consummation of the Merger. No vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company\'s capital stock or other securities is required in connection with the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated by the Company other than the Merger.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any communication from any regulatory agency or been notified since January 1, 2007 that any product approval is withdrawn or modified or that such an action is under consideration. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance, in all material respects, with all current applicable statutes, rules, regulations, guidelines, policies or orders administered or issued by the FDA (" _FDA Laws_ ") or comparable foreign Governmental Entity (" _Foreign Drug Laws_ ") including FDA\'s Quality System Regulation, 21 C.F.R. Part 820; the Company does not have knowledge of any facts which furnish any reasonable basis for any Form FDA-483 observations or regulatory or warning letters from the FDA, Section 305 notices, or other similar communications from the FDA or comparable foreign entity. Since January 1, 2007, there have been no recalls, detentions, withdrawals, seizures, or termination or suspension of manufacturing requested or threatened relating to the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' products, and no material field notifications, material field corrections or material alerts. 

  

 (c) The Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' products, where required, are being marketed in all material respects under valid pre market notifications under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), and 21 C.F.R. Part 807, Subpart E (" _510(k)\'s_ ") or pre-market 

        
  

approval applications approved by the FDA in accordance with 21 U.S.C. §
360(e) and 21 C.F.R. Part 814 (" _PMA\'s_ "). All 510(k)\'s and PMA\'s for
the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' products are exclusively owned by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries, and there is no reason to believe that FDA
is considering limiting, suspending, or revoking any such 510(k)\'s or PMA\'s
or changing the marketing classification or labeling of any such products. To
the knowledge of the Company, there is no false information or significant
omission in any product application or product-related submission to the FDA
or comparable foreign Governmental Entity. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have obtained all necessary regulatory approvals from any foreign regulatory
agencies related to the products distributed and sold by the Company, and the
Company has not received any notice that any Governmental Entity seeks any
material additional conditions on the distribution or sale of products in a
jurisdiction covered by a regulatory approval. To the knowledge of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, any third party that is a manufacturer, contractor, or
agent for the Company or its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Permits
and regulatory approvals from the FDA or comparable Governmental Entity
insofar as they pertain to the manufacture of product components or products
for the Company or its Subsidiaries.

Property have been obtained, all leases of Leased Real Property shall remain

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases, except for any such failure to do so that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

This Section 4.18 does not relate to intellectual property, which is the
subject of Section 4.19.

  

 Section 4.19 _ Intellectual Property._ 

   

 (a) As used herein, the term " _Intellectual Property_ " means all intellectual property rights arising under the laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction, including the following: (i) trade names, trademarks and service marks (registered and unregistered), domain names, trade dress and similar rights and applications to register any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Marks_ "); (ii) patents and patent applications and rights in respect of utility models or industrial designs (collectively, " _Patents_ "); (iii) copyrights and registrations and applications therefor (collectively, " _Copyrights_ "); and (iv) know-how, inventions, discoveries, methods, processes, technical data, specifications, research and development information, technology, data bases and other proprietary or confidential information, including customer lists, in each case that derives economic value (actual or potential) from not being generally known to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure, but excluding any Copyrights or Patents that cover or protect any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Trade Secrets_ "). 

  

 (b) Section 4.19(b)(1) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate and complete list of all registered Marks and applications for registration of Marks owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, excluding any Marks that are exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are not being used in the current conduct of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' businesses (collectively, " _Company Registered Marks_ "), Section 4.19(b)(2) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate and complete list of all Patents owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, excluding any Patents that are exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are not being used in the current conduct of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' businesses (collectively, " _Company Patents_ ") and Section 4.19(b)(3) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate and complete list of all registered Copyrights and all pending applications for registration of Copyrights owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company 

        
  

or any of its Subsidiaries, excluding any Copyrights that are exclusively
licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are not being used in
the current conduct of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' businesses
(collectively, " _Company Registered Copyrights_ " and, together with the
Company Registered Marks and the Company Patents, " _Company Registered IP_
"). No Company Registered IP owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or, to knowledge of the Company, exclusively licensed to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has been or is now involved in any interference, reissue,
reexamination, opposition, nullity or cancellation proceeding and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no such action is or has been threatened with
respect to any of the Company Registered IP. The Company Registered IP owned
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to knowledge of the
Company, exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
subsisting. To the knowledge of the Company, the Company Registered IP
(excluding any pending applications included in the Company Registered IP) is
valid and enforceable and, except as set forth on Section 4.19(b)(4) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, no written or, to the knowledge of the Company,
oral notice or claim challenging the validity or enforceability or alleging
the misuse of any of the Company Registered IP has been received by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take
any action that would reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment,
cancellation, forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or unenforceability of
any of the Company Registered IP, and all filing, examination, issuance, post
registration and maintenance fees, annuities and the like that have come due
and are required to maintain, preserve or renew any of the Company Registered
IP owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to knowledge of the
Company, exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have
been timely paid. Except as set forth on Section 4.19(b)(5) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, with respect to the Company Registered IP owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and to the knowledge of the Company with
respect to the Company Registered IP exclusively licensed to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, there are no filings, payments or other actions that
were required to have been or are required to be made or taken by January 15,
2011, including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees
or the filing of any responses to office actions, documents, applications or
certificates, for the purposes of complying with legal requirements to
obtain, maintain, preserve or renew any Company Registered IP.

  

 (c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps to protect their rights in the Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries and maintain the confidentiality of all of the Trade Secrets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. All current or former employees, consultants and contractors who have participated in the creation of any Intellectual Property that is used by the Company or its Subsidiaries have entered into proprietary information, confidentiality and assignment agreements substantially in the Company\'s standard forms (which have previously been provided to Parent). 

  

 (d) The Company or its Subsidiaries own, or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use, all of the Intellectual Property that is necessary for the conduct of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' businesses. None of the Intellectual Property owned by or, to the knowledge of the Company, licensed to, the Company or its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, judgment, or stipulation restricting the use or exploitation thereof by the Company or its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (e) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not result in the loss or impairment of, or give rise to any right of any third party to terminate or re-price or otherwise modify any of the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' rights or obligations under any Material Contract as defined in Section 4.16(a)(viii) of this Agreement. The rights licensed under each agreement granting to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, any material right or license under or with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by a third party shall be exercisable by the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary, respectively, on and immediately after the Closing to the same extent 

        
  

as by the Company or such Subsidiary prior to the Closing. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted to any third party any
exclusive rights under any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries. All milestones and other conditions set forth in any license
agreements under which Intellectual Property is licensed to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that are required to be satisfied in order for the
Company or such Subsidiary to retain any exclusive rights granted under such
agreements have been timely satisfied and all such exclusive rights remain
in full force and effect.

  

 (f) The Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries owns exclusively all right, title and interest to the Company Registered IP (other than Company Registered IP exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) and all other Intellectual Property purportedly owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written or, to the knowledge of the Company, oral notice or claim challenging the Company\'s or such Subsidiary\'s ownership of any of such Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the Company, no loss, impairment or expiration of any Intellectual Property rights used in the Company\'s and the Subsidiaries\' business as currently conducted is pending or threatened. 

  

 (g) The conduct of the Company\'s and the Subsidiaries\' business as currently conducted, including the use or other exploitation of the Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has not infringed, misappropriated, diluted or violated, and does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute or violate, in any material respect, any Intellectual Property of any third party or constitute unfair competition or unfair trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written or, to the knowledge of the Company, oral notice or claim asserting or suggesting that any such infringement, misappropriation, violation, dilution, unfair competition or unfair trade practice has occurred, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is there any reasonable basis therefor. To the knowledge of the Company, (i) no third party is, in any material respect, misappropriating or infringing any material Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) no third party has made any unauthorized disclosure of any Trade Secrets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (h) To the knowledge of the Company, at no time during the conception of or reduction to practice of any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was any developer, inventor or other contributor to such Intellectual Property operating under any grants from any Governmental Entity or private source, performing research sponsored by any Governmental Entity or private source or subject to any employment agreement or invention assignment or nondisclosure agreement or other obligation with any third party, in each case that would impair or limit the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' rights in such Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the Company, there exist no inventions by current or former employees or consultants of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries made or otherwise conceived prior to their beginning employment or consultation with the Company or such Subsidiary that have been or are intended to be incorporated into any of the Company\'s Intellectual Property or products, other than any such inventions that have been validly and irrevocably assigned or licensed to the Company by written agreement. 

  

 (i) To the knowledge of the Company, there has been no prior use of any Company Registered Mark or any material unregistered Mark adopted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Company Marks_ ") by any third party that would confer upon such third party superior rights in such Company Mark. 

  

 Section 4.20 _ Products._ Since January 1, 2007, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company any distributor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has received a claim for or based upon breach of product or service warranty or guaranty or similar claim, strict liability in tort, negligent design of product, negligent provision of services or any other allegation of liability, including or arising from the materials, design, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling 

        
  

(including instructions for use), or sale of its products or from the
provision of services, in each case that would not result in material
liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries in excess of the warranty
reserve reflected on the Company\'s balance sheet as of June 30, 2010.

   

 Section 4.21 _ Accounts Receivable._ All of the accounts and notes receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth on the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries (net of the applicable reserves reflected on the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and in the Financial Statements) (i) represent sales actually made or transactions actually effected in the ordinary course of business for goods or services delivered or rendered to unaffiliated customers in bona fide arm\'s length transactions, (ii) constitute valid claims, and (iii) are good and collectible at the aggregate recorded amounts thereof (net of such reserves) without right of recourse, defense, deduction, return of goods, counterclaim, or offset.

The quantities of all inventories, materials, and supplies of the Company and its Subsidiaries (net of the obsolescence reserves therefor shown in the Financial Statements and determined in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) are not obsolete, damaged, slow-moving, defective, or excessive, and are reasonable and balanced in the circumstances of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 Section 4.23 _ State Takeover Statutes._ The Company has elected in its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to not be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL. Other than Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes, no other "moratorium," "fair price," "business combination," "control share acquisition" or similar provision of any state statutory anti-takeover Law (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") applies to this Agreement, the Offer or the Mergers. 

  

 Section 4.24 _ No Rights Plan._ There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison pill" anti-takeover plan or other similar device in effect to which the Company is a party or is otherwise bound. 

  

 Section 4.25 _ Related Party Transactions._ No present director, executive officer, stockholder owning 5% or more of the Company\'s Shares, or Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, or any of such Person\'s Affiliates or immediate family members (each of the foregoing, a " _Related Party_ "), is a party to any Contract with or binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or has any interest in any property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or has engaged in any transaction with any of the foregoing within the last 12 months or that has continuing obligations, in each case, that is of a type that would be required to be disclosed in the Company SEC Documents pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no former director or officer is party to any such Contract that was not entered into on an arms-length basis (an " _Affiliate Transaction_ ") that has not been so disclosed. Any Affiliate Transaction as of the time it was entered into and as of the time of any amendment or renewal thereof contained such terms, provisions and conditions as were at least as favorable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as would have been obtainable by the Company in a similar transaction with an unaffiliated third party. To the knowledge of the Company, no Related Party of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owns, directly or indirectly, on an individual or joint basis, any material interest in, or serves as an officer or director or in another similar capacity of, any supplier or other independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any organization which has a Contract with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 Section 4.26 _ Brokers._ No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than Piper Jaffray and Co., the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Company, is entitled to 

        
  

any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Affiliates. The Company has furnished to Parent a true and complete copy of

 Section 4.27 _ Opinion of Financial Advisor._ The Company has received the opinion of Piper Jaffray and Co., dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, subject to the assumptions, qualifications and other matters set forth therein, as of such date, the consideration to be received by the holders of Shares (other than as set forth in such opinion) pursuant to this Agreement, is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of Shares, a signed true and complete copy of which opinion has been provided to Parent. 

  

 Section 4.28 _ Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties._ Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or representatives is making any representation or warranty on behalf of the Company of any kind or nature whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied (including, but not limited to, any relating to financial condition, results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries), except as expressly set forth in Article IV of this Agreement (as qualified by the introductory paragraph to Article IV) and the representations and warranties referred to in Section 6.9(c), and the Company hereby disclaims any and all such other representations and warranties. Without limiting the express representations and warranties in this Article IV (including any representations and warranties regarding documents delivered or made available to Parent), and without limiting the broad nature of the disclaimer set forth in the prior sentence, no representation or warranty is being made as a result of the Company making available to Parent and Merger Sub any management presentations, information, documents, projections, forecasts and other material in a "data room" or otherwise.

 Section 5.5 _ Certain Information._ Neither the Registration Statement, nor the Post-Effective Amendment, nor the Offer Documents will, at the respective times they are first filed with the SEC, amended or supplemented or first published, sent or given to the Stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Registration Statement, the Post-Effective Amendment, and the Offer Documents will, at the respective times they are first filed with the SEC, at the respective times they are amended or supplemented and as of as of the date first published, sent or given to the Stockholders, comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. Immediately preceding and during the period used to calculate the Average Trading Price, the Parent SEC Documents will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading during the entirety of such period (except as promptly corrected in accordance with Section 6.10(c)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Post-Effective Amendment, or the Offer Documents based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement will, at the respective times they are first published, sent or given to the Stockholders and, in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the time of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to statements included or incorporated by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by or on behalf of Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. The registration statement filed under Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes (and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will not when filed with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota or at the time of distribution or dissemination thereof to the Stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to statements made therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for inclusion in such registration statement. The registration statement filed under Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes Annotated will comply as to form in all material respects with applicable provisions of Minnesota Law and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

  

 Section 5.6 _ Merger Sub._ Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and has engaged in no business other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is owned directly or indirectly by Parent. 

  

 Section 5.7 _ Financing._ Parent and Merger Sub will have, as of the respective dates of consummation of the Offer and the Merger, sufficient funds to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. 

       

                                    

    

  Section 5.8 _ Vote/Approval Required._ No vote or consent of
the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to
approve this Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The vote or consent of Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub
(which shall have occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the only vote or
consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub
necessary to approve this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger.

  

 Section 5.9 _ Ownership of Shares._ Except as previously disclosed to the Company, neither Parent nor Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries beneficially owns any Shares as of the date hereof. 

  

 Section 5.10 _ Litigation._ Except for matters which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents, there are no civil, criminal, administrative or regulatory actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 Section 5.11 _ SEC Reports._ 

  

 (a) Parent has filed all required forms, reports and documents with the SEC since December 31, 2007 (" _Parent SEC Documents_ "), and each of such Parent SEC Documents complied at the time of filing (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then as of the date of such filing) in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as in effect on the dates such forms, reports and documents were filed. None of the Parent SEC Documents contained when filed any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, except to the extent superseded or amended by a Parent SEC Report filed subsequently and prior to the date hereof. As of October 13, 2010 and through the date of this Agreement, none of the Parent SEC Documents filed since January 1, 2010 (except to the extent superseded or amended by a Parent SEC Report filed subsequently to any particular report and prior to the date hereof) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (i) have been prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and maintained throughout the periods indicated and (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (except in each case as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except that unaudited statements are subject to normal year-end adjustments that did not have and would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and do not contain footnotes in substance or form required to the extent permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act). 

  

 (b) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in Parent\'s periodic and current reports under the Exchange Act, is made known to Parent\'s chief executive officer and its chief financial officer by others within those entities to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act. The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company\'s disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. 

        

 (c) Parent and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Parent\'s financial reporting and the preparation of the Parent\'s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to Parent\'s auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting. 

  

 Section 5.12 _ Compliance with Laws._ The businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries are being conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws or any foreign country or any political subdivision thereof or of any Governmental Entity, except for violations or possible violations that do not and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor, to the knowledge of Parent, has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, other than in each case those would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 5.13 _ No Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of Certain Changes._ Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the notes thereto), other than liabilities and obligations incurred since December 31, 2009, which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 5.14 _ Tax Treatment._ Neither Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any of its Affiliates has taken or has agreed to take any action or knows of any fact that could be reasonably expected to prevent the Merger from constituting a "reorganization" qualifying under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

 Section 5.15 _ Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, nor any of their Affiliates or representatives is making any representation or warranty to the Company on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub of any kind or nature whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied (including, but not limited to, any relating to financial condition, results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries), except as expressly set forth in Article V of this Agreement and the representations and warranties referred to in Section 6.9(c), and Parent and Merger Sub hereby disclaim any and all such other representations and warranties to the Company. Without limiting the express representations and warranties in this Article V, and without limiting the broad nature of the disclaimer set forth in the prior sentence, no representation or warranty is being made as a result of Parent\'s making available to the Company or any of its Affiliates, Stockholders or Representatives any management presentations, information, documents, projections, forecasts and other material in a "data room" or otherwise. Nothing in this Section 5.15 is intended to mitigate Parent\'s obligations under applicable securities Laws.

 Section 6.2 _ No Solicitation._ 

  

 (a) Except as permitted by this Section 6.2, the Company shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of its Subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information or data with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) adopt a resolution or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall direct each of its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement. Notwithstanding the 

        
  

foregoing, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, (1) the Company or its
Representatives receives a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board believes in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such Acquisition Proposal
was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section
6.2, (3) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (4)
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to take the actions referred to in clause (x), (y)
or (z) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law, then the Company may (x) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the
Company than, those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
that any non-public information provided to any Person given such access
shall have been previously provided to Parent or shall be provided to Parent
prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, (y)
engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal and (z) grant
a waiver or release to any Person subject to a "standstill" agreement with
the Company to submit such Acquisition Proposal (provided that Parent and its
Subsidiaries are simultaneously released from any standstill that they may be
bound to with respect to the Company). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company
may communicate with any Person or group of Persons that has submitted an
Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and did not otherwise involve a
breach of this Section 6.2 for the limited purpose of clarifying the terms and
conditions thereof, provided that such requests for clarifications do not
become negotiations or discussions prior to the Company\'s compliance with the
terms of this Section 6.2.

  

 (b) Except as permitted by this Section 6.2, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub) the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable to the stockholders of the Company the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal or (C) adopt a resolution or agree to take any such actions (each such action set forth in this Section 6.2(b)(i) being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) (A) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract other than a confidentiality or similar agreement (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or (B) adopt a resolution or agree to take any such actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company Board may, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either (I) a Superior Proposal or (II) material changes in circumstances that are not related to an Acquisition Proposal and were not known to the Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of or prior to the date of this Agreement (an " _Intervening Event_ ") or (y) solely in response to a Superior Proposal received after the date hereof that was unsolicited and did not otherwise involve a breach of this Section 6.2, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) (including payment of the Termination Fee or the Alternative Termination Fee) and concurrently enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal as referred to above or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement unless (1) the Company promptly notifies 

        
  

Parent in writing at least five Business Days before taking any such action
of its intention to do so, and specifying the reasons therefor, including the
terms and conditions of, and the identity of any Person making, such Superior
Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishing a copy of the relevant Alternative
Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant transaction documents (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by
the Company and a single new five Business Day period commencing on the date
of such new notice) and (2) prior to the expiration of such five Business Day
period, Parent does not make a bona fide proposal to adjust the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) would
cause such initial Superior Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal after
giving effect to, among other things, the payment of the Termination Fee or
Alternative Termination Fee set forth in Section 8.3; _provided further_ ,
that the Company Board may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event as referred to above unless the Company (A)
provides Parent with written information describing such Intervening Event in
reasonable detail as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of
it, (B) keeps Parent reasonably informed of developments with respect to
such Intervening Event, (C) notifies Parent in writing at least five Business
Days before making an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifying the reasons
therefor and (D) prior to the expiration of such five Business Day period,
Parent does not make a bona fide proposal that results in the Company Board
determining that such action is no longer inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. During the
five Business Day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminating this Agreement or entering into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement as referred to above, the Company shall, and shall cause
its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to
the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. In the
event that Parent does make a bona fide proposal to adjust the terms and
conditions of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.2(b), that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
its financial advisor) would cause such initial Superior Proposal to cease to
be a Superior Proposal after giving effect to, among other things, the payment
of the Termination Fee or Alternative Termination Fee set forth in Section
8.3, and the Person making the proposal giving rise to the provisions of this
Section 6.2(b) subsequently materially amends its proposal such that the
provisions of the foregoing proviso are triggered again, then the period of
Business Days referred to in the proviso above shall be reduced to
three Business Days for the second time such provisions are triggered and to
two Business Days for each subsequent time that such provisions are triggered
again. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if such provisions
are triggered or continuing to be triggered five Business Days prior to the
scheduled expiration of the Offer by repeated proposals by Parent to adjust
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and repeated adjustments to the
proposal from the third Person that triggered the provisions of this Section
6.2, then the Company may make a factually accurate public statement by the
Company that describes the status of the process taking place with respect to
such bidding. For the avoidance of doubt, prior to making a determination as
to whether failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.2(b) or enter into an Alterative
Acquisition Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Shareholders under applicable Law, the Company Board shall take into account
any bona fide adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that are offered by
Parent pursuant to this Section 6.2(b).

  

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections 6.2(a) and (b), the Company promptly, and in any event within 36 hours of receipt, shall advise Parent in writing in the event the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information, discussion or negotiation that the Company Board determines in good faith is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry, 

        
  

proposal or offer that the Company Board determines is reasonably likely to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case together with a description of
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request,
inquiry, proposal or offer. The Company shall keep Parent informed (in
writing) in all material respects on a timely basis of the status and material
terms (including, within 36 hours after the occurrence of any material
amendment, modification, development, discussion or negotiation) of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer. Without limiting
any of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 36
hours) notify Parent in writing if it determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.2(a) or (b) and shall in no event
begin providing such information or engaging in such discussions or
negotiations prior to providing such notice, and provided that the Company
shall disclose to Parent the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal before engaging in such discussions or negotiations (other than
discussions or negotiations related solely to entering into a customary
confidentiality agreement prior to providing such information).

   

 (d) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.2 by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. 

  

 (e) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would restrict the Company\'s ability to comply with any of the terms of this Section 6.2, and represents that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement. 

   

 (f) The Company acknowledges that this Section 6.2 is a fundamental provision of this Agreement and that Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement except in reliance upon the Company\'s compliance with each of the Company\'s obligations under this Section 6.2. 

  

 (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or other applicable Law or from disclosing any information to the Company\'s Stockholders (including any factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Company\'s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto) when, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after receiving advice of outside counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s Stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall this Section 6.2(f) affect the obligations of the Company specified in Sections 6.2(b) and (c); and _provided further_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section 8.1(c)(ii)) unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Offer and Merger in such disclosure. For clarification, a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change. 

  

 (h) For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

  

 (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons (other than Parent and its Affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, including any merger, reorganization, consolidation, tender offer, self-tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or 

  

      

  

similar transaction, (A) of assets or businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that generate 10% or more of the net revenues or net income or
that represent 10% or more of the total assets (based on fair market value),
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to
such transaction, (B) of 10% or more of any class of capital stock, other
equity security or voting power of the Company or any resulting parent
company of the Company or (C) involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, individually or taken together, whose businesses constitute 10%
or more of the net revenues, net income or total assets (based on fair market
value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately
prior to such transaction, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and did not otherwise involve a breach of this Section 6.2 that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) (A) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, including, if such Acquisition Proposal requires financing, the financing terms thereof, including the likelihood of obtaining financing and the terms on which such financing may be secured and (B) if consummated, would result in a transaction that is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in response to such proposal pursuant to Section 6.2(b) or otherwise, and including any break-up fees and expense reimbursement provisions); _provided_ ,  _that_ , for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," references in the term "Acquisition Proposal" to "10%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%." 

  

 (iii) " _unsolicited_ " when used with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal means any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal for which the original Acquisition Proposal, or inquiry, proposal, or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, was unsolicited, even if negotiations or discussions conducted in accordance with this Section 6.2 later ensue with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. 

  

  

 Section 6.3 _ Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders\' Meeting._ 

   

 (a) If approval of the Stockholders is required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger, then as promptly as practicable following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer (and in any event within 15 Business Days after the date thereof), the Company shall file a Proxy Statement with the SEC in preliminary form as required by the Exchange Act, and Parent shall file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement (the " _Post-Effective Amendment_ ") for the offer and sale of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger and in which the Proxy Statement will be included. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Post-Effective Amendment declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Post-Effective Amendment is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of capital stock of the Company as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Post-Effective Amendment will be made by Parent, or with respect to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives 

        
  

notice thereof, of the time when the Post-Effective Amendment has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for the amendment of the Post-
Effective Amendment or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by
the SEC for additional information. The Company will advise Parent, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for the amendment
of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to either of the Post-Effective Amendment or the Proxy Statement, so that any
of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, disseminated to the Stockholders. Parent shall cause all
Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and all other Shares owned beneficially
or of record by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent to be
voted in favor of the approval of the Merger and adoption of the Merger at
the Company Stockholders\' Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof.

  

 (b) If approval of the Stockholders is required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger, then as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Post-Effective Amendment becomes effective, the Company shall establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its Stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders\' Meeting_ ") solely for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Except in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted by Section 6.2(b), the Company, through the Company Board, shall (i) recommend to its Stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (iii) publicly reaffirm such recommendation within 24 hours after a request to do so by Parent or Merger Sub. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of any Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), if following the expiration of the Offer or the exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent shall collectively hold at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall (subject to Section 7.1) take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the consummation of the purchase of the Shares without a meeting of Stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. 

  

 Section 6.4 _ Access to Information; Confidentiality._ The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to all their respective properties, assets, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent: (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request (including Tax Returns filed and those in preparation and the workpapers of its auditors); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not require 

        
  

the Company to disclose any information to the extent such disclosure would
(i) contravene applicable Law, (ii) breach or cause a default under any
confidentiality agreement with any third party entered into prior to the date
hereof that relate to any discussions regarding transactions of a nature
similar to the transactions contemplated hereby (provided that disclosures
required pursuant to Section 6.2 with respect to a party to any such
confidentiality agreement or any proposals they may make shall not be limited
by this Section 6.2(ii)), or (iii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client
privilege held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All such information
shall be held confidential in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement between Parent and the Company dated as of July
9, 2010, as amended by the Addendum thereto dated September 10, 2010 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.4
or information provided, made available or delivered to Parent pursuant to
this Agreement shall affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties
hereunder.

   

 Section 6.5 _ Reasonable Best Efforts._ 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all required consents, approvals or waivers from, or participation in other discussions or negotiations with, third parties, including as required under any Material Contract, (ii) obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities, make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings and take all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any Action by, any Governmental Entity, including filings under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and any required foreign antitrust filings, (iii) vigorously resist and contest any Action, including administrative or judicial Action, and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that could restrict, prevent or prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and (iv) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and fully to carry out the purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall commit to the payment of any material fee, penalty or other consideration or make any other material concession, waiver or amendment under any Contract in connection with obtaining any consent without the prior written consent of Parent. Each of the parties hereto shall furnish to each other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult with the other in connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Parent and the Company shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other written communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or third party with respect to such transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, shall provide the other party and its counsel with the opportunity to participate in any 

        
  

meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation
or other inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to (i) agree or proffer to divest or hold separate (in a trust or otherwise), or take any other action with respect to, any of the assets or businesses of Parent or any of its Affiliates or, assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates, (ii) agree or proffer to limit in any manner whatsoever or not to exercise any rights of ownership of any securities (including the Shares) or (iii) enter into any agreement that in any way limits the ownership or operation of any business of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, in each case if such action would be material to the business and financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or to the value of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Parent after consummation of the Offer and the Mergers. 

  

 Section 6.6 _ Takeover Laws._ The Company and the Company Board shall (a) take no action to cause any Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and (b) if any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, use reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 6.7 _ Notification of Certain Matters._ The Company and Parent shall promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any other notice or communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, or (c) any Action commenced or, to such party\'s knowledge, threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relates to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 6.8 _ Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current or former officer or director may have under the Company Charter or Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, from the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each current (as of the Effective Time) and each former officer and director of the Company from and against any and all loss and liability suffered and expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the indemnified Person is or was an officer, director, employee or fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would be permitted under applicable Law and required or permitted under the Company Charter or Company Bylaws (or, as relevant, those of the applicable Subsidiary of the Company) as at the date hereof. In the event of any such Action, each indemnified Person shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent that the Company would be permitted under applicable Law and the Company Charter or Company Bylaws as at the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (but subject to any superior rights contained in the Company Charter of Company Bylaws (or, as relevant, those of the applicable Subsidiary of the Company) or applicable indemnification 

        
  

agreements to which the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, is a
party), prior to making any payment or advance in respect of the
indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 6.8, the Person who is
requesting such advance shall provide a written affirmation by such Person of
a good faith belief that the criteria for indemnification set forth under
applicable Law have been satisfied and a written undertaking by such Person
to repay all amounts so paid or reimbursed by the Surviving Corporation, if it
is ultimately determined that the criteria for indemnification have not been
satisfied in connection with any threatened, pending, or completed civil,
criminal, administrative, arbitration or investigative proceeding to which
such Person is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the former
or present official capacity of such Person. No such indemnified Person shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened
or actual Action for which indemnification could be sought by such indemnified
Person hereunder unless Parent consents in writing to such settlement,
compromise or consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Surviving Corporation agrees to continue and not to
repeal or modify, and agree to include, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, in the charter documents for the Surviving Corporation, exculpatory
provisions currently existing in the Company Charter (or their substantial
equivalent) eliminating personal liability for the Company\'s directors to
the extent permissible under the DGCL.

  

 (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the Company\'s current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies (a correct and complete copies of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than the Company\'s existing policies as of the date hereof or (ii) request that the Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); and _provided further_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Company be required to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this Section 6.8(b) in excess of 200% of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for policy year 2009-2010 for such purpose (which policy year 2009-2010 premiums are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be as set forth in Section 6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter), it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 200% amount. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries makes a distribution or dividend to Parent or another (direct or indirect) Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent that is not a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall fulfill the obligations of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Sections 6.8(a) and (b) to the extent of the amount of such distribution or dividend. 

  

 (c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8. 

   

 (d) It is the intent that with respect to all advancement and indemnification obligations under this Section 6.8, the Surviving Corporation shall be the indemnitor of first resort with respect to any advancement, reimbursement or indemnification obligations relative to any director or officer of the Company who may also be covered by insurance maintained by a shareholder of the Company at or prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the right of recovery against such director or officer if it shall be ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any right to seek contribution, indemnity or other reimbursement for any of its obligations under this Section 6.8 from any such stockholder of the Company or its insurers. 

       

                                     

    

  (e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive consummation
of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her
legal representatives, and each such Person shall be an intended third party
beneficiary of the provisions of this Section 6.8.

   

 Section 6.9 _ Tax-Free Reorganization._ 

  

 (a) Unless any condition to the Second Merger as set forth in Section 6.13 is not satisfied, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger, taken together with the Offer and the Second Merger, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 (b) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, provided the Second Merger occurs, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall report the Merger, taken together with the Offer and the Second Merger, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 (c) The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent\'s and the Company\'s tax counsel and tax advisors a certificate containing representations reasonably requested by such counsel and/or advisors in connection with the rendering of any tax opinions to be issued by such counsel and/or advisors with respect to the treatment of the Offer, the Merger and the Second Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent\'s and the Company\'s tax counsel and tax advisors shall be entitled to rely upon such representations in rendering any such opinions. 

  

 Section 6.10 _ Public Announcements._ 

  

 (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements (including announcements to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries) with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any public announcement (including announcements to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries) without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system _provided_ , that Parent or the Company may include disclosures relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated herein in its respective periodic filings with the SEC without seeking consent from, or consulting with, the other party, so long as such disclosures are substantially similar to the information contained in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company (or made individually by the Company or Parent, if previously consented to by the other party); _provided_ , further, that each of Parent and the Company may make any public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as such statements are substantially similar to the information contained in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company (or individually by a party, if previously consented to by the other party); _provided_ , _finally_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide Parent any such opportunity to review or comment in connection with the receipt and existence of an Acquisition Proposal and matters related thereto or an Adverse Recommendation Change or other communications contemplated by Section 6.2(e). 

  

 (b) Before any written communications related to the Offer of any party hereto or any of their respective "participants" (as defined in Rule 165 of the Securities Act) are (i) disseminated to any investor, analyst, member of the media, employee, client, customer or other third-party or otherwise 

        
  

made accessible on the website of such party or any such participant, as
applicable (whether in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or
otherwise), or (ii) used by any executive officer, key employee or advisor of
such party or any such participant, as applicable, as a script in discussions
or meetings with any such third parties, Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, shall (or shall cause any such participant to) cooperate in good
faith with respect to any such written communications related to the Offer for
purposes of, among other things, determining whether that communication
constitutes "tender offer material" that is required to be filed by Rule 14d-2
or Rule 14d-6 of the Exchange Act, as applicable. Each party shall (or shall
cause any such participant to) give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by the other such party or parties and their counsel on any
such written communications related to the Offer. For purposes of the
foregoing, written communications related to the Offer shall include, with
respect to any Person, any document or other written communication prepared
by or on behalf of that Person, or any document or other material or
information posted or made accessible on the website of that Person (whether

 Section 8.3 _ Fees and Expenses._ 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated, except that the expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement, and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC or in respect of the HSR Act, in each case in connection with the Merger (other than attorneys\' fees, accountants\' fees and related expenses), shall be borne by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, any fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby incurred by a Stockholder (such as fees and expenses of separate counsel to such Stockholder) shall be borne by such Stockholder. 

  

 (b) In the event that: 

  

  

 (i) (A) an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) or intention to make an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) shall have been made directly to the Stockholders, otherwise publicly disclosed or otherwise publicly communicated to senior management of the Company or the Company Board, (B) this Agreement is thereafter terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) or 8.1(c)(iii) or by the Company pursuant to 

  

      

  

Section 8.1(d)(iii) (unless, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(iii) or Section 8.1(d)(iii), immediately prior to such termination a
number of Shares satisfying the Minimum Condition shall have been tendered
into the Offer and not withdrawn) and (C) within 12 months after the date of
such termination, the Company enters into an agreement in respect of any
Acquisition Proposal and such transaction is subsequently consummated (whether
consummated before or after such 12-month period), or recommends or submits
an Acquisition Proposal to its Stockholders for adoption and such transaction
is subsequently consummated (whether consummated before or after such 12-month
period), or a transaction in respect of an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated within such 12-month period, which, in each case, need not be the
same Acquisition Proposal that shall have been made, publicly disclosed or
communicated prior to termination hereof ( _provided_ , that for purposes of
this clause (C), each reference to "10%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"); or

  

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii); or 

  

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(d)(ii); 

  

  

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of
$32,475,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event this Agreement is
terminated by (x) Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) or (y) the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), and the Adverse Recommendation Change or other
event referred to in Section 8.1(c)(ii) or the Superior Proposal that is the
basis for termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) is based on a Qualified
Acquisition Proposal, or if the Acquisition Proposal referred to in Section
8.3(b)(i)(A) in relation to a termination of this Agreement described in such
section is a Qualified Acquisition Proposal and the Acquisition Proposal
actually consummated is with the same Person as the Person who made the
Qualified Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall pay to Parent a termination
fee of $21,650,000 (the " _Alternative Termination Fee_ ") in lieu of the
Termination Fee. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Qualified Acquisition
Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Proposal (I) received no later than 11:59
p.m. Central Time on the 15th calendar day following the date of first public
announcement of this Agreement, (II) that was unsolicited and did not
otherwise involve a breach of Section 6.2, (III) that the Company Board
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor) was or was reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal and provided Parent notice of such determination no later than 11:59
p.m. Central Time on the 16th calendar day following the date of first public
announcement of this Agreement.

   

 (c) Payment of the Termination Fee or the Alternative Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent (i) on the consummation of, any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i), (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event, within two Business Days thereof), in the case of termination by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) or (iii) simultaneously with or prior to, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8(d)(ii). Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that in the event that Parent is entitled to receive either the Termination Fee or the Alternative Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement, the right of Parent to receive such amount shall constitute each of Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s sole and exclusive remedy for money damages for any termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , that nothing in the foregoing sentence shall constitute a waiver of Parent or Merger Sub\'s right to seek specific performance in accordance with Section 9.10 of this Agreement (nor shall any such action for specific performance prejudice Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s right to receive the Termination Fee or the Alternative Termination Fee if such action does not result in consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement). 

        

 (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3 from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Midwest Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. 

  

 Section 8.4 _ Amendment or Supplement._ This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after Merger Sub has accepted for payment and paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer, no amendment may be made which decreases the Merger Consideration and (b) after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the Stockholders without such further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the time of the amendment. 

  

 Section 8.5 _ Extension of Time; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the Stockholders without such further approval or adoption. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder. 

  

 Section 8.6 _ Effect of Termination on Offer._ In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) or 8.1(d)(ii) and Merger Sub elects not to terminate the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly amend the Offer to disclose that such Offer is no longer pursuant to this Agreement. Any Offer so amended and continued after the termination of this Agreement shall not be subject to any terms or conditions of this Agreement (and Parent and Merger Sub shall not be subject to any standstill agreement previously entered into). In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any subsection of Section 8.1 other than 8.1(c)(ii) or 8.1(d)(ii), then as promptly as practicable after such termination, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, terminate the Offer. Nothing in this Section 8.6 shall be construed as a standstill or restriction that would limit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from acquiring capital stock of the Company by any means at any time after termination of this Agreement and (in the case of the preceding sentence, termination of the Offer).
