Consideration. If an adjustment to the Maximum Stock Consideration and the Maximum Cash Consideration occurs by reason of this Section&nbsp;1.1(f), such adjustment shall be allocated among all

current reports under the Exchange Act, is made known to Parent's chief executive officer and its chief financial officer by others within those entities to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures as required under the Exchange Act. The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Document that is a report on Form&nbsp;10-K or Form&nbsp;10-Q, or any amendment
thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. </FONT></P>
