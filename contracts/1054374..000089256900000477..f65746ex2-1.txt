                                    ARTICLE 1

later time as may be agreed to by the parties and set forth in the Agreement of
Merger being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

        1.3 Effect of the Merger on Constituent Corporations. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions
of the California Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Merger Sub and the Company shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities
and duties of Merger Sub and the Company shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

        1.4 Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of Surviving Corporation.

                (a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended
and restated in their entirety in the form set forth as Annex 1 to Exhibit D to
this Agreement, and, as so amended and restated, shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time
until thereafter amended as provided by law and such articles of incorporation
and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

                (b) The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by such by-laws, the articles of incorporation
and applicable law.

        1.5 Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

        1.6 Maximum Number of Shares of Parent Common Stock to be Issued; Effect
on Outstanding Securities of the Company. The maximum number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued (including Parent Common Stock to be reserved for
issuance upon exercise of any of the Company Options, Company Warrants or
Company Stock Purchase Rights to be assumed by Parent as provided herein) in
exchange for the acquisition by Parent of all shares of Company Capital Stock
which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and all
vested and unvested Company Options, Company Warrants and Company Stock Purchase
Rights which are then outstanding shall be the Aggregate Share Number. No
adjustment shall be made in the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued
in the Merger as a result of any consideration (in any form whatsoever) received
by the Company from the date hereof to the Effective Time as a result of any
exercise, conversion or exchange of Company Options, Company Warrants or Company
Stock Purchase Rights. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any shares of
the Company Capital Stock or Company Options, Company Warrants or Company Stock
Purchase Rights, the following shall occur:



                                      -4-
<PAGE>   14

                (a) Conversion of Company Capital Stock. Each share of Company
Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Company Capital Stock to be canceled pursuant to
Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as provided in Section 1.7)) will be
cancelled and extinguished and each share of Company Series A Preferred Stock,
Company Series B Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock which is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive, following the expiration or early
termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act which is applicable to the
holder of such share (due to the making of a filing by such holder under the HSR
Act), that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Series A
Exchange Ratio, the Series B Exchange Ratio or the Common Stock Exchange Ratio,
as applicable (subject to Section 1.6(e).

                (b) Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Company-Owned Stock. Each
share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or the Company or any Subsidiary
of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and
without any further action on the part of Parent or the Company.

                (c) Company Options and Company Stock Option Plan. All unexpired
and unexercised Company Options, Company Warrants and Company Stock Purchase
Rights, then outstanding, whether vested or unvested, together with the Company
Stock Option Plan, shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with provisions
described below.

                        (i) At the Effective Time, each unexpired and
unexercised Company Option, Company Warrant and Company Stock Purchase Right
then outstanding, whether vested or unvested, shall be, in connection with the
Merger, assumed by Parent, together with the Company Stock Option Plan. Each
Company Option, Company Warrant and Company Stock Purchase Right so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Option, Company Warrant
or Company Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including, but not limited to, any repurchase rights or vesting provisions),
provided that (I) such Company Option, Company Warrant or Company Stock Purchase
Right, as the case may be, shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Capital Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option, Company
Warrant or Company Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio applicable to the series of Company Capital
Stock subject to such Company Option, Company Warrant or Company Stock Purchase
Right (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock) and (II) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option, Company Warrant or
Company Stock Purchase Right, as the case may be, shall be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Capital Stock at
which such Company Option, Company Warrant or Company Stock Purchase Right was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio
applicable to the series of Company Capital Stock subject to such Company
Option, Company Warrant or Company Stock Purchase Right (rounded to the nearest
whole cent).



                                      -5-
<PAGE>   15

                        (ii) It is the intention of the parties that the Company
Options assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the same extent
the Company Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to
the Effective Time and the provisions of this Section 1.6(c) shall be applied
consistent with this intent.

                        (iii) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent will
issue to each holder of an unexpired and unexercised Company Option, Company
Warrant or Company Stock Purchase Right an instrument evidencing the foregoing
assumption of such Company Option, Company Warrant or Company Stock Purchase
Right by Parent.

                        (iv) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the
Company's obligations, and shall be assigned the Company's repurchase rights and
purchase options, under any Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements listed on
Schedule 1.6(c)(iv), true and correct copies of which have been made available
by the Company to Parent. Any and all restrictions on the Company Restricted
Stock issued pursuant to such agreements which do not lapse in accordance with
their terms (as in effect on January 1, 2000) shall continue in full force and
effect until such restrictions lapse pursuant to the terms of such agreements,
and any repurchase rights or repurchase options which the Company has with
respect to the Company Restricted Stock shall also continue in full force and
effect.

                        (v) Parent will reserve sufficient shares of Parent
Common Stock for issuance pursuant to this Section 1.6(c).

                (d) Adjustments to Exchange Ratios. The Exchange Ratios shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse
split, stock combination, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock),
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock the effective date of
which occurs after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

                (e) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock will be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares
of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall be entitled to receive from
Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
product of (a) such fraction, multiplied by (b) the Closing Price.

                (f) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after
the Effective Time, each share certificate of Merger Sub theretofore evidencing
ownership of any such shares shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

        1.7 Dissenting Shares.

                (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has demanded
and perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the California
Code and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost
such appraisal rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, but
the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the
California Code.

                (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.7(a) above, if
any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such
shares under the California Code shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the later
of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the occurrence of such event, such holder's
shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
receive Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 1.6, without interest
thereon, upon surrender to the Company of the certificate representing such
shares in accordance with Section 1.8 of this Agreement.

                (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of its
receipt of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital
Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments relating to the
Merger served pursuant to the California Code and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the California Code. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as may be required under
applicable law, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal of Company Capital Stock or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

        1.8 Exchange Procedures.

                (a) Parent Common Stock. On the Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article 1,
the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock; provided, however, that, on behalf
of the holders of Company Capital Stock, Parent shall deposit into an escrow
account a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Escrow Amount.
The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each holder of Company
Capital Stock shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive by virtue
of ownership of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock.

                (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the
"Certificates") and which shares were converted into the right to receive shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions



                                      -7-
<PAGE>   17

as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares
of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited in the Escrow
Fund on such holder's behalf pursuant to Article 7 hereof), to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 and cash in lieu of fractional shares to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(e), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 hereof, Parent
shall cause to be distributed to the Depositary Agent a certificate or
certificates (in such denominations as may be requested by the Depositary Agent)
representing that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Escrow
Amount, which certificate shall be registered in the name of the Depositary
Agent. Such shares shall be beneficially owned by the holders on whose behalf
such shares were deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be available to
compensate Parent as provided in Article 7. Until surrendered, each outstanding
Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company
Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends, to evidence the
ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such
shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so converted (subject only to,
if applicable, the expiration or early termination of any waiting period under
the HSR Act which is applicable to the holder of such shares due to the making
of a filing by such holder under the HSR Act) and cash in lieu of fractional
shares.

                (c) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Company
Capital Stock. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock declared or made after the Effective Time and with a record date after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the
holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject
to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time
of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable (but for the provisions of
this Section 1.8(c)) with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

                (d) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of
Parent Common Stock is to be issued pursuant to the Merger in a name other than
that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered
will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated
by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of



                                      -8-
<PAGE>   18

the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the
satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid
or is not payable.

        1.9 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash in lieu of
fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Company of shares
of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article 1.

        1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
certificates evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue certificates representing
such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof; provided, however, that Parent or
the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to provide an indemnity or deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent
or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

        1.11 Exemption From Registration; California Permit. Parent and the
Company intend that the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
Section 1.6 in connection with the Merger will be issued in a transaction exempt
from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act"), by reason
of Section 3(a)(10) thereof or pursuant to Section 5.1(c). by reason of Section
4(2) of the Securities Act and SEC rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Subject to the provisions of Section 5.1(c), Parent and the Company intend that
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 in
connection with the Merger will be qualified under the California Code, pursuant
to Section 25121 thereof, after a fairness hearing has been held by the
Commissioner of Corporations of the State of California pursuant to the
authority granted by Section 25142 of such law (the "Fairness Hearing"), and (if
deemed necessary by Parent in its good faith judgment) the Fairness Hearing
shall also address the assumption by Parent of all Company Options, Company
Warrants and Company Stock Purchase Rights pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof. Each
of Parent and the Company shall use all requisite commercially reasonable
efforts (i) to file promptly following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, an application for issuance of a permit pursuant to Section 25121 of
the California Code to issue such securities and (if deemed necessary by Parent
in its good faith judgment) to assume such Company Options, Company Warrants and
Company Stock Purchase Rights (the "California Permit") and (ii) to obtain the
California Permit as promptly as practicable thereafter.

        1.12 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of



                                      -9-
<PAGE>   19

this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully
authorized to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

                                    ARTICLE 2

lease its Assets and Properties. The Company is duly qualified, licensed or
admitted to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership, use, licensing or leasing of its Assets and
Properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such qualification,
licensing or admission necessary, except for such failures to be so duly
qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing that could not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Business or Condition of
the Company. Section 2.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each
jurisdiction where the Company is so qualified, licensed or admitted to do
business and separately lists each other jurisdiction in which the Company owns,
uses, licenses or leases its Assets and Properties, or conducts business or has
employees or engages independent contractors.

        2.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Subject only to the requisite
approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company,
the Company has full corporate power to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company's Board of Directors has approved this
Agreement and declared its advisability. The execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement and the other agreements attached hereto as exhibits
(the "Ancillary Agreements") to which the Company is a party and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
and the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and thereunder,
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action by the Board of
Directors of the Company, and no other action on the part of the Board of
Directors of the Company is required to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Company
is a party and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. This Agreement and the



                                      -10-
<PAGE>   20

Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party have been or will be, as
applicable, duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and Merger Sub,
each constitutes or will constitute, as applicable, a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
and by general principles of equity.

        2.3 Capital Stock. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
only of 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock, no par value per share (the "Company
Common Stock"), of which 9,634,250 shares of Common Stock are issued and
outstanding as of the Amendment Date, and 11,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
no par value per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"). The Company is in the
process of increasing the authorized number of shares of Company Common Stock
from 30,000,000 to 100,000,000; and Parent hereby consents to such increase. The
designation and status of the Company Preferred Stock is as follows: (i)
2,000,000 shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock (the "Series A
Preferred Stock"), 1,776,333 of which are issued and outstanding as of the date
hereof, and (ii) 2,457,250 shares are designated as Series B Preferred Stock
(the "Series B Preferred Stock"), 1,695,503 of which are issued and outstanding
as of the date hereof. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and have been issued in compliance with all applicable federal,
state and foreign securities Laws. Except as set forth in Section 2.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock are held in treasury or are authorized or reserved for issuance
and no Options are outstanding. Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
lists the name and state of residence of each holder of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock provided to the Company by such holder. With respect to
any Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that has been issued subject
to a repurchase option on the part of the Company, Section 2.3 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the holder thereof, the number and type of
securities covered thereby, and the vesting schedule thereof (including a
description of the circumstances under which such vesting schedule can or will
be accelerated). Except as set forth in Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no outstanding Company Options, Company Warrants or Company
Stock Purchase Rights or agreements, arrangements or understandings to which the
Company is a party (written or oral) to issue any Options with respect to the
Company and there are no preemptive rights or agreements, arrangements or
understandings to issue preemptive rights with respect to the issuance or sale
of Company Capital Stock created by statute, the articles of incorporation or
by-laws of the Company, or any agreement or other arrangement to which the
Company is a party or to which it is bound and there are no agreements,
arrangements or understandings to which the Company is a party (written or oral)
pursuant to which the Company has the right to elect to satisfy any Liability by
issuing Company Common Stock or Equity Equivalents. With respect to each Company
Option, Company Warrant and Company Stock Purchase Right, Section 2.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the holder thereof, the number and type
of securities issuable thereunder, and, if applicable, the exercise price
therefor, the exercise period and vesting schedule thereof (including a
description of the circumstances under which such vesting schedule can



                                      -11-
<PAGE>   21

or will be accelerated). All of the Company Options, Company Warrants and
Company Stock Purchase Rights were issued in compliance with all applicable
federal, state and foreign securities Laws. The terms of the Company Stock
Option Plan and the applicable stock option agreements related to the
outstanding Company Options permit the assumption or substitution of options to
purchase Parent Common Stock as provided in this Agreement, without the consent
or approval of the holders of such securities, Company Shareholders' Action or
otherwise and without any acceleration of the exercise schedule or vesting
provisions in effect for those options. True and complete copies of all
agreements and instruments relating to or issued under the Company Stock Option
Plan have been provided to Parent and such agreements and instruments have not
been amended, modified or supplemented, and there are no agreements to amend,
modify or supplement such agreements or instruments in any case from the form
provided to Parent. Except for the Support Agreements, the Company is not a
party or subject to any agreement or understanding, and, to the Company's
knowledge, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between or among
any Persons which affects, restricts or relates to voting, giving of written
consents, dividend rights or transferability of shares with respect to the
Company Capital Stock, including without limitation any voting trust agreement
or proxy. Except as set forth in Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no debt securities of the Company are issued and outstanding. The fair market
value of the aggregate Merger consideration exceeds the amount set forth in
Section 6.2 of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation that would
otherwise permit the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock to
receive the special consideration set forth in such Section 6.2 and,
accordingly, Section 6.2 of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation is
inapplicable to the Merger.

        2.4 No Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 2.4 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company has no (and prior to the Closing will have no)
Subsidiaries and does not (and prior to the Closing will not) otherwise hold any
equity, membership, partnership, joint venture or other ownership interest in
any Person.

        2.5 Directors and Officers. The name of each director and officer of the
Company on the date hereof, and his or her position with the Company, are listed
in Section 2.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

        2.6 No Conflicts. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement does not, the performance by the Company of its obligations under this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not
and will not:

                (a) conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of the articles of incorporation or by-laws
of the Company;

Properties; or

Schedule and except as would not have a material adverse effect on the Business

party or by which any of the Company's Assets and Properties is bound.

stock record books and other similar records of the Company have been provided
or made available to Parent or its counsel prior to the execution of this
Agreement, are complete and correct in all respects and have been maintained in
accordance with sound business practices. Such minute books contain a true and
complete record of all actions taken at all meetings and by all written consents
in lieu of meetings of the directors, shareholders and committees of the Board
of Directors of the Company from the date of the Company's incorporation through
the date hereof. The Company has prior to the execution of this Agreement
delivered to Parent true and complete copies of its articles of incorporation
and by-laws, both as amended through the date hereof. The Company is not in

Schedule sets forth the Company Financials. The Company Financials delivered to
Parent are correct and complete in all material respects and have been prepared

adjustments, which adjustments will not be material in amount or significance
and except that the Interim Financial Statements may not contain footnotes.

respect to the Company or any affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or
similar group of which the Company is or was a member (a "Relevant Group") have
been duly and timely filed (including any extensions), and each such Tax Return
correctly and completely reflects Tax liability and all other information
required to be reported thereon. All Taxes due and payable by the Company or any
member of a Relevant Group, whether or not shown on any Tax Return, or claimed
to be due by any Tax Authority, have been paid or accrued on the balance sheet
included in the Company Financials or have otherwise been provided for as

                                      -18-

reserve as adjusted for operations and transactions in the ordinary course of

the same manner as any such reserves were computed at the Company's year end in
its most recent Audited Financial Statements.

                (c) The Company is not a party to any agreement extending the
time within which to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made in writing
by a Taxing Authority of any jurisdiction in which the Company or any member of
any Relevant Group does not file Tax Returns that the Company or such member is
or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

                (d) The Company and each member of any Relevant Group has
withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor or independent
contractor.

                (e) The Company does not have knowledge of any actions by any
Taxing Authority in connection with assessing additional Taxes against or in
respect of it or any Relevant Group for any past period. There is no dispute or
claim concerning any Tax liability of the Company either (i) threatened, claimed
or raised in writing by any Taxing Authority or (ii) of which the Company is
otherwise aware. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the Assets and Properties of
the Company other than Liens for Taxes not yet due. Section 2.11 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule indicates those Tax Returns, if any, of the Company and each
member of any Relevant Group that have been audited or examined by Taxing
Authorities, and indicates those Tax Returns of the Company and each member of
any Relevant Group that currently are the subject of audit or examination.
Solely with respect to Income Taxes, the Company has delivered to Parent
complete and correct copies of all federal, state, local and foreign income Tax
Returns filed by, and all Tax examination reports and statements of deficiencies
assessed against or agreed to by, the Company and each member of any Relevant
Group.

                (f) There are no outstanding agreements or waivers extending the
statutory period of limitation applicable to any Tax Returns required to be
filed by, or which include or are treated as including, the Company or with
respect to any Tax assessment or deficiency affecting the Company or any
Relevant Group.

                        (ii) there are no facts or circumstances known to the

relating to or affecting, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against, the Company or any of its Assets and Properties during the three-year
period prior to the date hereof.

        2.13 Compliance with Laws and Orders. Except as disclosed in Section
2.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not violated in any
material respect, and is not currently in material default under, any Law or
Order applicable to the Company or any of its Assets and Properties.

        2.14 Plans; ERISA.

                (a) Existence of Plans. Except as disclosed on Section 2.14 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates maintains or sponsors (or ever maintained
or sponsored), or makes or is required to make contributions to, any Plans, (ii)
none of the Plans is or was a "multi-employer plan", as defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA, (iii) none of the Plans is or was a "defined benefit pension plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA, (iv) none of the Plans provides or
provided post-retirement medical or health benefits, (v) none of the Plans is or
was a "welfare benefit fund," as defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, or an
organization described in Sections 501(c)(9) or 501(c)(20) of the Code, (vi)
neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
is or was a party to any collective bargaining agreement, and (vii) neither the
Company, any Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliate has
announced or otherwise made any commitment to create or amend any Plan, except
as may be required by changes in Law. Notwithstanding any statement or
indication in this Agreement to the contrary, other than its obligation to
provide required COBRA continuation coverage with respect to the Company's
medical plan, there are no Plans (a) as to which Parent will be required to make
any contributions or with respect to which Parent shall have any obligation or
liability whatsoever, whether on behalf of any of the current employees of the
Company or any Subsidiary or on behalf of any other person, after the Closing,
or (b) which Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary will not be
able to terminate immediately after the Closing in accordance with their terms
and ERISA. With respect to each of such Plans, at the Closing there will be no
unrecorded liabilities with respect to the establishment, implementation,
operation, administration or termination of any such Plan, or the termination of
the participation in any such Plan by the Company, any Subsidiary or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates. The Company has delivered to Parent true and
complete copies of: (i) each of the Plans and any related funding agreements
thereto (including insurance contracts) including all amendments, all of which
are legally valid and binding and in full force and effect and there are no
defaults thereunder, (ii) the currently effective Summary Plan Description
pertaining to each of the Plans, (iii) all annual reports for each of the Plans
(including all related schedules), (iv) the most recently filed PBGC Form 1 (if
applicable), (v) the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter,
opinion, notification or advisory letter (as the case may be) for each Plan
which is intended to constitute a qualified plan under Section 401 of the Code
and each amendment to each of the foregoing documents, and (vi) for each
unfunded Plan, financial statements consisting of (A) the consolidated statement
of assets and liabilities of such Plan as of its most recent valuation date, and
(B) the statement of changes in fund balance and in financial position or



                                      -21-
<PAGE>   31

the statement of changes in net assets available for benefits under such Plan
for the most recently-ended plan year, which such financial statements shall
fairly present the financial condition and the results of operations of such
Plan in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, as of such dates.

                (b) Present Value of Benefits. The present value of all accrued
benefits under any Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA shall not, as of the
Closing Date, exceed the value of the assets of such Plans allocated to such
accrued benefits, based upon the applicable provisions of the Code and ERISA,
and each such Plan shall be capable of being terminated as of the Closing Date
in a "standard termination" under Section 4041(b) of ERISA. With respect to each
Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, (i) no amount is due or owing from
the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates to the
PGBC or to any "multi-employer Plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA on
account of any withdrawal therefrom and (ii) no such Plan has been terminated
other than in accordance with ERISA or at a time when the Plan was not
sufficiently funded. The transactions contemplated hereunder, including without
limitation the termination of any Plan at or prior to the Closing, shall not
result in any such withdrawal or other liability under any applicable Laws.

                (c) Penalties; Reportable Events. Neither the Company, any
Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates is subject to any
material liability, tax or penalty whatsoever to any person or agency whomsoever
as a result of engaging in a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code, and
neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
has any knowledge of any circumstances which reasonably might result in any
material liability, tax or penalty, including but not limited to, a penalty
under Section 502 of ERISA, as a result of a breach of any duty under ERISA or
under other Laws. Each Plan which is required to comply with the provisions of
Sections 4980B and 4980C of the Code, or with the requirements referred to in
Section 4980D of the Code, has complied in all material respects. No event has
occurred which could subject any Plan to tax under Section 511 of the Code. None
of the Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA has, since September 2, 1974, been
completely or partially terminated nor has there been any "reportable event", as
such term is defined in Section 4043(b) of ERISA, with respect to any of the
Plans since the effective date of ERISA nor has any notice of intent to
terminate been filed or given with respect to any such Plan. There has been no
(i) withdrawal by the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates that is a substantial employer from a single-employer plan which is a
Plan and which has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are
not under common control, as referred to in Section 4063(b) of ERISA, or (ii)
cessation by the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates of operations at a facility causing more than 20% of Plan
participants to be separated from employment, as referred to in Section 4062(f)
of ERISA. Neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates, nor any other organization of which any of them are a successor or
Parent corporation as defined in Section 4069(b) of ERISA, have engaged in any
transaction described in Section 4069(a) of ERISA.

                (d) Deficiencies; Qualification. None of the Plans nor any trust
created thereunder has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" as such
term is defined in



                                      -22-
<PAGE>   32

Section 412 of the Code, whether or not waived, since the effective date of said
Section 412, and no condition has occurred or exists which by the passage of
time could be expected to result in an accumulated funding deficiency as of the
last day of the current plan year of any such Plan. Furthermore, neither the
Company, ant Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has any
unfunded liability under ERISA in respect of any of the Plans. Each of the Plans
which is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter, opinion, notification or advisory
letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and has in all material respects been
operated in accordance with its terms and with the provisions of the Code. All
of the Plans have been administered and maintained in substantial compliance
with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation is made by the Company concerning the impact of the
termination of the Company's 401(k) plan on such plan's continued qualification
under Section 401(a) of the Code. All contributions required to be made to each
of the Plans under the terms of that Plan, ERISA, the Code or any other
applicable Laws have been timely made. Each Plan intended to meet the
requirements for tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of the
Code is in compliance with such requirements. There are no Liens against the
property of the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates under Section 412(n) of the Code or Sections 302(f) or 4068 of ERISA.
The Interim Financial Statements properly reflect all amounts required to be
accrued as liabilities to date under each of the Plans.

                (e) Parachute Payments. There is no contract, agreement or
benefit arrangement covering any current or former employee or consultant of the
Company or any Subsidiary which, individually or collectively, could give rise
to the payment of any amount which would constitute an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G) of the Code). Neither the execution of
this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or further acts
or events) will (i) result in any obligation or liability (with respect to
accrued benefits or otherwise) on the part of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to the PBGC, to any Plan,
or to any present or former employee, director, officer, shareholder, contractor
or consultant of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any their respective
Subsidiaries or any of their dependents, (ii) be a trigger event under any Plan
that will result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming
due to any such present or former employee, officer, director, shareholder,
contractor, or consultant, or any of their dependents, or (iii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount, of any compensation
theretofore or thereafter due or granted to any employee, officer, director,
shareholder, contractor, or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary or any
of their dependents. With respect to any insurance policy which provides, or has
provided, funding for benefits under any Plan, (I) there is and will be no
liability of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in the
nature of a retroactive or retrospective rate adjustment, loss sharing
arrangement, or actual or contingent liability as of the Closing Date, nor would
there be any such liability if such insurance policy were terminated as of the
Closing Date, and (II) no insurance company issuing any such policy is in
receivership, conservatorship, bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such proceedings with respect to any
insurer are imminent.



                                      -23-
<PAGE>   33

                (f) COBRA. With respect to each Plan which provides health care
coverage, the Company and each ERISA Affiliate have complied in all material
respects with (i) the applicable health care continuation and notice provisions
of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended
("COBRA"), and the applicable COBRA regulations and (ii) the applicable
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
and the regulations thereunder, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has incurred any liability under Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code.

                (g) Litigation. Other than routine claims for benefits under the
Plans, there are no pending, or, to the best knowledge of the Company,
threatened, Actions or Proceedings involving the Plans, or the fiduciaries,
administrators, or trustees of any of the Plans or the Company, any Subsidiary
or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates as the employer or sponsor under any
Plan, with any of the IRS, the Department of Labor, the PBGC, any participant in
or beneficiary of any Plan or any other person whomsoever. The Company knows of
no reasonable basis for any such claim, lawsuit, dispute, action or controversy.

Real Property") and (ii) all Liens relating to or affecting any parcel of real

lease has been renewed) of the leases relating thereto. Each lease referred to
in clause (i) of paragraph (a) above is a legal, valid and binding agreement,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, of the Company and of each other
Person that is a party thereto, and except as set forth in Section 2.15(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no, and the Company has not received
notice of any, default (or any condition or event which, after notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default) thereunder. The Company does not
owe brokerage commissions or finders fees with respect to any such Leased Real
Property, except to the extent that the Company may renew the term of any such
lease, in which case, any such commissions and fees would be in amounts that are
reasonable and customary for the spaces so leased, given their intended use and
terms.

                (c) Except as disclosed in Section 2.15(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, all improvements on the Leased Real Property (i) comply

the Company, there are no condemnation or appropriation proceedings pending or

utilized, and/or operated (the "Lease Documents") have been delivered to Parent.
The Lease Documents are unmodified and in full force and effect, and there are
no other Contracts between the Company and any third parties, or by and among
any third parties, claiming an interest in the interest of the Company in the
Leased Real Property or otherwise relating to the use and occupancy of the
Leased Real Property.

        2.16 Tangible Personal Property. The Company is in possession of and has
good and marketable title to, or has valid leasehold interests in or valid
rights under Contract to use, all tangible personal property used in the conduct
of its business, including all tangible personal property reflected on the
Company Financials and tangible personal property acquired since the Audited
Financial Statement Date, other than property disposed of since such date in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Except as disclosed
in Section 2.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all such tangible personal
property is free and clear of all Liens and is adequate and suitable in all
material respects for the conduct by the Company of its business as presently
conducted, and is in good working order and condition in all material respects,
ordinary wear and tear excepted, and its use complies in all material respects
with all applicable Laws.

        2.17 Intellectual Property.

to assure that there shall be no material adverse change to its business or
electronic systems or material interruptions in the delivery of the Company's
products and services by reason of the advent of the year 2000, including,
without limitation, that all of its products (including products currently under
development) will, without interruption or manual intervention, continue to
consistently, predictably and accurately record, store, process, calculate and

calculate any information dependent on or relating to such dates in the same
manner, and with the same functionality, data integrity and performance, as such

before December 31, 1999, or calculate any information dependent on or relating

has taken all actions necessary and appropriate to ensure that the IT systems
and non-IT systems used by the Company in its internal operations will function
properly beyond 1999 (and the Company has no knowledge of any material issues

                                    ARTICLE 4
                       CONDUCT PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME

        4.1 Conduct of Business of the Company. During the period from April 21,
2000 and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the Company agrees (unless Parent shall give its prior
consent in writing which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) to carry on
its business in the usual, regular and ordinary course consistent in all
respects with the Company's 2000 operating plan provided to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement, to pay its Liabilities and Taxes consistent with the
Company's past practices (and in any event when due), to pay or perform other
obligations when due consistent with the Company's past practices (other than
Liabilities, Taxes and other obligations, if any, contested in good faith
through appropriate proceedings), and, to the extent consistent with such
business, to use reasonable efforts and institute all policies to preserve
intact its present business organization, keep available the services of its
present officers and key employees and preserve its relationships with
customers, suppliers, distributors, licensors, licensees, independent
contractors and other Persons having business dealings with it, all with the
express purpose and intent of preserving unimpaired its goodwill and ongoing
businesses at the Effective Time. Except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, take, or agree in writing or
otherwise to take, any of the actions described in Section 2.9 of this
Agreement, or any other action that would make any of its representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material
respect or prevent the Company from performing or cause the Company not to
perform its agreements and covenants hereunder. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, with respect to Section 2.9(j), any Options granted must have
an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the Company Common Stock
on the date



                                      -41-
<PAGE>   51

the Option was granted (as determined in good faith by the Company's board of
directors following consultation with, and consistent with the advice provided
by, each of the Company's and Parent's independent public accountants).

        4.2 No Solicitation. Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1
hereof, the Company will not take (and since April 23, 2000 inclusive has not
taken), nor will the Company (and since April 23, 2000 inclusive has not
permitted) permit any of the Company's officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, attorneys, investment advisors, agents, representatives,
Affiliates or Associates (collectively, "Representatives") to (directly or
indirectly), take any of the following actions with any Person other than Parent
and its designees: (a) solicit, encourage, initiate, entertain, accept receipt
of, substantively review or encourage any proposals or offers from, or
participate in or conduct discussions with or engage in negotiations with, any
Person relating to any offer or proposal, oral, written or otherwise, formal or
informal (a "Competing Proposed Transaction"), with respect to any possible
Business Combination with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether such
Subsidiaries are in existence on the date hereof or are hereafter organized),
(b) provide information with respect to the Company to any Person, other than
Parent, relating to (or which the Company believes would be used for the purpose
of formulating an offer or proposal with respect to), or otherwise assist,
cooperate with, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any such Person
with regard to, any possible Business Combination with the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company (whether such Subsidiaries are in existence on the
date hereof or are hereafter organized), (c) agree to, enter into a Contract
with any Person, other than Parent, providing for, or approve a Business
Combination with the Company or any Subsidiary (whether such Subsidiaries are in
existence on the date hereof or are hereafter organized), (d) make or authorize
any statement, recommendation, solicitation or endorsement in support of any
possible Business Combination with the Company or any Subsidiary (whether such
Subsidiary is in existence on the date hereof or are hereafter organized) other
than by Parent, or (e) authorize or permit any of the Company's Representatives
to take any such action. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any such contacts or negotiations with any Person relating to any
such transaction or Business Combination. In addition to the foregoing, if the
Company receives prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement any offer or proposal (formal or informal, oral, written or otherwise)
relating to, or any inquiry or contact from any Person with respect to, a
Competing Proposed Transaction, the Company shall immediately notify Parent
thereof and provide Parent with the details thereof, including the identity of
the Person or Persons making such offer or proposal, and will keep Parent fully
informed on a current basis of the status and details of any such offer or
proposal and of any modifications to the terms thereof; provided, however, that
this provision shall not in any way be deemed to limit the obligations of the
Company and its Representatives set forth in the previous sentence. Each of the
Company and Parent acknowledge that this Section 4.2 was a significant
inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement and the absence of such
provision would have resulted in either (i) a material reduction in the merger
consideration to be paid to the shareholders of the Company or (ii) a failure to
induce Parent to enter into this Agreement. This Section 4.2 shall not preclude
any shareholder of the Company from making decisions with respect to voting of
shares of Company Capital Stock.

the other such information concerning its business and financial statements and
affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel,
may be required or appropriate for inclusion in the Information Statement, or in
any amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to
cooperate with the other's counsel and auditors in the preparation of the
Information Statement. The Company will promptly advise Parent, and Parent will
promptly advise the Company, in writing if at any time prior to the Effective
Time either the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall obtain knowledge of any
facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the

by reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable law. The
Information Statement shall contain the recommendation of the Board of Directors
of the Company that the Company's shareholders approve the Merger and this

auditors in the preparation of the Permit Application. The Company will promptly

time prior to the Effective Time either the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate
to amend or supplement the Permit Application in order to make the statements
contained or incorporated by reference therein not misleading or to comply with
applicable law. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding,
Parent shall not include in the Permit Application any information with respect
to the Company or its affiliates or associates, the form and content of which

                (c) In the event that the California Permit cannot be obtained
in time to permit the Closing to occur on or before August 31, 2000, then, at
the Company's election, unless Parent shall certify to the Company that Parent
believes in good faith that the California Permit can be obtained within thirty
(30) days after such date and within such thirty day period the California
Permit is thereafter obtained, Parent and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 in a private placement pursuant to Section
4(2) of the Securities Act on terms and conditions that are reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Company. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that in such event: (i) as a condition to effecting such issuance as a private
placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, Parent shall be
entitled to obtain from each shareholder of the Company a Shareholder
Certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (or such other form as
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company) (the "Shareholder
Certificate") and that Parent will be relying upon the representations made by
each shareholder of the Company in the applicable Shareholder Certificate in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock to such shareholder, (ii) at
the Closing, Parent shall execute and deliver a backup registration rights
agreement (the "Backup Registration Rights Agreement") granting Form S-3
registration rights with respect to the shares subject to terms, condition,
limitations, blackout periods and postponement rights (as reasonably desired by
Parent to accommodate other potential acquisitions and significant corporate
developments) reasonably acceptable to the parties; (iii) the shares of Parent
Common Stock so issued pursuant to Section 1.6 will not be registered under the
Securities Act and will constitute "restricted securities" within the meaning of
the Securities Act; and (iv) the certificates representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock shall bear appropriate legends to identify such privately placed
shares as being restricted under the Securities Act, to comply with applicable
state securities laws and, if applicable, to notice the restrictions on transfer
of such shares; and (v) notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary,
the Backup Registration Rights Agreement shall contain terms and conditions
which are at least as favorable to the Company's shareholders as the terms and
conditions contained in and otherwise applicable to the Backup Rights
Registration Agreement entered into between Parent and the shareholders of
HotHaus Technologies Inc., a British Columbia corporation.

and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance of the California Permit, the
Company shall give written notice of this Agreement and the proposed Merger to
all Company shareholders and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
all other action necessary in accordance with the California Code and its
articles of incorporation and bylaws to convene a meeting of its shareholders or
secure the written consent of its shareholders with respect to the Company
Shareholder Action before August 30, 2000. The Company shall submit this
Agreement to its shareholders for adoption whether or not the Company's Board of
Directors determines at any time subsequent to declaring its advisability that
this Agreement is no longer advisable and recommends that the shareholders
reject it. The Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date of any
shareholder meeting with respect to the Company Shareholder Action and shall not
postpone or adjourn (other than for the absence of a quorum) any such meeting,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts required to solicit and obtain from shareholders
of the Company proxies or written consents in favor of the Merger and this

vote or consent of shareholders of the Company required with respect to the
Merger. The materials submitted to the shareholders of the Company in respect of
the Merger shall have been subject to prior review and comment by Parent and
shall include (a) information regarding the Company, the terms of the Merger and
this Agreement, (b) the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company
that the Company's shareholders approve the Merger and this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and approve and execute such other documents as
may be required to satisfy the applicable requirements of the Securities Act in

implementation by Parent and the Surviving Corporation following the Effective
Time; provided, however, that no investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein. Materials furnished to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.3 may
be used by Parent for strategic and integration planning purposes relating to
accomplishing the transactions contemplated hereby.

        5.4 Confidentiality. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees to keep
the existence and terms of this Agreement (except to the extent contemplated
hereby) and such information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant
to Section 5.3, or pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement

have provided the other party with prior notice of such order and an opportunity
to object or seek a protective order and take any other available action) or (f)

Action or Proceeding between any of the parties hereto. The parties acknowledge
that Parent and the Company have previously executed a confidentiality agreement
dated March 15, 1999 (as amended, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms. Without limiting the foregoing, all information furnished to
Parent and its officers, employees, accountants and counsel by the Company, and
all information furnished to the Company by Parent and its officers, employees,
accountants and counsel, shall be covered by the Confidentiality Agreement, and
Parent and the Company shall be fully liable and responsible under the

transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the obligation of the respective
party incurring such fees and expenses. Parent shall have the right to approve
Third Party Expenses to be incurred by the Company between the date hereof and

required by Law (including federal and state securities laws) or, as to Parent,
by the rules and regulations of the NASD, prior to the Effective Time, no
disclosure (whether or not in response to any inquiry) of the existence of any
subject matter of, or the terms and conditions of, this Agreement shall be made
by any party hereto unless approved by Parent and the Company prior to release;
provided, however, that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) each of Parent and the Company shall
be permitted to disclose the existence of this Agreement in confidence to its
customers, suppliers and sales representatives with whom it has non-disclosure
agreements that apply to such disclosure (or the other party otherwise agrees to
such disclosure) and for which there is a business reason for the disclosure;
and (ii) the parties shall issue a joint press release announcing this Agreement
before 3:00 p.m., California time, on the first business day after the
expiration of the due diligence period.

        5.7 Approvals. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all Approvals from Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or under any of
the Contracts or other agreements as may be required in connection with the
Merger (all of such



                                      -46-
<PAGE>   56

Approvals are set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule or described in this
Agreement) so as to preserve all rights of and benefits to the Company
thereunder and Parent shall provide the Company with such assistance and
information as is reasonably required to obtain such Approvals. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Approvals from Governmental or
Regulatory Authorities (all of such Approvals are set forth in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule or described in this Agreement) as may be required in
connection with the Merger and the Company shall provide Parent with such
assistance and information as is reasonably required to obtain such Approvals.

        5.8 FIRPTA Compliance. Within thirty days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a properly executed statement in a form prepared
by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company for purposes of satisfying
Parent's obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

        5.9 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub, respectively, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate at or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) any failure of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.9 shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the
party receiving such notice.

        5.10 [Intentionally Omitted].

        5.11 [Intentionally Omitted]

        5.12 [Intentionally Omitted]

        5.13 Additional Documents and Further Assurances. Each party hereto, at
the request of the other party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things (including, but not
limited to, all action reasonably necessary to seek and obtain any and all
consents and approvals of any Government or Regulatory Authority or Person
required in connection with the Merger; provided, however, that Parent shall not
be obligated to consent to any divestitures or operational limitations or
activities in connection therewith and no party shall be obligated to make a
payment of money as a condition to obtaining any such condition or approval) as
may be reasonably necessary or desirable for effecting completely the
consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

        5.14 Indemnification. Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation
agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of
the employees, agents, directors or officers of the Company (the "Company
Indemnified Parties") as provided in its articles of incorporation or bylaws or
indemnification agreements as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from
the Closing Date, assuming the consummation of the Merger; provided, however,
that, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year



                                      -47-
<PAGE>   57

period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims
shall continue to disposition of any and all such claims. Any determination
required to be made with respect to whether a Company Indemnified Party's
conduct complies with the standards set forth in the articles of incorporation
or bylaws or indemnification agreements of the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise shall be made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving
Corporation reasonably satisfactory to the Company Indemnified Party (whose fees
and expenses shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation), which such
determination shall be final and binding on the parties thereto. The Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent that no claim for indemnification has
been made by any director or officer of the Company and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no basis exists for any such claim for indemnification. Parent
unconditionally guarantees the Surviving Company's payment and other obligations
provided for in this Section 5.14.

        5.15 Form S-8. Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company
Options promptly (and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days) after the
Effective Time to the extent the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Company Options qualify for registration on Form S-8 and Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
relating thereto) for so long as such Company Options remain outstanding.

        5.16 NNM Listing of Additional Shares. Parent shall, to the extent
required by the rules of the NNM, notify the NNM of the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued, and the shares of Parent Common Stock required to be
reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger, it being understood that
under current NNM and SEC rules, no additional listing application needs to be
filed by Parent.

        5.17 Company's Auditors. The Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its management and its independent auditors to facilitate on a
timely basis (i) the preparation of financial statements (including pro forma
financial statements if required) as required by Parent to comply with
applicable SEC regulations, (ii) the review of any Company audit or review work
papers, including the examination of selected interim financial statements and
data, (iii) the delivery of such representations from the Company's independent
accountants as may be reasonably requested by Parent or its accountants, and
(iv) the securing of a binding fee commitment (on terms similar to those in
place on the date of this Agreement) with respect to consents and comfort
letters requested by Parent after the Closing.

        5.18 Termination of 401(k) Plans. Upon the request of Parent, the Board
of Directors of the Company, and of any Subsidiary, shall adopt resolutions
terminating, effective as of the day before the Closing Date, any Plan which is
intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code, and which is
sponsored, or contributed to, by the Company or any Subsidiary. At the Closing,
the Company shall provide Parent (i) executed resolutions of the Board of
Directors of the Company authorizing such termination and (ii) if required, an
executed amendment to the 401(k) Plan in the form requested by Parent sufficient
to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the



                                      -48-
<PAGE>   58

Code and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the 401(k)
Plan will be maintained at the time of termination.

        5.19 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Board of Directors of
the Company will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

        5.20 [Intentionally Omitted]

        5.21 Treatment as Reorganization. Neither Parent nor the Company shall
knowingly take any action prior to or following the Closing that would cause the
merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, including, but not limited to, any change
in the form of the Merger pursuant to Section 5.24 or any post-Closing merger or
liquidation of the Company that would cause the Merger to so fail to qualify.

        5.22 Company Repurchases. The Company will exercise any rights that
mature between the date hereof and the Effective Time to repurchase any
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock at the price at which such shares
were issued.

        5.23 Information Technology Access. In furtherance of the Company's
agreement in Section 5.3 and to facilitate prompt integration following the
Closing of the Company's information technology ("IT") inventory (e.g., voice
and data network services and software and hardware, licenses,
financial/accounting software, IT budgets, etc.) with Parent's, the Company will
provide Parent and its Representatives with access to the Company's IT
inventory, as well as the Company's personnel responsible for such IT inventory.
Because of the substantial lead time that may be required to order and install
new software and hardware to integrate the Company's IT systems with Parent's,
and the importance of a smooth integration of such IT systems promptly after the
Closing, the Company agrees that Parent may order, either in Parent's name or
the Company's name, any new IT services, hardware and software that Parent
believes will be needed at the Company's facilities in order to integrate
Parent's and the Company's respective operations following the Closing. The
Company will cooperate with Parent in the installation of such IT systems,
hardware and software prior to and in anticipation of the Closing, including,
but not limited to, providing Parent with reasonable access to and use of the
Company's appropriate personnel. If necessary, at Parent's request, the Company
will place IT systems, hardware and software orders in the Company's name. For
clarity, it is the parties' intent not to connect any of the ordered services or
systems prior to the Closing. Parent and the Company agree to cooperate with
each other to minimize any potential disruption to the Company's business from
the IT integration efforts; provided, however, that Parent will not have any
liability to the Company for any such disruption or as may otherwise result from
the IT integration efforts, except as may be directly caused by Parent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct; and provided further that in no event will
Parent have any liability to the Company for any indirect, incidental,
consequential, special or speculative damages, including, but not limited to,
damages for loss of profits or use, business interruption or loss of goodwill,
irrespective



                                      -49-
<PAGE>   59

of whether such damages arise under contract, tort, statute or otherwise and
whether or not the Company has given Parent advance notice of the possibility of
such damages. If the Closing does not occur, other than because of the Company's
breach of the Merger Agreement, Parent will reimburse the Company for its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by it in connection with
the ordering and installation of IT services, hardware and software. If Parent
is so required to reimburse the Company, Parent will own any such hardware and
software and will pay for its removal from Company premises. Parent and the
Company will cooperate in the removal of any such hardware or software so as to
minimize any disruption to the Company's business. In addition, if the Closing
does not occur, the Company will cooperate with Parent in canceling any orders
for IT services, hardware or software and will otherwise act to minimize the
costs which might be incurred in connection with the IT integration efforts.

        5.24 Change of Merger Form. The Company agrees that in the event Parent
requests at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing that the
transactions contemplated hereby be effected through a different form of merger
(limited to a forward merger qualifying under Code Section 368(a)(1)(A)) than
the form presently contemplated herein, and provided that the alternative form
of merger is in any event intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization in
the opinion of counsel to Parent and the Company, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent in effecting the alternative form of merger and will take all
reasonably necessary action towards such end, including, but not limited to the
execution of any amendments to this Agreement (provided such amendments relate
only to the alternative form of merger and any related matters and do not
include any other substantive changes not otherwise agreed between the parties).
The Company shall not be responsible for any Other Tax imposed on the Company,
including, but not limited to, any sales or use or other transfer Tax, resulting
from Parent's determination to change the form of the Merger.

        5.25 Due Diligence. The Company acknowledges that, as of the date of
this Agreement, Parent has not yet received all of the due diligence materials
it has requested with respect to the Company and its operations, nor has Parent
had sufficient opportunity to complete its review of the due diligence materials
provided to date by the Company. The Company agrees that it will continue to
promptly provide requested due diligence materials to Parent and (as
contemplated by Section 5.3) provide Parent with reasonable access to its
facilities, Books and Records and personnel for the purpose of permitting Parent
to complete its due diligence review. Parent agrees that it will use
commercially reasonable efforts to complete its due diligence review of the
Company as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than the earlier of:
(i) fourteen days after receipt of all material due diligence materials
requested by Parent from the Company (including any supplementary materials
requested by Parent as a result of its review of any of the due diligence
materials provided by the Company); and (ii) 11:59 p.m. California time, on July
30, 2000.

        5.26 Intellectual Property. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
that any Person shall have (i) commenced, or shall have notified the Company
that it intends to commence, an Action or Proceeding or (ii) provided the
Company with notice, in either case which allege(s) that any of the Intellectual
Property, including the Company Intellectual Property, presently embodied, or
proposed to be embodied, in the Company's products or



                                      -50-
<PAGE>   60

utilized in Company-designed or modified development tools (including standard
cells) or design environments infringes or otherwise violates the intellectual
property rights of such Person, is available for licensing from a potential
licensor providing the notice or otherwise alleges that the Company does not
otherwise own or have the right to exploit such Intellectual Property, including
the Company Intellectual Property. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in
making arrangements, prior to the Closing Date, satisfactory to Parent in its
sole discretion to effect the assignment to the Company of all Intellectual
Property created by the Company's founders, employees and consultants, including
certain Intellectual Property created by the Company's founders prior to the
Company's incorporation, and to obtain the cooperation of such Persons to
complete all appropriate patent filings related thereto. The Company shall take
commercially reasonable actions to maintain, perfect, preserve or renew the
Company Registered Intellectual Property, including, without limitation, the
payment of any registration, maintenance, renewal fees, annuity fees and taxes
or the filing of any documents, applications or certificates related thereto,
and to promptly respond and prepare to respond to all requests, related to the
Company Registered Intellectual Property, received from Governmental or
Regulatory Authorities. At the Closing, the Company will notify Parent of all
material actions which must be taken within the 180 days following the Closing
Date and which are necessary to maintain, perfect, preserve or renew the Company
Registered Intellectual Property, including the payment of any registration,
maintenance, renewal fees, annuity fees and taxes or the filing of any
documents, applications or certificates related thereto.

        5.27 Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that
the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company in connection with the
execution and delivery of the Original Agreement was in draft form. The
definitive Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company concurrently
herewith supercedes the draft Company Disclosure Schedule delivered as of the
date of the Original Agreement and constitutes the "Company Disclosure Schedule"
for all purposes of this Agreement.

        5.28 Inclusion in Parent Plans. Parent shall, to the extent permitted by
Parent's various benefit plans, promptly following the Closing include all of
the Company's employees in Parent's employee benefit plans, including its
medical, equity, stock option, profit sharing, retirement, 401(k), dental, or
other similar welfare or retirement plans. Each such Company employee shall
receive full credit for prior service rendered to the Company for purposes of
eligibility and vesting in employee benefits plans maintained by Parent and for
purposes of vacation, sick leave and other benefits in which the amount of an
employee's benefits is dependent upon length of service and with full credit for
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses for the current year
(subject in all cases to any limitations contained in any applicable plan) and
with full credit; provided, however, that no such prior service credit shall
apply with respect to the vesting schedule of options or other similar incentive
awards granted by Parent to such Company employees.

        5.29 Certain Agreements. Schedule 5.29 sets forth those individuals and
entities who have not, as of the date hereof, executed a Support Agreement
Reaffirmation. The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain executed copies of such an agreement from individuals and entities
sufficient to satisfy the voting requirement set forth in Section 2.32(d) as
soon as practicable and in any event no later than August 4, 2000.



                                      -51-
<PAGE>   61

Parent acknowledges that it has received all executed agreements required under
Section 8.1(k).

        5.30 Adjustment of Aggregate Share Number. The parties acknowledge that
the Company intends to issue Company Options to new employees of the Company in
the ordinary course of business between the Amendment Date and the Closing Date.
Parent and the Company acknowledge that the Aggregate Share Number will be
increased in accordance with Schedule 5.30 as necessary to directly offset the
dilutive effect of grants of Company Options to Company employees newly hired
between the Amendment Date and the Closing and certain other matters. The
Company agrees that it will seek Parent's prior written approval of any grant of
Company Options to any new employee, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, subject to Schedule 5.30. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 5.30 to the contrary, no adjustment to the Aggregate Share Number shall
be made for any grant of Company Options by the Company which Parent has not
approved in writing. In no event will the Closing be delayed, postponed or
affected if there is a dispute between the Company and Parent as to whether the
Aggregate Share Number is required to be increased pursuant to this section. If
any such dispute cannot be resolved before the Closing, such dispute will be
resolved post-Closing by Parent and the Shareholder Agent pursuant to the
dispute resolution provisions of this Agreement.

        5.31 Acceleration of Vesting; Designated Employee. The parties shall
provide for a mechanism that provides for the following upon consummation of the
Merger with respect to each employee of the Company designated by the Company
prior to the Closing Date (the "Designated Employees") and each Company Option
issued to such Designated Employees prior to the Closing Date (the "Designated
Stock Options"): In the event that a Designated Employee is terminated by the
Company or Parent without Cause within one year after the Closing Date, then the
vesting of the shares of Parent Common Stock covered by the Designated Stock
Options of such Designated Employee shall accelerate by one year effective as of
the date of such termination. Prior to the Closing, the Company and each
Designated Employee will enter into an appropriate amendment (which shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of Parent) to the applicable Designated Stock
Options in accordance with this Section.

                                    ARTICLE 6

                (c) Tax Opinions. Parent and the Company shall each have
received written opinions from their counsel, in form and substance reasonably

                (l) Termination of Pension Plan. If requested by Parent in
writing at least ten (10) business days prior to Closing, the Company shall,
immediately prior to the Closing Date, have terminated the Company 401(k) Plan
and no further contributions shall have been made to the 401(k) Plan. The
Company shall have provided to Parent (i) executed resolutions of the Board of
Directors of the Company authorizing the termination and (ii) an executed
amendment to the 401(k) Plan sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder so that the
tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan will be maintained at the time of
termination.

                (m) Employees. The employees of the Company set forth on
Schedule 6.3(m) shall continue to be employed by the Company at the Closing (and
shall not have given any notice or other indication that they are not willing to
be employed by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent (as Parent shall designate),
following the Merger. At least ninety percent (90%) of the other engineering and
research and development employees of the Company employed as of the date of
this Agreement shall continue to be employed by the Company at the Closing and
shall not have given any notice or other indication, that they are not willing
to be employed by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent (as Parent shall designate)
following the Merger. Any one (but not more than one) Company employee who
ceases to be employed by the Company as a result of death or bona fide permanent
disability will be excluded from the numerator and the denominator in
calculating such percentage.

                (n) Assignment of Intellectual Property. Arrangements
satisfactory to Parent in its sole discretion shall have been made to effect the
assignment to the Company of all Intellectual Property created by the Company's
founders, employees and consultants, including certain Intellectual Property
created by the Company's founders prior to the Company's incorporation, and to
obtain the cooperation of such Persons to complete all appropriate U.S. and
foreign patent filings related thereto.

                (o) Repurchase Agreement. Stewart Wu shall have executed and
delivered to Parent a Stock Repurchase Agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit L (or Parent and Stewart Wu shall have executed a
similar agreement with such changes thereto as have been agreed upon by both
parties in each party's sole and absolute discretion), and such Stock Repurchase
Agreement shall be in full force and effect.

                (p) Intentional Material Misrepresentation: The Company shall
not have committed any material fraud in connection with this Agreement, made
any intentional material misrepresentation to Parent constituting fraud, or
committed any other intentional material breach of this Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE 7
             SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND
                          AGREEMENTS; ESCROW PROVISIONS

        7.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements.
Notwithstanding any right of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (whether or not
exercised) to investigate the affairs of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
(whether pursuant to Section 5.3 or otherwise) or a waiver by Parent or the
Company of any condition to Closing



                                      -56-
<PAGE>   66

set forth in Article 6, each party shall have the right to rely fully upon the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the other party
contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement. Except for (i) the covenant contained in Section 5.14 (which shall
survive for the period set forth therein) and (ii) Article 7 (which shall
survive until termination of the escrow created thereby and the satisfaction of
any other obligations described therein), (x) all of the representations and
warranties of the Company in this Agreement relating to the IP Claims shall
survive until the IP Expiration Date and (y) all of the other representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company and Parent and Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Merger and continue until the first anniversary of
the Closing Date (the "General Expiration Date").

        7.2 Escrow Provisions.

                (a) Establishment of the Escrow Fund. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount, without any act of any shareholder,
will be deposited with the Depositary Agent (plus a proportionate share of any
additional shares of Parent Common Stock as may be issued upon any stock splits,
stock dividends or recapitalizations effected by Parent following the Effective
Time), such deposit to constitute the "Escrow Fund" to be governed by the terms
set forth herein. The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each
shareholder of the Company shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled
under Section 1.6(a). Notwithstanding the references in this Agreement to the
"escrow" and the Escrow Fund, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
Depositary Agent is acting as a depository and not as an escrow agent pursuant
to this Article 7.

                (b) Recourse to the Escrow Fund. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the IP Escrow Amount shall be available to compensate Parent
and its officers, directors, employees, agents, Affiliates and Associates (the
"Parent Indemnitees") for any and all payments and disbursements made by any of
the Parent Indemnitees (including attorneys' fees and other expenses of
litigation, and amounts paid in settlement), directly or indirectly, as a result
of IP Claims ("IP Losses"). The term "IP Losses" shall not include any expenses
of litigation which relate to any of the IP Claims and which are incurred prior
to the Closing Date and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no Officer's Certificate may be submitted to the Depository
Agent for any expenses of litigation which relate to any of the IP Claims and
which are incurred prior to the Closing Date. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the General Escrow Amount shall be available to compensate
the Parent Indemnitees for any and all Losses (whether or not involving a Third
Party Claim), including IP Losses, incurred or sustained by any of the Parent
Indemnitees, directly or indirectly, either as a result of (i) any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company
contained herein or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
(ii) any IP Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may not make any claims
against the Escrow Fund unless the aggregate Losses incurred or sustained exceed
$300,000 (at which such time claims may be made for all Losses incurred or
sustained).

                        (i) Basic Amount Recoverable: The amount of payments and
disbursements recoverable from the Escrow Fund with respect to any IP Losses
shall be



                                      -57-
<PAGE>   67

determined on the following basis: (x) in the case of litigation expenses
incurred after the Closing Date with respect to the IP Claims (including
expenses in connection with threatened litigation), the actual amount of such
litigation expenses which are paid; (y) in the case of any payments made to
third parties in settlement of any IP Claims (including, but not limited to, any
lump-sum payment, prepaid license, technology acquisition costs or periodic
royalties), the actual amount of such payments which are made; and (z) in the
case of any judgments with respect to the IP Claims, the actual amount of such
judgments which are paid to third parties. It is agreed that any Losses that
Parent or the other Parent Indemnities may incur with respect to the IP Claims
will be offset by: (1) any payments that Parent or the Company receives from
Accton Technology Corporation ("Accton") that are specifically identified by
Accton as being made toward the legal fees or damages incurred by Parent or the
Company in connection with the IP Claims; or (2) the amount of any royalties
otherwise due from the Company to Accton that are withheld from payment to
Accton (with Accton's concurrence) in lieu of a payment from Accton towards such
legal fees or damages.

                        (ii) Treatment of Bundled Claims: In the event of
payments and disbursements relating both to the IP Claims and to other claims,
then only that portion of the payments and disbursements which is reasonably
allocable to the IP Claim shall be recoverable from the Escrow Fund as IP
Losses, and the remainder of such payments and disbursements shall not be
recoverable from the Escrow Fund unless an independent basis for recovery of
such amounts from the Escrow Fund exists (that is, unless such payments and
disbursements would otherwise constitute Losses for which Parent would be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article 7).

                        (iii) Treatment of Bundled Products: In the event that
any payments and disbursements relate to products of Parent incorporating
Company Intellectual Property, then no such payments and disbursements shall be
recoverable from the Escrow Fund.

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each acknowledge that such Losses, if any,
would relate to unresolved contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which
if resolved at the Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the aggregate
Merger consideration to be paid to the shareholders of the Company. The
shareholders of the Company shall not have any liability under this Agreement of
any sort whatsoever in excess of the Escrow Fund, except in the event of fraud
or willful misconduct (i.e., an intentional breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, but excluding a negligent or reckless breach)
by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, agreements or
covenants contained herein or in any other instrument or document required to be
delivered pursuant to this Agreement in connection herewith. In the event of
such a fraudulent breach, Parent shall have all remedies available at law or in
equity (including for tort) with respect to such breach; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall any shareholder of the Company have any liability in excess of
the Merger consideration received by such shareholder in connection with the
Merger or the proceeds, if any, received by such shareholder in connection with
the disposition of such Merger consideration.

                (c) Escrow Period; Distribution of Escrow Fund upon Termination
of Escrow Period. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall
be in



                                      -58-
<PAGE>   68

existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00
p.m., Pacific Time, on the General Expiration Date (with respect to the General
Escrow Amount) and on the IP Expiration Date (with respect to the IP Escrow
Amount) (the period of time from the Effective Time through and including the
applicable expiration date is referred to herein as the "Escrow Period"); and
all shares of Parent Common Stock remaining in the Escrow Fund shall be
distributed as set forth below in this Section 7.2(c); provided, however, that
the applicable Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to such amount (or
some portion thereof) that is necessary in the reasonable judgment of Parent,
subject to the objection of the Shareholder Agent and the subsequent arbitration
of the matter in the manner as provided in Section 7.2(g) hereof, to satisfy any
unsatisfied claims under this Section 7.2 concerning facts and circumstances
existing prior to the termination of such applicable Escrow Period which claims
are specified in any Officer's Certificate delivered to the Depositary Agent
prior to termination of such applicable Escrow Period. As soon as all such
claims, if any, have been resolved, the Depositary Agent shall deliver to the
shareholders of the Company the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not
required to satisfy such claims. Deliveries of shares of Parent Common Stock
remaining in the Escrow Fund to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to this
Section 7.2(c) shall be made ratably in proportion to their respective
contributions to the Escrow Fund. Each shareholder of the Company who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such
holder) shall be entitled to receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to
the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (a) such fraction, multiplied by
(b) the Closing Price. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
have such shares delivered as promptly as practicable after such resolution.
Parent may at any time prior to the first release of any portion of the General
Escrow Amount to the Company shareholders determine whether a claim which it may
make against either the General Escrow Amount or the IP Escrow Amount shall be
settled from the General Escrow Amount or the IP Escrow Amount and, if
previously settled from one of the escrow amounts, may prior to such release
cause a reallocation between the escrow amounts to reflect such determination.
For purpose of clarity, at the expiration of the Escrow Period relating to the
General Escrow Amount, only such remaining portion of the Escrow Fund which
relates to the General Escrow Amount shall be available for distribution to the
Company's shareholders, while the portion of the Escrow Fund which relates to
the IP Escrow Amount shall remain in the escrow.

                (d) Protection of Escrow Fund.

                        (i) The Depositary Agent shall hold and safeguard the
Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent
and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms
hereof.

                        (ii) Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other Equity
Equivalents securities issued or distributed by Parent ("New Shares") in respect
of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund which have not been released from the
Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund. New Shares issued in respect of
shares of Parent Common Stock which have been released from the Escrow Fund
shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the record
holders thereof. Cash dividends on



                                      -59-
<PAGE>   69

Parent Common Stock shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be
distributed to the record holders of the Parent Common Stock on the record date
set for any such dividend.

                        (iii) Each shareholder shall have voting rights with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund by
such shareholder (and on any voting securities added to the Escrow Fund in
respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock).

                (e) Claims Upon Escrow Fund.

                        (i) Upon receipt by the Depositary Agent at any time on
or before the last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any
officer of Parent (an "Officer's Certificate"): (A) stating that Parent (or
another Parent Indemnitee) has paid or properly accrued or reasonably
anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue Losses, directly or indirectly,
as a result of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company contained herein or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (B) specifying in reasonable detail the
individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such
item was paid or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability,
and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, agreement or
covenant to which such item is related, the Depositary Agent shall, subject to
the provisions of Section 7.2(f) hereof, deliver to Parent out of the Escrow
Fund, as promptly as practicable, shares of Parent Common Stock held in the
Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such Losses, and (C) subject to Parent's
rights under Section 7.2(c), specifying whether such Losses should be settled
against the General Escrow Amount or the IP Escrow Amount. Where the basis for a
claim upon the Escrow Fund by Parent is that Parent reasonably anticipates that
it will pay or accrue a Loss, no payment will be made from the Escrow Fund for
such Loss unless and until such Loss is actually paid or accrued.

                        (ii) For the purposes of determining the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to Parent out of the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 7.2(e)(i), the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be valued
at the Closing Price.

                (f) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any
Officer's Certificate to the Depositary Agent, a duplicate copy of such
certificate shall be delivered to the Shareholder Agent and for a period of
thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Depositary Agent shall make no
delivery to Parent of any Escrow Amounts pursuant to Section 7.2(e) hereof
unless the Depositary Agent shall have received written authorization from the
Shareholder Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration of such 30 day
period, the Depositary Agent shall make delivery of shares of Parent Common
Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 7.2(e) hereof, provided
that no such payment or delivery may be made if the Shareholder Agent shall
object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate,
and such statement shall have been delivered to the Depositary Agent prior to
the expiration of such 30 day period.



                                      -60-

                (g) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

                        (i) In case the Shareholder Agent shall object in
writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate, the
Shareholder Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Shareholder Agent and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to
the Depositary Agent. The Depositary Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and distribute shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms thereof.

                        (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiation, either Parent or the Shareholder Agent may demand arbitration
of the dispute unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in a pending
Action or Proceeding involving a Third Party Claim, in which event arbitration
shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration; and in either event the matter shall be settled by arbitration
conducted by three (3) arbitrators, one (1) selected by Parent and one (1)
selected by the Shareholder Agent, and the two (2) arbitrators selected by
Parent and the Shareholder Agent shall select a third arbitrator. The
arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to
reduce the cost and time for discovery of information relating to any dispute
while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate as determined in the sole
judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the opposing
parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon
motions to compel, limit or allow discovery as they shall deem appropriate given
the nature and extent of the disputed claim. The arbitrators shall also have the
authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys' fees and other costs
incurred by the parties, to the same extent as a court of law or equity, should
the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to by a party without
substantial justification. The decision of a majority of the three (3)
arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's
Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement,
and notwithstanding anything in Section 7.2(f) hereof, the Depositary Agent
shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold
payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Such decision shall be
written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions
regarding the dispute which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order
awarded by the arbitrators.

                        (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any such
arbitration shall be held in the city and county of Los Angeles, California
under the commercial rules of arbitration then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association. For purposes of this Section 7.2(g), in any arbitration
hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Officer's
Certificate is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party
in the event that the arbitrators award Parent less than the sum of one-half
(1/2) of the disputed amount of any Losses plus any amounts not in dispute;
otherwise, the shareholders of the Company as represented by the Shareholder
Agent shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party. The Non-Prevailing Party
to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each



                                      -61-
<PAGE>   71

arbitrator, the administrative costs of the arbitration and the expenses,
including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by
the other party to the arbitration.

                (h) Shareholder Agent of the Shareholders; Power of Attorney.

                        (i) In the event that the Merger is approved by the
shareholders of the Company, effective upon such vote, and without further act
of any shareholder, Alan B. Grebene shall be appointed as agent and
attorney-in-fact (the "Shareholder Agent") for each shareholder of the Company
(except such shareholders, if any, as shall have perfected their appraisal or
dissenters' rights under the California Code), for and on behalf of shareholders
of the Company, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
delivery to Parent of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such deliveries, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and
comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such
claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Shareholder Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be
changed by the shareholders of the Company from time to time upon not less than
thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; provided, however, that the
Shareholder Agent may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest in
the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted
Shareholder Agent. Any vacancy in the position of Shareholder Agent may be
filled by approval of the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund.
No bond shall be required of the Shareholder Agent, and the Shareholder Agent
shall not receive compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or
from the Shareholder Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
shareholders of the Company.

                        (ii) The Shareholder Agent shall not be liable for any
act done or omitted hereunder as Shareholder Agent while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment.

                        (iii) The Shareholder Agent shall have reasonable access
to information about the Company and the reasonable assistance of the Company's
officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its
rights hereunder, provided that the Shareholder Agent shall treat confidentially
and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Company to anyone
(except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree in writing to treat
such information confidentially).

                (i) Actions of the Shareholder Agent. A decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Shareholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all the
shareholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to them
are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each of such shareholders, and the Depositary Agent and Parent may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Agent as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of every such shareholder of the Company.
The Depositary Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any
person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Shareholder Agent.



                                      -62-
<PAGE>   72

                (j) Third-Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a
third-party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably expects may
result in a demand against the Escrow Fund, Parent shall notify the Shareholder
Agent of such claim, and the Shareholder Agent, as representative for the
shareholders of the Company, shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate
in any defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion
to settle any Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if Parent settles any
Third Party Claim without the Shareholder Agent's consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Parent may not make a claim against
the Escrow Fund with respect to the amount of Losses incurred by Parent in such
settlement. In the event that the Shareholder Agent has consented to any such
settlement, the Shareholder Agent shall have no power or authority to object
under any provision of this Article 7 to the amount of any claim by Parent
against the Escrow Fund with respect to the amount of Losses incurred by Parent
in such settlement (but such consent, by itself, shall not constitute agreement
that Parent is entitled to indemnification hereunder for such Losses).

                (k) Indemnification for Shareholder Agent. The Company's
shareholders shall, severally and not jointly, on a pro rata basis based on
their proportionate ownership interests in the Company, indemnify, defend and
hold the Shareholder Agent harmless from and against any loss, damage, tax,
liability and expense that may be incurred by the Shareholder Agent arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Shareholder
Agent's duties, except as caused by the Shareholder Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct, including the legal costs and expenses of defending such
Shareholder Agent against any claim or liability in connection with the
performance of the Shareholder Agent's duties. The Shareholder Agent shall be
entitled, but not limited, to such indemnification from the Escrow Fund prior to
any distribution thereof to the Company's shareholders, but after any
distributions therefrom to Parent.

                (l) Depositary Agent's Duties.

                        (i) Limitation on Duties of Depositary Agent. The
Depositary Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as
are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written
escrow instructions which the Depositary Agent may receive after the date of
this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the Shareholder
Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting
on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties. The Depositary Agent shall not be
liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Depositary Agent while acting in
good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
good faith.

                        (ii) Compliance with Orders. The Depositary Agent is
hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey Orders of any court of law
or Governmental or Regulatory Authority, notwithstanding any notices, warnings
or other communications from any party or any other person to the contrary. In
case the Depositary Agent obeys or complies with any such Order, the Depositary
Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by
reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such Order being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered
without jurisdiction or proper authority.



                                      -63-
<PAGE>   73

                        (iii) Limitations on Liability of Depositary Agent. The
Depositary Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of (a) the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder; or (b) the expiration of any rights under any
statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited
with the Depositary Agent.

                        (iv) Good Faith of Depositary Agent. In performing any
duties under the Agreement, the Depositary Agent shall not be liable to any
party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Depositary Agent. The Depositary Agent shall not
incur any such liability for (a) any act or failure to act made or omitted in
good faith, or (b) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument,
including any written statement or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that
the Depositary Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the
Depositary Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations
or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the
Depositary Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with the
Depositary Agent's duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in
any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance
with the advice of counsel. The Depositary Agent is not responsible for
determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to
act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.

                        (v) Non-responsibility of Depositary Agent. If any
controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other
party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions,
the Depositary Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to
take any action regarding it. The Depositary Agent may hold all documents and
shares of Parent Common Stock and may wait for settlement of any such
controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the
Depositary Agent's discretion, the Depositary Agent may be required, despite
what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Depositary
Agent will not be liable for any damages. Furthermore, the Depositary Agent may
at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer
and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Depositary Agent is
authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of
Parent Common Stock held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Depositary Agent due to the
interpleader action and which the parties jointly and severally agree to pay.
Upon initiating such action, the Depositary Agent shall be fully released and
discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of

        9.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, constitute the entire Agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof , except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full
force and effect and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the
Closing in accordance with its terms.

        9.3 Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation. At any time or from
time to time after the Closing, the parties shall execute and deliver to the
other party such other documents and instruments, provide such materials and
information and take such other actions as the other party may reasonably
request to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to cause the other party to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to its obligations to
consummate the Merger to be satisfied. As used in this Agreement, it is
understood that the term "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not obligate
any party to pay to any third party any sums that such third party would not
otherwise be entitled to receive (unless the other party hereto agrees to be
such responsible for such payment).

        9.4 Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or
on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any party of
any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be
deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or condition
of this Agreement on any future occasion. All remedies, either under this
Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, will be cumulative and not
alternative.

        9.5 Third Party Beneficiaries. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their
respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the
parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does not
confer any such rights, upon any other Person other than any Person entitled to
indemnity under Section 5.14 or Article 7.

        9.6 No Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any right,
interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned (by operation of law or
otherwise) by any party without the prior written consent of the other party and
any attempt to do so will be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

        9.7 Headings. The headings and table of contents used in this Agreement
have been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit
the provisions hereof.

        9.8 Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of



                                      -70-
<PAGE>   80

any party hereto under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely
affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement
will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by
the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom and
(d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be
added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

        9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic laws of the State of California, without giving
effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California.

        9.10 WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING
HEREFROM, THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENT TO TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY HERETO AGAINST THE OTHER OR
THEIR SUCCESSORS IN RESPECT OF ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

        9.11 Construction. The parties hereto agree that this Agreement is the
product of negotiation between sophisticated parties and individuals, all of
whom were represented by counsel, and each of whom had an opportunity to
participate in and did participate in, the drafting of each provision hereof.
Accordingly, ambiguities in this Agreement, if any, shall not be construed
strictly or in favor of or against any party hereto but rather shall be given a
fair and reasonable construction without regard to the rule of contra
preferentum.

        9.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

        9.13 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Except where this Agreement specifically provides for arbitration, it
is agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.
