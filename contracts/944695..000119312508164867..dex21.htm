14 Section 2.03 _Purchase Price; Determination of Estimated Purchase Price._

(a) The "Purchase Price" shall equal

(i) the Target Adjusted Statutory Capitalization; minus

(ii) the purchase price adjustment of $23,000,000; plus

(iii) an amount equal to the sum of (A) the product of (x) the amount, if any,
by which the Approved Dividend is less than the Target Dividend (the
"Dividend Shortfall") and (y) 0.80, plus (B) in the event of a Section 9.03(g)
Election, the product of (x) the amount by which the Dividend
Shortfall exceeds $50,000,000 and (y) 0.20; minus

(iv) the 338(h)(10) Adjustment Amount;

(v) plus the Positive Asset Value Adjustment Amount or minus the Negative
Asset Value Adjustment Amount.

A "Section 9.03(g) Election" shall be made if, upon receiving a Section
9.03(g) Notice as described in Section 2.03(c)(i), Buyer elects, within five
(5) Business Days after receipt of the Section 9.03(g) Notice, by delivery to
Seller of an irrevocable written notice of Buyers election, to pay Seller the
amount contemplated in Section 2.03(a)(iii)(B). The "Positive Asset Value
Adjustment Amount" shall be equal to the aggregate amount, if any, by which
the Fair Market Value of the Company Investment Assets Backing Surplus exceeds
the statutory book value of such assets and the "Negative Asset Value
Adjustment Amount" shall be equal to the aggregate amount, if any, by which
the statutory book value of such assets exceeds their Fair Market Value, in
each case as set forth on the Preliminary Purchase Price Statement as
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.03(d).

(b) Attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ is the Companys statutory balance sheet
as of March 31, 2008 (the "Sample Balance Sheet"). Attached hereto as _Exhibit
I_ is a purchase price statement as of March 31, 2008 (the "Sample Purchase
Price Statement"), which Sample Purchase Price Statement has been prepared
using the Sample Balance Sheet and (i) adjusts the Sample Balance Sheet to
account for the transactions contemplated by the Restructuring Agreement, the
exclusion of the Accident and Health Business and the New York Accident and
Health Business, including taking into account any adjustment pursuant to
Section 8.02 of the Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement and the NY
Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement, and reflects the additional
categories of adjustment set forth on the Sample Purchase Price Statement,
including the IMR Adjustment (such result, the "Sample Adjusted Statutory
Capitalization"), (ii) illustrates, after giving effect to the adjustments
described in clause (i), the amount, as of March 31, 2008, of the Additional
Dividend, or the amount, as of March 31, 2008, of any Capital Contribution,
the payment of which would be required to result in the Target
Adjusted Statutory Capitalization, and (iii) the other items of the Purchase
Price described in clauses (ii) through (v) of Section 2.03(a). The Sample
Purchase Price Statement shall be calculated as if March 31, 2008 were
the Closing Date and assumes that (x) the Approved Dividend is equal to the
Target Dividend and (y) except for the purposes of calculating the 338(h)(10)
Adjustment Amount, the Fair Market Value of the Company Investment Assets  



 

15  Backing Surplus equals the statutory book value of such assets (as reflected
on the Sample Balance Sheet). The Sample Purchase Price Statement
shall separately set forth the 338(h)(10) Adjustment Amount and the
calculation thereof as of March 31, 2008 (such separate statement (prepared in
accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 8.06_ of the Disclosure
Schedules), being the "Sample 338(h)(10) Statement"). "Additional Dividend"
shall be equal to the amount of any additional dividend from the Company to
Seller, the payment of which would be required to result in the
Target Adjusted Statutory Capitalization, calculated as of the relevant
balance sheet date. "Capital Contribution" shall be equal to the amount of any
capital contribution from Seller to the Company, the payment of which would be
required to result in the Target Adjusted Statutory Capitalization,
calculated as of the relevant balance sheet date.

(c) No later than (i) ten days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a "Preliminary Balance Sheet" and (ii) two days after Buyers
delivery of the Estimated 338(h)(10) Statement pursuant to Section 2.09
hereof, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a "Preliminary Purchase Price
Statement", in each case calculated as of the last day of the month preceding
the month of the Closing Date (other than in connection with a Deferred
Closing, which will be calculated as of November 30, 2008 for all purposes
hereunder) on a basis consistent with the statutory accounting principles,
procedures, policies, reserving methodology and methods used in calculating
the Sample Balance Sheet, the Sample Purchase Price Statement, and the Sample
Adjusted Statutory Capitalization (such result, the "Preliminary Adjusted
Statutory Capitalization") and in the case of the Preliminary Purchase Price
Statement, calculating the amount of any Additional Dividend, Capital
Contribution and Dividend Shortfall as of such date, as well as reflecting the
estimated 338(h)(10) Adjustment Amount set forth on the Estimated 338(h)(10)
Statement; _provided_ that if the Approved Dividend is not known on such
date, Seller shall use a good faith estimate of such amount as of such balance
sheet date for purposes of calculating the Dividend Shortfall. For purposes of
this delivery requirement (except for the purposes of calculating
the 338(h)(10) Adjustment Amount), the Preliminary Purchase Price Statement
shall be calculated as if the Fair Market Value of the Company Investment
Assets Backing Surplus equals the statutory book value of such assets (as
reflected on the Preliminary Balance Sheet). Such resulting amount shall
constitute the "Estimated Purchase Price". At the same time as it delivers the
Preliminary Balance Sheet, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a notice (a "Section
9.03(g) Notice") stating the amount of Sellers good faith estimate of the
Dividend Shortfall, if any, as of the Closing Date and, if such amount exceeds
$50,000,000, that either (i) Seller has irrevocably determined not to waive
the condition set forth in Section 9.03(g), or (ii) that Seller thereby
irrevocably waives the condition set forth in Section 9.03(g). As promptly as
practicable, Buyer shall review the Preliminary Purchase Price Statement and
the calculations of the Estimated Purchase Price and Seller shall review the
Estimated 338(h)(10) Statement and communicate any disagreements or requests
for clarification to the other party hereto. If either party disagrees with
the Estimated Purchase Price, in whole or in part, Seller and Buyer shall
discuss in good faith, with the participation of appropriate personnel, any
such disagreement and review each others calculations and supporting
materials, with a view to promptly resolving any such disagreement and
promptly reaching a mutually acceptable calculation. If, following such
discussions, which discussions shall not continue longer than two days after
the delivery of the Estimated Purchase Price, the parties cannot reach such a
mutually acceptable calculation, then the parties shall consummate the Closing
based on the Estimated Purchase Price as calculated by Seller (as adjusted to
reflect any disagreements of Buyer that Seller has agreed to accept).



 

16 (d) Seller shall update the Preliminary Purchase Price Statement on the
Closing Date (as of the most recent Business Day preceding the Closing Date)
to reflect the actual Positive Asset Value Adjustment Amount or the Negative
Asset Value Adjustment Amount determined in accordance with Section 2.03 and
Section 2.08, and such actual amount shall thereafter be used in determining
the Estimated Purchase Price for all purposes hereunder.

(e) To the extent that the Approved Dividend approved for payment on, prior
to or as of the Closing reflects any amount of an Additional Dividend (the
"Approved Additional Dividend"), the Company shall not be required to pay such
amount on the Closing Date, but rather shall be required to satisfy such
obligation as specified in Section 2.07. In such event, the Preliminary
Purchase Price Statement shall reflect such payment obligation as a liability
of the Company as of the date of the Preliminary Balance Sheet.

(f) Seller agrees to apply the impairment guidelines set forth on _Section
2.03(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedules (the "Impairment Policy") to the Company
Investment Assets as of the Business Day preceding the Closing Date (other
than (i) the Company Assets Backing Surplus and (ii) the Company Investment

Section 2.05 _Determination of the Final Purchase Price_. __

(a) As promptly as practicable, (i) but no later than 30 days after the
Closing Date, Seller will deliver to Buyer a "Closing Date Balance Sheet" and
(ii) but no later than 5 days after Buyers delivery of the 338(h)(10)
Statement pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
"Closing Date Purchase Price Statement", in each case calculated as of the
Closing Date (other than in connection with a Deferred Closing, which will be
calculated as of December 31, 2008 for all purposes hereunder) on a basis
consistent with the statutory accounting principles, procedures, policies,
reserving methodology and methods used in calculating the Sample Balance
Sheet, the Sample Purchase Price Statement and the Sample Adjusted Statutory
Capitalization (such result, the "Closing Date Statutory Capitalization"),
and, in the case of the Closing Date Purchase Price Statement, calculating the
amount of any Additional Dividend, any Capital Contribution, the Dividend
Shortfall, and the 338(h)(10) Adjustment Amount provided by Buyer under
Section 2.09(b), each as of such date, as well as the Positive or Negative
Asset Value Adjustment Amount.

(b) Buyer and Seller agree that they will cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Purchase
Price Statement and in the conduct of the audits, reviews and resolutions of
disagreements referred to in Section 2.06, including making available all
related Books and Records and appropriate personnel.

Section 2.06 _Disputes Regarding Closing Date Balance Sheet and Closing Date
Purchase Price Statement_.

(a) If Buyer disputes any item reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet or
Closing Date Purchase Price Statement delivered by Seller pursuant to Section
2.05(a) or if Seller disputes the 338(h)(10) Adjustment Amount (each such
item, a "Disputed Item"), then Buyer and Seller shall proceed as set forth in
subsections (b) through (e) below; _provided_ that such parties may only
dispute items reflected on any such statement on the basis (i) that such
amounts were not determined in accordance with the statutory accounting
principles, procedures, policies, reserving methodology and methods employed
by Seller in preparing the Sample Balance Sheet or Sample Purchase Price
Statement, as applicable, or the assumptions or methodologies employed
by Buyer in preparing the 338(h)(10) Statement were not in accordance with
the principles set forth in the Sample 338(h)(10) Statement or (ii) of
arithmetic error or on the basis that the information utilized in the
preparation and calculation of any such statement was not true  



 

18  and correct or not prepared in good faith from the Books and Records of
Seller, Buyer or the Company, as the case may be.

(b) Buyer shall, within 30 days after receiving the Closing Date Balance Sheet
or the Closing Date Purchase Price Statement, as applicable, deliver a notice
of disagreement to Seller. Seller shall, within such time period, deliver a
notice of disagreement with respect to the 338(h)(10) Statement to Buyer. Any
such notice of disagreement must specify in reasonable detail all Disputed
Items as to which Buyer or Seller, as applicable, disagrees, the reasons
therefor and the adjustments to such Disputed Items that Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, believes should be made. Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with
all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Date Balance Sheet or
Closing Date Purchase Price Statement, as applicable, and Seller shall be
deemed to have agreed with all other aspects of the 338(h)(10) Statement.
Buyer and Seller shall, during the 15 days following the delivery of such
notice(s), use their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the
Disputed Items in order to determine and agree upon the Disputed Items.

(c) If, during such 15-day period, Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such
agreement, they shall promptly thereafter submit any remaining Disputed Items
to Ernst and Young LLP or, if Ernst and Young LLP is unavailable, to one of the
other nationally recognized independent accounting firms of standing
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller (who shall not have any material
relationship with Buyer or Seller) (in either case, an "Arbiter") for
resolution in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Such
Arbiter shall consider only those Disputed Items as to which the parties still
disagree. Such Arbiter shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as
practicable, a report setting forth in detail its calculations, methodologies
and decision and the reasons therefor, whereupon the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, Closing Date Purchase Price Statement or 338(h)(10) Statement, as
applicable, shall be adjusted correspondingly. The Arbiters decision is
final and binding upon Buyer and Seller.

(d) "Final Closing Date Balance Sheet" means the Closing Date Balance Sheet
as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.06. "Final Closing
Date Purchase Price Statement" means the Closing Date Purchase Price Statement
as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.06. The Purchase
Price set forth on the Final Closing Date Purchase Price Statement shall
constitute the "Final Purchase Price".

(e) The cost of such Arbiters review and report shall be borne by (i) Seller
if the aggregate difference between the Arbiters aggregate calculation of
the Disputed Items and Sellers aggregate calculation of the Disputed Items is
greater than the aggregate difference between the Arbiters calculation of the
Disputed Items and Buyers aggregate calculation of such Disputed Item, (ii)
by Buyer if the first such difference is less than the second such difference
and (iii) otherwise equally by Buyer and Seller.

Section 2.07 _Adjustments to the Purchase Price_

(a) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price, Seller
shall pay to Buyer, in the manner provided in Section 2.07(c), the amount of
such excess. If the Final  



 

19  Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to
Seller, in the manner provided in Section 2.07(c), the amount of such
excess. 

(b) In the event that the Approved Dividend (including any amount of Approved
Additional Dividend) is greater than the net amount paid to Seller in
accordance with Section 2.04(a) and Section 2.04(b), Buyer shall cause the
Company to pay to Seller, in the manner provided in Section 2.07(c), the
amount of such excess. In the event that the net amount paid to Seller
in accordance with Section 2.04(a) and Section 2.04(b) exceeds the Approved
Dividend, Seller shall pay to the Company, in the manner provided in Section
2.07(c), the amount of such excess, and, in such event, the payment
obligation referred to under Section 2.03(e) shall be cancelled.

(c) Any payment pursuant to Sections 2.07(a) or (b) shall be made at
a mutually convenient time and place within 10 days after the Final Closing
Date Purchase Price Statement has been determined by delivery by Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the other party. 

Section 2.08 _Valuation of Certain Company Investment Assets; Additional
Purchase Adjustment_

(a) By 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day prior to Closing, the parties by
mutual agreement shall designate certain Company Investment Assets
Backing Surplus as "IDC Assets", _provided_ that IDC quotes prices for such
assets. All Company Investment Assets Backing Surplus not designated as IDC
Assets shall be designated "Brokers Assets." The fair market value of each
Company Investment Assets Backing Surplus that is an IDC Asset and each
Company Investment Assets Backing Surplus that is a Brokers Asset shall be
determined as follows:

(i) No later than 9:00 a.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer shall submit to IDC the CUSIP number (or other unique
identifier if CUSIP is not available) and face amount of each IDC Asset and
request that IDC provides as promptly as possible to Buyer and Seller each
such assets price (for the given face amount) as of approximately 3:00 p.m.
on such Business Day. The price quoted by IDC shall be referred to as the
"IDC Price".

(ii) No later than 5:00 p.m. on the fourth Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall submit simultaneously to each of the three Brokers the CUSIP
number (or other unique identifier if CUSIP is not available) and face amount
of each Brokers Asset and request that each Broker provide as promptly as
possible to Buyer and Seller each such assets price (for the given face
amount), with such price setting forth the bid value and ask value of each
such asset as of approximately 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately
prior to the Closing Date. The price quoted by each Broker for each Brokers
Asset shall be the average of such bid and ask price and shall be designated
as the "Brokers Quote" for each such Brokers Asset. 

(iii) Seller and Buyer together shall review the IDC Prices and Brokers
Quotes for any errors and omissions or other disagreements (together,
"Disagreements").  



 

20  If Seller or Buyer discovers any Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall
immediately notify IDC or the applicable Broker, as the case may be, and use
their reasonable best efforts to determine and resolve with the applicable
party any such Disagreement prior to the Closing, or as promptly as possible
after the Closing, in accordance with the principles set forth in this Section
2.08.

 

(b) The fair market value of each IDC Asset shall be the IDC price. The fair
market value of each Brokers Asset is the Brokers Quote remaining for such
asset after discarding the highest and lowest Brokers Quote for such asset.
Such fair market values for the IDC and Brokers Assets shall be referred to as
the "Fair Market Value" of such asset.

(c) For purposes of this Section 2.08:

(i) "Brokers" means the following brokers: Lehman Brothers Inc., Citigroup and
Merrill Lynch; _provided_ , that, if any such broker does not provide a
Brokers Quote, the parties shall cooperate in good faith whether to proceed
without such Brokers Quote and, if necessary, to identify a mutually
acceptable replacement broker.

(ii) "Company Investment Assets Backing Surplus" means those Company
Investment Assets described on Section 3.14(b) of the Disclosure Schedules as
allocated, for the purposes of this Agreement, to the statutory surplus of
the Company as of March 31, 2008, as adjusted for any sales of such Company
Investment Assets and any purchases of replacement securities with the
proceeds of such sales, occurring between and including April 1, 2008 and the
Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, _provided_ that such
sales and purchases satisfy the standards of the investment guidelines
described in Section 5.09 of the Disclosure Schedules; _provided further_ that
for purposes of this  _Section 2.08_ only, any Additional Replacement
Securities (as defined in the Restructuring Agreement) transferred to the
Company by Seller pursuant to Section 2.02(c) of the Restructuring Agreement
shall be deemed Company Investment Assets Backing Surplus (and may be
adjusted as provided hereunder). In the event the Company purchases any such
replacement securities between the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing
Date and the Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall
cooperate to make reasonable adjustment to the deadlines described in this
Section 2.08 in order to obtain the Fair Market Value of such asset prior to
the calculation of Positive Asset Value Adjustment Amount or the
Negative Asset Value Adjustment Amount under Section 2.03(d).

(iii) "IDC" means the pricing and quotation service offered by Financial Time
Interactive Data Corp.

Section 2.09 _Adjustments relating to Section 338(h)(10)
Election; Additional Payment of Purchase Price._

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than five days after Sellers
delivery of the Preliminary Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 2.03(c) hereof
and the resolution of any Disputed Items, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
statement calculated as of the last day of the month preceding the month of
the Closing Date (other than in connection with a Deferred  



 

21  Closing, which will be calculated as of November 30, 2008 for all purposes
hereunder) on a basis consistent with the assumptions and methodologies
used in calculating the Sample 338(h)(10) Statement, and calculating the
338(h)(10) Adjustment Amount as of such date (such statement, the "Estimated
338(h)(10) Statement").

(b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than five days after Sellers
delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 2.05(a) hereof
and the resolution of any Disputed Items with respect thereto, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller a statement calculated as of the Closing Date on a basis
consistent with the assumptions and methodologies used in calculating the
Sample 338(h)(10) Statement, and calculating the 338(h)(10) Adjustment Amount
as of such date (such statement, the "338(h)(10) Statement") ( _provided_ that
there shall be no subsequent adjustments to the 338(h)(10) Adjustment
Amount).

(c) In the event that Seller elects not to make the Section 338(h)(10)
Election (as provided under Section 8.06(a)), and provides written notice of
its determination not to make such election to Buyer, and Buyer shall, within
10 days after receipt of such notice, pay to Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the 338(h)(10) Adjustment Amount plus interest
per annum at LIBOR from and including the Closing Date to the date of such
payment.

Section 2.10  _Preparation of Purchase Price Statements_. For the avoidance
of doubt, each of the Sample Purchase Price Statement, the Preliminary
Purchase Price Statement, the Closing Date Purchase Price Statement and the
Final Closing Date Purchase Price Statement shall be prepared on the basis
that each Transferred Asset (as defined in the Restructuring Agreement) that
has not, as of the date of such statement, been transferred as contemplated by
the Restructuring Agreement (whether due to the failure to obtain a required
consent for such transfer or otherwise), is not, as of such date, owned or
held by the Company.

other than such Liabilities as have been ceded pursuant to a Reinsurance

Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;
_provided_ , however that nothing herein shall prohibit or otherwise limit
Sellers consideration of any Acquisition Transaction involving Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Company) or any other transaction relating to
Seller, the principal purpose of which is not the acquisition of the Company
or the On-Risk Business.

Section 5.05 _Continuing Obligations Relating to Certain Contracts_. Seller
shall or shall cause its Affiliates to not amend or waive any right of
indemnification the Company has under any contracts, agreements or
arrangements to which Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the Company
is party to the extent related to the On-Risk Business or the Off-Risk
Business.

Section 5.06 _Resignations_. Seller will cause, and shall deliver to Buyer at
or prior to the Closing Date the resignations of all officers and directors
of the Company, which shall be effective no later than the Closing Date.

Section 5.07 _Confidentiality by Seller_. On and after the Closing Date,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause it former Representatives to, maintain in confidence and
not use to the detriment of Buyer or its Affiliates, it being understood that
Seller may use such information to defend against a claim by Buyer or in a
claim against Buyer, any confidential written, oral or other information of
the Company, or any confidential information concerning Buyer or its
Affiliates obtained from Buyer or its Representatives in connection with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Contemplated Transactions, except
to the extent (i) such information was previously known on a non-confidential
basis by Seller or any of its Representatives, other than related to the
prior ownership of the Company or the On-Risk Business, or any such
information becomes publicly available, other than because of a disclosure by
Seller or any of its Representatives in violation of this Agreement, (ii) any
such information is required to be disclosed by applicable Law or by Order of
any Governmental Entity, (iii) such information is later acquired by Seller or
any of its Representatives from sources other than those related to their
prior ownership of the Company, (iv) use of such information is necessary or
appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any consent required for the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, (v) to the extent necessary
for Seller or its Representatives to perform their respective obligations
under any Ancillary Agreement or (vi) in connection with the defense of claims
by a third party or pursuant to Article 10 or otherwise. Seller shall
instruct its Representatives, the Representatives of its Affiliates and its
former Representatives having access to such information of such obligation of
confidentiality. Seller shall be responsible for any failure by its
Representatives or former Representatives to comply with this Section 5.07.



 

47 Section 5.08 _Novations of Target A andH Contracts. _From and after the date
hereof, Seller will, and will cause Hanover to, use reasonable best efforts
to obtain required regulatory approvals, if any, from each applicable
Governmental Entity to assume by novation all of the Companys liabilities and
obligations under the Target AandH Contracts in order to ensure that such
liabilities and obligations are solely and exclusively vested in Hanover.
Promptly following receipt of any such requisite regulatory approvals, or from
and after the date hereof to the extent that no regulatory approvals are
required, Seller will, and will cause Hanover to, use reasonable best efforts
to obtain the consent of any counterparty to (i) the Target AandH Contracts
whose consent is required for novations of such Target AandH Contracts and (ii)
any assignments, endorsements, novations or other written instruments or
documents under related reinsurance agreements and administrative services
agreements which provide for reinsurance and administration in respect
of such Target AandH Contracts. No such novation shall be complete unless
Seller or Hanover shall have obtained consents under both clauses (i) and (ii)
herein and no such novation shall be effective prior to the "Effective
Date" (as defined in the Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement). For the
avoidance of doubt, "reasonable best efforts" shall impose on Seller, Hanover
or their Affiliates the obligation to pay typical out-of-pocket expenses but
shall not impose on Seller, Hanover or their Affiliates any obligation to
make payments, incur liabilities or grant contractual or other concessions to
counterparties in order to procure such novation. Target AandH Contracts assumed
by novation by Hanover shall be deemed "Novated Contracts" (as defined in the
Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement) and shall cease to be deemed
"Accident and Health Insurance Contracts" within the meaning of, and shall
thenceforth not be subject to the reinsurance contemplated by, the Accident
and Health Coinsurance Agreement.

Section 5.09 _Company Investment Assets_. Between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, Seller and the Company may not make any material changes
(through maturity, divestiture, liquidation, reinvestment or otherwise) to the
Company Investment Assets (other than any Company Investment Assets that are
Excluded Assets or other assets to be transferred pursuant to the
Restructuring Agreement, the Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement or the
New York Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement), as set forth in _Section
3.14_ of the Disclosure Schedules, without Buyers prior approval; _provided_
that Seller shall be permitted to make changes to such Company Investment
Assets in accordance with the investment criteria set forth in _Section 5.09_
of the Disclosure Schedules.

Section 5.10 _Transition Services_. From the date hereof until the Closing
Date, Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates to, provide Buyer with the
information and services listed on _Section 5.10_ of the Disclosure Schedules
in order to assist and prepare Buyer to assume management of the Company
following the Closing.

extent necessary to permit Seller to determine any matter relating to its
rights and obligations hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement or for any
other reasonable purpose (including for audit, accounting, regulatory,
investigation, dispute or litigation purposes (including any dispute or
litigation arising out of the Off-Risk Business, the AFLIAC Agreements, the
Accident and Health Business or the New York Accident and Health
Business) and for fulfilling disclosure and reporting obligations);
_provided_ that any such access by Seller shall not unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of Buyer. Seller shall bear all of the out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees, but excluding
reimbursement for general overhead, salaries and employee benefits) reasonably
incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the foregoing. For
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing obligation shall include Buyer using its
reasonable best efforts to make reasonably available, upon Sellers written
request, Buyers and its Affiliates Representatives as witnesses, but Buyer
shall have no obligation to make payments or incur any liability in causing
its Representatives (other than its Affiliates and employees) and third party
administrators to take any of the actions specified above.

Section 6.03 _Non-Solicitation_. Except as provided in Section 5.02(a) hereof,
for a period of two years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not,
and shall not induce or encourage any other Person, directly or indirectly,
to, solicit for employment or employ any Person who is an employee of Seller
(full or part-time, including any former employee of Seller  



 

49  who provides consulting services to Seller); _provided_ that nothing herein
shall restrict or preclude Buyer from (i) making generalized
employment solicitations by use of advertisements in the media (including
trade media) or otherwise, so long as such advertisements are not targeted in
any way at such Persons or (ii) soliciting and hiring any employee following
the time such employee has been given notice of termination by Seller or its
Affiliates.

ARTICLE 7.

COVENANTS OF BUYER AND SELLER

Buyer and Seller agree that:

Section 7.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable
under applicable Laws and Orders to promptly satisfy the conditions to the
Closing and to promptly consummate the Contemplated Transactions, including
the obtaining of the approvals of the Insurance Regulators of the
jurisdictions where such approval is required (including without limitation
Massachusetts) and to seek an Approved Dividend that is equal in amount to and
includes the assets comprised in the Target Dividend and Seller and Buyer
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take
such other actions (such as obtaining consents from third parties) as may be
necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the
Contemplated Transactions, including the transactions contemplated by the
Restructuring Agreement. This obligation shall include, in the case of Buyer,
(i) agreeing to continue to perform on an annual basis those closed
block procedures currently being performed by the Company and required by the
DOI and (ii) if requested by any other Insurance Regulator, and subject to the
limitations set forth in the following sentence, as a condition to approval by
such Insurance Regulator of the Contemplated Transactions, funding, or
causing one of its Affiliates to fund, certain assets in trust to support the
Companys liabilities to policyholders resident in the jurisdiction of such
Insurance Regulator. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, neither Buyer nor Seller nor any of their Affiliates shall be required
to take or commit or agree to take, or to refrain from taking or commit or
agree to refrain from taking, any action in connection with satisfying the
conditions to the Closing that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to materially impair the net benefits such party
reasonably expects to obtain in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, including the transactions contemplated in the
Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement, or, in the case of the New York
Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement, result in any non-immaterial
adverse effect (with respect to the net Liabilities being transferred) on
such party and its Affiliates.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer and
Seller shall (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act (if applicable), of a Form A with the DOI (in the case
of Buyer, with the prior review of Seller, including good faith consideration
of any comments from Seller) and of such other filings and documents as are
required by the DOI and other state Insurance Regulators in connection with
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the  



 

50  consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Accident and Health
Coinsurance Agreement, the New York Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement,
the Accident and Health Administrative Services Agreement and the New York
Accident and Health Administrative Services Agreement) as promptly as
practicable and in any event within ten Business Days after the date hereof,
(ii) supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or by any
Insurance Regulator, and (iii) subject to Section 7.01(a), take all other
actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable; it being understood
that, subject to Section 8.05 hereof, Buyer and Seller shall each pay 50% of
(A) the filing and other fees (other than attorneys fees) relating to the
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, and (B) the filing and
other fees (other than attorneys fees) relating to the submission and review
of the Form A and any other filings and documents to the DOI, any Insurance
Regulator or any other Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Buyer shall not be required to make any payments or
incur any liability or make any capital contribution in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Restructuring Agreement.

Section 7.02 _Certain Filings_.

(a) Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with one another (i) in
determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material Contracts or
contractual obligations that are Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities, in
connection with the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and (ii) in
taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

(b) Each party shall have the right to review in advance, subject to
applicable Law and Orders, any filing made by the other party with, or other
written materials submitted by such other party to, any such third party or
any such Governmental Entity in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.
Each party shall consult with the other party about the status of any
consents required to be obtained by such party from any third party or any
such Governmental Entity in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly provide to Seller
copies of all filings, submissions and correspondence made to or received
from any such Governmental Entity in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions (and the substance thereof, to the extent relating to the
Contemplated Transactions). Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
promptly provide to Buyer copies of all filings, submissions and
correspondence made to or received from any such Governmental Entity in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions. In exercising the
foregoing rights, each of Buyer and Seller shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Buyer and Seller agree that they will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the Contemplated
Transactions.

Section 7.03 _Public Announcements_. No party hereto shall issue any press
release or make any public announcement relating to the existence, terms and
conditions or subject matter of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
the Contemplated Transactions prior to the Closing without the prior written
approval of the other party, _provided, however_ , that any party  



 

51  may issue any press release or make any public announcement in such form as
it deems necessary in its sole discretion to comply with the United
States securities Laws, but shall provide a copy to the other party in
advance of its release.

Section 7.04 _Intercompany Arrangements_.

(a) To the fullest extent practicable, Seller shall cause all outstanding
intercompany accounts between Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, to be settled (irrespective of the terms of
payment of such intercompany accounts) immediately prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall cause to be cancelled immediately
prior to the Closing any outstanding intercompany accounts with respect to
Taxes with the exception of $34,609,753 of the income Tax recoverable item
disclosed on the Sample Purchase Price Statement, which shall be settled
immediately prior Closing. Any Intercompany Balances remaining outstanding
after the Closing, as applicable, shall be paid within 30 (thirty) days of the
Closing. "Intercompany Balances" means aggregate payables of the Company, to
Seller and its Affiliates outstanding immediately after the Closing minus
aggregate receivables of the Company, from Seller and its Affiliates
outstanding immediately after the Closing.

(b) Seller shall cause all intercompany agreements (other than those set forth
in _Section 7.04(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules) between Seller or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, to be
terminated, or to provide for an unconditional, full and permanent release of
the Company, immediately prior to the Closing. After such termination or
release, neither the Company nor any Affiliate of the Company shall have any
further rights or obligations under such terminated agreements, except to the
extent of any accruals reflected on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet.

Section 7.05 _Reserves, Accruals and Recoveries_. Upon the occurrence of any
event which, in accordance with SAP, would allow release of any reserves or
accruals for contingent Liabilities, which such reserves or accruals were
included as a Liability in accordance with SAP on the Final Closing Date
Purchase Price Statement (including reserves established with respect to the
Actions set forth in _Section 7.05_ of the Disclosure Schedules), and with
respect to which Seller has indemnification obligations to Buyer pursuant to
Article 10, whether related to the On-Risk Business, the Off-Risk Business,
the Accident and Health Business or the New York Accident and Health Business
(the "Contingent Reserves"), Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller the difference
between the (i) amount of the applicable Contingent Reserve plus interest per
annum at LIBOR from and including the Closing Date to the date of such
permitted release and (ii) the amount of damages actually incurred by Buyer or
the Company (and not otherwise reimbursed to Buyer, the Company or any of
their Affiliates by Seller or any third party) resulting from the liability
with respect to which such Contingent Reserve has been established. Upon
receipt of any awards under litigation, recoveries and reimbursement of other
matters (including those that would relieve the Company of projected
expenses, but excluding any recoveries under any insurance policy maintained
by or on behalf of Buyer), including those matters set forth in _Section
7.05_ of the Disclosure Schedules, in each case that were not set forth
on the Final Closing Date Purchase Price Statement and for which matters
Buyer Indemnified Persons have a right to indemnification from Seller pursuant
to Section 10.02, Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller, in cash, the positive
difference, if any, of the amount actually received by Buyer minus the
aggregate Losses actually imposed on, incurred or suffered by the Company  



 

52  after the Closing Date arising in connection with such litigation or
recovery action. Buyer shall provide a written report to Seller of any
material developments with respect to any Contingent Reserve and this Section
7.05 no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. In
furtherance of the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, in the event the
Company is required under SAP to increase or establish any Contingent
Reserve, then Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of the amount of such reserve
or increase thereof, as applicable, and Seller then shall promptly pay Buyer
such amounts in cash.

Section 7.06 _Retention of Records_. From and after the Closing Date, except
as otherwise required by Law or Order or agreed to in writing, or provided
for in an Ancillary Agreement, each party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, retain all information relating to the other partys business
and operations in accordance with the then general practice of such party with
respect to information relating to its own business and operations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise prohibited by Law or Order,
any party may destroy or otherwise dispose of any such information relating to
the other partys business and operations at any time, _provided_ that, prior
to such destruction or disposal, (i) such party shall provide not less than 90
calendar days prior written notice to the other party, specifying the
information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of and the scheduled date
for such destruction or disposal, and (ii) if the recipient of such notice
shall request in writing prior to the scheduled date for such destruction or
disposal that any of the information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of
be delivered to such requesting party, the party proposing the destruction or
disposal shall promptly arrange for the delivery of such of the information as
was requested at the expense of the requesting party.

Section 7.07 _Post-Closing Arrangements_.

(a) It is the intent of the parties hereto that, to the extent practicable,
Seller and its Affiliates retain, from and after the Closing Date, the
economic and legal rights and obligations, as applicable, to the Excluded
Assets and Liabilities.

(b) If, following the Closing, the Company owns any asset that Seller and
Buyer agree following the Closing should have been an Excluded Asset taking
into account the purpose of the Contemplated Transactions, then, following the
Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to transfer such asset to Seller (or to
one of Sellers Affiliates designated by Seller) or to grant such mutually
agreeable rights with respect to such asset to permit such continued use and
the parties shall make appropriate amendments, to the extent necessary, to IRS
Form 8883; _provided_ , however, that any such transfer or grant shall be at
the cost of Seller or its Affiliate, as applicable.

(c) If, following the Closing, Seller or any of its Affiliates owns any asset
that Seller and Buyer agree following the Closing should not have been an
Excluded Asset taking into account the purpose of the Contemplated
Transactions, then Seller or its Affiliate shall, following the Closing,
transfer such asset to the Company or grant such mutually agreeable rights
with respect to such asset to permit such continued use and the parties shall
make appropriate amendments, to the extent necessary, to IRS Form 8883;
_provided_ , however, that any such transfer or grant shall be at the cost of
Seller or its Affiliate, as applicable.



 

53 Section 7.08 _Service Marks, Trademarks and Trade Names_. On the Closing Date,
Seller shall execute the IP License Agreement with the Company to, among
other things, permit the Company to continue to use on a royalty-free basis
all of the trademarks, trade names, service marks, logo designs or other
identifying marks or symbols utilizing the stylized eagle or the name
"Allmerica" or any derivative thereof (collectively, the "Allmerica
Trademarks") currently in use in the conduct of the Business (other than with
respect to the Excluded Assets and Liabilities), including the use of any
contract materials or policy forms which contain any Allmerica Trademarks, for
a period of up to 18 months following the Closing Date or as otherwise set
forth in the IP License Agreement. Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause the Company to take such action as is necessary, including seeking all
requisite regulatory and shareholder approvals, to change, prior to expiration
of the IP License Agreement, by deleting the Allmerica Trademarks (including
the stylized eagle and the name "Allmerica") therefrom, the product names,
marketing materials, policy forms and other materials that utilize such name,
and to cause the Allmerica Trademarks (including the stylized eagle and
the name "Allmerica") to be deleted from its name. From and after the
expiration of the applicable period specified in the IP License Agreement,
Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company to use any Allmerica
Trademark; _provided_  that this Agreement and the IP License Agreement shall
not preclude uses of or references to the Allmerica Trademarks required by Law
or permissible pursuant to trademark fair use principles or that refer to the
corporate history of the Company, nor require the Company to change or alter
any documents or materials distributed by the Company before such expiration.

Section 7.09  _NY Closing_. The parties agree that when all of the conditions
to Closing as set forth in Article 9 are satisfied or waived, except that the
parties have not obtained the necessary approval of the transactions
contemplated by the New York Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement and
the New York Accident and Health Administrative Services Agreement from the
Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York (the "NY DOI"), the
parties will proceed with the Closing on the last day of the month in which
all of such conditions, except for NY DOI approval, are satisfied or waived in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, subject to the following
adjustments:

(a) Subject to Section 7.01(a), the parties shall use all reasonable best
efforts to obtain the approval of the NY DOI for the
transactions contemplated by the New York Accident and Health Coinsurance
Agreement and the New York Accident and Health Administrative Services
Agreement (the "NY DOI Approvals") on or prior to the Closing Date. If despite
such efforts the parties are unable to obtain the NY DOI Approvals by such
date, on such later date (the "NY Closing Date") that is the last day of the
month in which the parties have obtained the NY DOI Approvals, the Company and
Hanover shall execute and deliver the New York Accident and Health
Coinsurance Agreement and the New York Accident and Health Administrative
Services Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

(b) Prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the New York
Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement and New York Accident and
Health Administrative Services Agreement on the NY Closing Date, if
applicable, or in the event that despite the reasonable best efforts (subject
to Section 7.01(a)) of the parties hereto, the NY DOI Approvals cannot be
obtained, Seller shall, at its own expense and to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law, take actions to administer or cause to be
administered the New  



 

54  York Accident and Health Insurance Contracts on terms and conditions that
are mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer; _provided_ that Seller shall
not be liable for any Losses to Buyer or the Company arising out of or
resulting from the Companys failure to provide Seller with information
reasonably requested by Seller, forward to Seller any written (including
electronic) communications received by the Company or follow Sellers
reasonable instructions, in each case with respect to the operation of the New
York Accident and Health Business. Buyer and Seller shall, and Buyer shall
cause the Company to, cooperate and act reasonably and in good faith in
negotiating and documenting such terms and conditions, which terms and
conditions shall, as closely as is permitted by applicable Law, approximate
the terms and conditions of the New York Accident and Health Coinsurance
Agreement and the New York Accident and Health Administrative Services
Agreement.

(c) From the Closing Date until the NY Closing Date (if any), (i) Seller
shall reimburse Buyer for the amount (if any) by which (x) all expenses
(including for the avoidance of doubt, any increases of reserves required by
SAP to be established by the Company) resulting from, arising out of or
relating to the New York Accident and Health Business exceeds (y) the economic
benefits (including all revenues, profits, interest (including on reserves),
income and appreciation, dividends and distributions, decreases of reserves,
proceeds of any dispositions, sale, co-insurance, reinsurance or liquidation)
resulting from, arising out of or relating to the New York Accident and Health
Business, and (ii) Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the amount (if any)
by which the economic benefits described in (y) above exceed the expenses
described in (x) above. Such reimbursement payment(s) shall be made in cash
(A) on the earlier of the NY Closing Date or the six-month anniversary of the
Closing Date and (B) if the NY Closing Date has not occurred by the six-month
anniversary of the Closing Date, (I) within thirty (30) Business Days after
the end of each full fiscal quarter of the Company thereafter, with (II) a
final settlement to be made on the NY Closing Date (if any). The parties
shall cooperate in good faith to develop reasonable mechanics for the
calculation (including netting and offsetting and to avoid any duplication of
reimbursements) and payment of the net cash amount of such expenses and
economic benefits, including the payment of any post-closing adjustments that
may be necessary with respect to expenses and economic benefits arising
immediately prior to the NY Closing Date.

This Section 7.09 shall not alter or limit, or be deemed to alter or limit,
the parties rights and obligations under Section 10.02(b), except
as expressly set forth therein.

ARTICLE 8.

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

Section 8.01 _Liability for Taxes_.

(a) Except to the extent treated as a liability (and therefore resulted in a
reduction) in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price, Seller shall
be liable for and indemnify Buyer for all Taxes (including, without
limitation, any obligation to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on
a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with respect to a group of
corporations that includes or included the Company and Taxes resulting from
the Company ceasing to be a member of the Seller Group), (i) imposed on the
Seller Group (other than the Company) for any taxable year, (ii) imposed on
the Company or for which the Company may otherwise be liable  



 

55  for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and,
with respect to any taxable year or period beginning before and ending after
the Closing Date, the portion of such taxable year ending on and including
the Closing Date. Except to the extent treated as an asset in the calculation
of the Purchase Price, Seller shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes of the
Company for any tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date or for which Seller was otherwise responsible. To the extent permitted by
Law, Buyer shall waive any carrybacks for periods ending after the Closing
Date to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of
any Tax benefit actually received attributable to any carryback to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, _provided_ that Seller shall have no obligation to make
any claims for refunds or amend any Tax Return with respect to such
carrybacks unless Seller is otherwise filing an amended Tax Return or other
claim for refund for the period of the carryback. Seller shall be deemed to
have actually realized a Tax benefit to the extent that, and at such time as,
the amount of Taxes payable by Seller is reduced below the amount of Taxes
that Seller would be required to pay but for the carryback, _provided_ that
Seller shall be treated as utilizing such carrybacks after utilizing all other
available Tax attributes.

(b) Except to the extent arising from a breach of representation or covenant
of Seller or from obligations set forth herein, Buyer shall be liable for and
indemnify Seller for the Taxes of the Company for any taxable year or period
that begins after the Closing Date and, with respect to any taxable year or
period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date, the portion of
such taxable year beginning after the Closing Date. Buyer shall be entitled to
any refund of Taxes of the Company received for such periods.

(c) For purposes of Sections 8.01(a) and (b) and, whenever it is necessary to
determine the liability for Taxes of the Company for a portion of a taxable
year or period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date, the
determination of the Taxes of the Company for the portion of the year or
period ending on, and the portion of the year or period beginning after, the
Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Company had a taxable
year or period which ended at the close of the Closing Date, except that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis,
such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time basis.

(d) If a Section 338(h)(10) Election is not made, Sellers payment obligations
hereunder shall be net of any Tax benefit actually realized by the
Indemnified Party.

(e) (i) Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due all federal Tax
Returns and Combined Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company for taxable years or periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and, except to the extent treated as a liability in the
calculation of the Purchase Price, shall pay any Taxes due in respect of such
federal Tax Returns and Combined Tax Returns, and (ii) Seller shall file or
cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed on or
before the Closing Date by or with respect to the Company for taxable years
ending on or before the Closing Date and shall pay any Taxes due in respect
of such Tax Returns.

(f) Buyer shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns (other
than the Tax Returns referred to in Sections 8.01(d)(i) or (d)(ii)) required
to be filed by or with respect to the Company after the Closing Date with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any such Return  



 

56  shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and without a
change of any election or any accounting method and shall be submitted by
Buyer to Seller for Sellers approval (together with schedules, statements
and, to the extent requested by Seller, supporting documentation) at least ten
(10) business days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax
Return,  _provided_ that Buyer shall not be required to prepare such Returns
in a manner consistent with past practice, and it may change any election or
any accounting method, and it shall not be required to obtain Sellers
approval, to the extent that Buyer waives its right to be indemnified by
Seller from any liability arising by reason of any item, election, or method
that differs from past practice. Buyer agrees to make such changes in such Tax
Returns as Seller shall reasonably request,  _provided_ that Buyer will not
be required to make any such reasonable changes to the extent that it agrees
to release Seller from its obligation to indemnify Buyer for any Taxes arising
by reason of Buyers failure to accept such proposed change. To the extent
Seller is responsible for such Tax under this Article 8, Seller shall pay the
amount due on the Tax Return to Buyer two (2) Business Days prior to the date
that the Tax becomes due.

(g) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by Buyer, any
of its affiliates or the Company of written notice of any pending
or threatened federal, state, local or foreign income or franchise tax audits
or assessments or other proceedings (including Tax contests) ("Tax
Proceedings") with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the Company,
_provided_ that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect
Buyers right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent Sellers
ability to defend against any such tax claim is materially prejudiced thereby.
If Seller could have an indemnification obligation under this Agreement as a
result of such Tax Proceeding, including as a result of any item that appears
on the federal consolidated Tax Return or Combined Tax Return of Seller that
includes a Pre-Closing Tax Period, then, with respect to the particular issue
that could give rise to Sellers indemnification obligation under the terms of
this Agreement, Seller shall have the right to conduct and control the defense
of such Tax Proceeding at its expense, whether such Tax Proceeding commenced
before or commences after the Closing, and Buyer and the Company shall provide
Seller with all necessary powers of attorney and other necessary documents and
assistance to allow Seller to effectively conduct and control such defense,
_provided_ that Buyer shall be entitled to participate at its expense in the
defense of any such claim which may be the subject of indemnification by
Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(a) and _provided_ further that Seller may not
settle or compromise any issue that may materially affect the Tax liability of
Buyer in a Post-Closing Tax Period without Buyers consent, which may not be
unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall control the defense of any claim for
Taxes other than income Taxes of the Seller Group or as described above,
_provided_ that Seller shall be entitled to participate at its expense in the
defense of any claim which may be the subject of indemnification by Seller
pursuant to Section 8.01(a); further, that Buyer may not settle or compromise
any such claim without Sellers consent, which may not be unreasonably
withheld. Buyer may, however, settle or compromise any such claim without
Sellers consent if it agrees to release Seller of its indemnification
obligation with respect to such claim. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions set forth in this Article 8 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the
control of the defense of claims for Taxes under Section 10.04.

Section 8.02 _Information to be Provided by Buyer_. With respect to the
taxable year of Company ending December 31, 2007 and the period in 2008 (or
2009, as appropriate) prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly cause
the Company to prepare and provide to Seller a  



 

57  package of tax information materials (the "Tax Package"), which shall be
completed in accordance with past practice including past practice as to
providing the information, schedules and work papers and as to the method of
computation of separate taxable income or other relevant measure of income of
the Company. Buyer shall cause the Tax Package for the portion of the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date to be delivered to Seller within one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date.

Section 8.03  _No Amendments or Extensions_. Except as required by applicable
Law, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company) shall,
without prior written consent of Seller, refile, amend or otherwise modify (or
grant an extension of any applicable statute of limitations period with
respect to) any Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period filed by
or with respect to the Company.

Section 8.04 _Assistance, Cooperation, and Retention of Documents_. After the
Closing Date, each of Seller and Buyer shall:

(a) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist) the other party
in preparing any Tax Returns or reports which such other party is responsible
for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 8.01(d) or Section
8.01(f) as the case may be;

(b) cooperate fully in preparing for any Tax Proceedings with
Taxing Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company;

(c) make available to the other and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Company;

(d) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
threatened Tax Proceedings of the Company for taxable periods for which the
other may have a liability under Section 8.01;

(e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
Taxing Authority in connection with any Tax Proceeding or information request
with respect to any such taxable period; and

(f) retain or cause to be retained all Books and Records relating to Taxes
pertinent to the Company until the applicable period of assessment under
Law (giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired, and to
abide by or cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered
into with any Taxing Authority.

Section 8.05 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Seller agree to pay equally any
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and similar Taxes,
fees and charges arising in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that Seller
will pay all such Taxes, fees or charges in connection with the transactions
contemplated in the Restructuring Agreement.



 

58 Section 8.06 _Section 338(h)(10) Election and Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Upon the written request of Seller, at its sole and exclusive discretion,
to be made no later than ten (10) Business Days following the determination
of the Final Closing Date Purchase Price Statement, Seller and Buyer shall
join in making an election within five days after the date of Sellers written
request under Code section 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding election
under state, local, or foreign law) (a "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with
respect to Buyers purchase of the stock of the Company pursuant to this
Agreement. Such decision by Seller to make a joint Section 338(h)(10)
Election shall be irrevocable.

(b) In the event that Seller gives written notice of its intention to make a
Section 338(h)(10) Election pursuant to Section 8.06(a) and such Section
338(h)(10) Election is timely and irrevocably made with the appropriate Taxing
Authority, Seller shall include all related items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit on Sellers applicable federal consolidated Tax Returns
and Combined Tax Returns for the final Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(c) In contemplation that a Section 338(h)(10) Election will be made, Seller
and Buyer have agreed on the principles governing the allocation of the
Purchase Price (determined in accordance with Code section 338), plus
liabilities assumed, among the assets deemed to have been acquired as a
result of the Section 338 Election as set forth in _Section 8.06 _of the
Disclosure Schedules (such allocation, the "Purchase Price Allocation").
_Section 8.06_ of the Disclosure Schedules also sets forth the methodologies
for calculating the 338(h)(10) Adjustment Amount as described in Article 2
hereof.

(d) In the event that Seller gives notice pursuant to Section 8.06(a), Buyer
and Seller will jointly and timely file IRS Form 8023 for the Section
338(h)(10) Election (and any applicable corresponding forms of any other
relevant jurisdiction). Seller and Buyer will also exchange completed and
executed copies of IRS Form 8883, any required schedules thereto (and any
applicable corresponding forms of any other relevant jurisdiction), not later
than ten (10) days prior to the applicable filing date. Each of Buyer and
Seller will, to the extent required by applicable Law, file the forms referred
to in this Section 8.06(d) with their appropriate Tax Return.

qualifications relating to materiality, including the term "Material Adverse
Effect") _provided_ that with respect to indemnification by Buyer for Warranty
Breaches pursuant to this Section 10.03 (other than Warranty Breaches pursuant
to Section 4.01, Section 4.01 and Section 4.08) (A) Buyer shall not be liable
for any individual Warranty Breach (and such Warranty Breach shall be

Warranty Breach exceeds $25,000 (it being understood that all Warranty
Breaches arising from the same nucleus of operative facts shall collectively
be deemed an individual Warranty Breach for purposes of this clause (A)), (B)

_provided_ that the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C) shall not apply to any
misrepresentation or breach of Section 4.01, Section 4.01 or Section 4.08 or
any claim involving fraud or intentional or willful breach);

(b) any breach of a covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer or

65 (c) the Off-Risk Business (including, for purposes of clarity, the part of the

to the extent that Seller or its Affiliates has an obligation to indemnify
Buyer pursuant to Section 10.02 or any AFLIAC Agreement as amended through the
date hereof.

Section 10.04 _Procedure for Third Party Claims_.

(a) After the Closing, if there is asserted against either a Buyer Indemnified
Person or a Seller Indemnified Person, as the case may be (referred to
hereinafter as an, "Indemnified Party"), any claim, demand, action,
proceeding or investigation instituted by a Person other than an Indemnified
Party (a "Third Party Claim") which may give rise to an Indemnified Claim
against Seller or Buyer, as the case may be (referred to herein after as an,
"Indemnifying Party"), under this Article 10, then the Indemnified Party will
give written notice with respect thereto to the Indemnifying Party promptly
following such Indemnified Partys receipt of such Third Party Claim;
_provided,_ however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
obligation under this Article 10, except to the extent such delay actually
prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Third Party Claim
with counsel of its choice and at its own expense so long as (i) the
Indemnifying Party gives written notice to the Indemnified Party within
fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party intends to defend the Indemnified
Party and (ii) the Third Party Claim does not solely seek an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. Once the Indemnifying
Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the
defense thereof, including the opportunity to participate in any discussions
or correspondence with any Government Entity, and to employ counsel separate
from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Partys
participation in any such defense shall be at its own expense unless the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to
the proceedings and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
have mutually concluded in good faith that representation of both parties by
the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between them or the availability to the Indemnified Party of one or
more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those
that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect thereof or, and in
such case, all such expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with such participation shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party.

(c) The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such judgment, compromise or
settlement (i) provides for the payment by the Indemnifying Party of money as
sole relief for the claimant, (ii) results in the full and general release of
the Indemnified Party from all liabilities arising or relating to, or in
connection with, the Third Party Claim, (iii) involves no finding or admission
of any violation of any law or the rights of any Person and no effect on any
other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, and (iv) involves no imposition of a consent order, decree or  



 

66  injunction that would restrict the future activity of the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates in any material respect.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver the notice contemplated by
clause (i) of Section 10.04(b) within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified
Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim or the Indemnifying Party is
not entitled to defend the Third Party Claim as contemplated by clause (ii) of
Section 10.04(b), the Indemnified Party may defend such Third Party Claim;
_it being understood_ that the Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification
under this Article 10, including rights to indemnification for any costs or
other Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with defending
or settling such Third Party Claim, for such Third Party Claim shall not be
adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall (i) upon the request of the Indemnifying Party,
inform, in reasonable detail, the Indemnifying Party of the status of the
defense of the Third Party Claim, and (ii) if such views are offered, give the
Indemnifying Partys views in connection with the defense of the Third Party
Claim good faith consideration;  _provided_ , however, that the Indemnified
Party will have no obligation to follow or implement the Indemnifying Partys
views except to the extent specified below. The Indemnified Party may not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld) of the Indemnifying
Party.

(e) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and
shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.
Such cooperation also shall include the retention and, upon the Indemnifying
Partys request, the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees or other representatives available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder; _provided_ that such cooperation shall not unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of such party. All
reasonable Losses incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party in connection
with responding to, complying with or satisfying the Indemnifying Partys
requests for cooperation shall be promptly reimbursed by the Indemnifying
Party.

Section 10.05 _Calculation of Losses_.

(a) The amount of any Losses payable under Article 10 by the Indemnifying
Party shall be (i) net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to
be responsible therefor (including pursuant to the Accident and Health
Coinsurance Agreement or the New York Accident and Health Coinsurance
Agreement), net of any actual costs or expenses incurred in connection with
securing or obtaining such amounts recovered with respect to such Loss and
(ii) if a Section 338(h)(10) Election is not made, net of any Tax benefit
actually realized by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party actually
recovers any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party
shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for the excess (if any)
of (i) the indemnification payment made  



 

67  by the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Loss or expense incurred by
the Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification
payment plus the amount received under applicable insurance policies or from
any other Person by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss, net of
any actual costs or expenses incurred in connection with securing or obtaining
such amounts recovered less (ii) the full amount of such Loss.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 10.02 for any
Losses relating to any matter to the extent that reserves for such Losses
(plus interest per annum at LIBOR from and including the Closing Date) were
expressly set forth on the Final Closing Date Purchase Price Statement.

Section 10.06 _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses pursuant to
Section 10.02 or Section 10.03 and the Indemnified Party could, in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnifying Party, have recovered all or a part of
such Losses from a third party (a "Potential Contributor"), including without
limitation under any Producer Agreement, Reinsurance Agreement or On-Risk
Business Agreement, based on the underlying claim asserted against the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to
proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the
Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of
such payment; _provided_ that, to the extent the Indemnified Party has a
material, ongoing business relationship with the Potential Contributor, the
Indemnifying Party shall consult with the Indemnified Party in good faith
regarding proceeding in a manner that seeks to minimize the adverse effect of
any such proceeding on such business relationship. The parties further agree
that no Buyer Indemnified Party shall have any obligation under this Section
10.06 or under Section 10.07 to assert or pursue any right to recover or
otherwise seek or attempt to recover, or to assign or subrogate to Seller any
right to recover or opportunity to seek or attempt to recover, any amounts
that may be available under Buyers applicable insurance policies; _provided_
, that this shall in no way limit Buyers obligation under Section 10.05 of
the AFLIAC Stock Purchase Agreement, including with respect to certain
insurance policies set forth on Schedule 3.30(a) to such agreement.

Section 10.07 _Mitigation_. After the Closing, upon and after becoming aware
of any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to give rise
to any Losses with respect to which indemnification may be required hereunder,
an Indemnified Party will use reasonable best efforts to mitigate all such
Losses, including to assert and pursue any right to recover under any
Producer Agreement, Reinsurance Agreement or On-Risk Business Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, Losses for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification in accordance with this Article 10 shall include all costs,
fees, expenses and other amounts paid or incurred by an Indemnified Party in
connection with its mitigation efforts in accordance with this Section 10.07.

Section 10.08 _Exclusivity_. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer waives any
rights and claims Buyer may have against Seller, whether in law or in equity,
relating to the Company or the Shares or the Contemplated
Transactions, except for rights and claims expressly contemplated by this
Agreement (including Article 2, Article 8 and Article 10 hereof) or
specifically in any Ancillary Agreement and except for any claims of fraud or
intentional or willful breach. Effective as of the Closing, the rights and
claims expressly contemplated by  



 

68  Article 2, Article 8 and Article 10 hereof or specifically in any Ancillary
Agreement, except for any claims of fraud or intentional or willful breach,
shall provide the exclusive remedy and only source of procedures with respect
to any claim relating to the Company or the Shares or the Contemplated
Transactions. Article 8 shall provide the exclusive remedy and only source of
procedures with respect to any claim that is made under or subject to Article
8.

Section 10.09 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any amount paid by Seller or Buyer
under Section 2.07, Section 7.05, Section 7.09(c), Article 8 and Article 10
will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 10.10 _Beneficiaries, Investigation and Waivers_. Seller Indemnified
Parties and Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be intended third party
beneficiaries of the indemnification obligations of Buyer and Seller,
respectively, in this Article 10. Neither Buyers nor Sellers right to
indemnity pursuant to this Article 10 shall be adversely affected by (i) any
investigation conducted by or on behalf of such party or by any
knowledge acquired by or on behalf of such party as a result of such
investigation or otherwise, in each case whether before or after the date of
this Agreement or the Closing Date or (ii) its waiver of a condition to
Closing set forth in Article 10. 

Section 10.11 _Payments_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable
pursuant to this Article 10, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a bill, together with
all accompanying reasonably detailed back-up documentation, for a Loss that is
the subject of indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party in
good faith disputes the Loss, in which event it shall so notify the
Indemnified Party. In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount
of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder no later than thirty (30) days
following any Final Determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Partys
liability therefor. A "Final Determination" shall exist when (i) the parties
to the dispute have reached an agreement in writing, (ii) a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable order or judgment,
or (iii) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-
appealable determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to
submit thereto.

ARTICLE 11.

TERMINATION

Section 11.01  _Termination Prior to Closing_. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

(b) by either Seller or Buyer, if the Closing shall not have been consummated
(other than through the failure of the applicable party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(b) to fully and promptly comply
with its obligations hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement) on or before
March 31, 2009 (subject to no more than two automatic extensions of 30 days
if any authorization, consent, Order or approval required under Section
9.01(b) as a condition to the consummation of the Closing or, subject to
Section 7.09 hereof, of  



 

69  the transactions contemplated under the Accident and Health Coinsurance
Agreement, the New York Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement, the
Accident and Health Administrative Services Agreement or the New York
Accident and Health Administrative Services Agreement shall be the sole
condition pending on such date (other than any such conditions to be satisfied
at the Closing));

(c) by either Seller or Buyer, if consummation of the transactions
contemplated to be consummated at the Closing (including, subject to Section
7.09 hereof, the transactions contemplated under the Accident and Health
Coinsurance Agreement, the New York Accident and Health Coinsurance Agreement,
the Accident and Health Administrative Services Agreement and the New York
Accident and Health Administrative Services Agreement) would violate any
nonappealable final Order of any Governmental Entity having competent
jurisdiction; and

(d) by either Buyer or Seller, if a breach of any provision of this Agreement
has been committed by the other party so that a mutual condition to Closing or
a condition to Closing for the benefit of the non-breaching party is not
satisfied and such breach is incapable of cure.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.01(b), Section 11.01(c) or Section 11.01(d) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

Section 11.02 _Effect of Termination_. If all or any portion of this
Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 11.01 such termination shall
be without liability of either party (or any Representative of such party) to
the other party to this Agreement;  _provided_ that, if such termination
shall result from the willful (i) failure of either party to fulfill a
condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party, (ii)
failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or (iii) breach by either
party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement contained herein,
such party shall be fully liable for all damages incurred or suffered by the
other party as a result of such failure or breach, it being understood that
such liability does not extend to any non-compensatory, punitive, indirect or
consequential damages. The provisions of this Section 11.02 and Section 6.01,
Section 12.04, Section 12.07, Section 12.08, Section 12.09, Section 12.10,
Section 12.11 and Section 12.12 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant
to Section 11.01.

71 Section 12.02 _Amendments and Waivers; Remedies Cumulative_.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of
an amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by
the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

Section 12.03 _Disclosure Schedules_. Contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Sellers are delivering to Buyer the Disclosure
Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules are deemed to constitute an integral part
of this Agreement and, subject to the last sentence of this Section 12.03, all
representations and warranties of Sellers are made subject to the exceptions
which are noted in the Disclosure Schedules. The inclusion of any item in the
Disclosure Schedules shall not be construed as an indication of the
materiality or lack of materiality of such item. The failure to disclose a
matter or item in one Section of the Disclosure Schedules shall not constitute
a breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement so long as
such matter or item is disclosed elsewhere in the Disclosure Schedules and
the applicability of such disclosure to another representation and warranty
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure notwithstanding the
absence of a cross-reference.

Section 12.04 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided for herein (including
without limitation in Section 7.01(b) and Section 8.05), all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense.

Section 12.05 _No Rights of Setoff_. No payment to be made by Buyer to Seller
or Seller to Buyer, as applicable, hereunder shall be subject to any setoff,
counterclaim, deduction, withholding or recoupment for claims made
pursuant to or amounts due or owing under this Agreement (including Article
10), any Ancillary Agreement or otherwise (except as otherwise provided in any
such agreement).

Section 12.06 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Neither Seller nor Buyer may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other and any attempted
assignment without the required consent shall be void; _provided,_ that
no such consent from Seller shall be required for Buyer to assign part or all
of its rights under this Agreement to one or more of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries, but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder and, furthermore, no such assignment will be made by
Buyer if such assignment could impair, delay or prevent the obtaining of any
authorization, consent, Order or approval of a Governmental Entity necessary
for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions or violate the terms of
any authorization, consent, Order or approval of a Governmental Entity
obtained in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.



 

72 Section 12.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

Section 12.08 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware or any Delaware state court, so long as one
of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action
or proceeding, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Without
limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such
party as provided in Section 12.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

Section 12.09 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT
THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER
SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM
MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE
KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY
TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY SUCH PROCEEDING WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

Section 12.10  _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). No provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations,
or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 12.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and
any other agreements expressly entered into on the date hereof constitute the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and supersede all prior  



 

73  agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

Section 12.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.
