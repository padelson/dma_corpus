the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. In addition, at the
Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

(c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to

elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause up to
seven (7) members of the Company Board designated by the Company who are
members of the Company Board as of the Closing and who are reasonably
acceptable to Parent to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time; provided, that at least one (1) such
designee shall be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

  

  

(d) After the Effective Time, if the Surviving Corporation shall determine or
shall be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2

Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of
conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and
things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and
all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

(the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Chicago, Illinois time, on a
date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"), such date to be no
later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Sidley Austin
LLP, One South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603, unless another time,

effective at the time the Articles of Merger shall have been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Vermont or such other date and time as
is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Articles of Merger, such
date and time hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time".

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

  

Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2, each share of
common stock, $6 par value, of the Company (each, a "Share" and collectively,
the "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other
than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive in cash,
without interest, $35.10 per Share (the "Merger Consideration"). At the
Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Certificate")
formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest, subject to compliance with the procedures for surrender of
such Shares as set forth in Section 2.2.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Ultimate Parent-Owned Stock. All Shares
that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

  

  

(c) Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, no par value, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one (1) newly and validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(d) Merger Consideration Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or the
securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period,
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event; provided that no such adjustment shall result in any
increase to the Aggregate Merger Consideration.

  

  

Section 2.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a
nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of
the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to
the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Fund"). Funds made available
to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by
Parent, in (i) short-term obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than 30 days, (ii) commercial paper obligations rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's,
respectively, or (iii) deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or banker's
acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or
Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has
capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $1.0 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
publicly available at the SEC or otherwise), in each case, pending payment
thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to this Article
II. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Paying Agent shall, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, deliver the cash contemplated to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. To the extent that there are losses with respect to
such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt cash payment of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore
the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to promptly make such cash payments.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Procedures for Surrender. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a Certificate or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-
Entry Shares"), in each case whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify after consultation with the Company; and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares were converted pursuant to Section
2.1(a), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and
Merger Consideration may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or shall
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have been paid
or are not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration into which the Shares
theretofore represented by such Certificate or such Book-Entry Shares have
been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a). No interest shall be paid or accrue
on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  

  

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. As of the close of
business on the date of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon surrender of any
Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. At any
time following nine (9) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
portion of the

Exchange Fund (including any interest or other income received by the Paying
Agent in respect of all funds made available to it) not disbursed to holders
of Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Shares and compliance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.2(b), without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any holder of a Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of the date that is
immediately prior to such time as such Merger Consideration would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
any claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(e) Withholding Rights. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective agents (including the Paying Agent), as the case may be,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options,
Restricted Stock or RSUs, as applicable, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective agents (including the
Paying Agent) is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment
under the Code or any other provision of applicable Law (including any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law); provided that any
transfer or other similar Taxes payable in connection with the Merger (other
than such Taxes required to be paid by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the holder of record of the Shares with
respect to which such payment is made) shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any agent, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares,
Company Options, Restricted Stock or RSUs, as applicable, in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or their applicable agent, as the case may be.

  

  

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the portion of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a); provided, however, that
Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

  

Section 2.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) and held
by a holder who has perfected such holder's right to dissent under Section
13.01 et seq. of the VBCA and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right
as of the Effective Time (such Shares, "Dissenting Shares") shall

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.1(a), and shall instead represent the right to receive
payment of the consideration due to the holder of Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Sections 13.02 and 13.25 of the VBCA. If any such holder fails
to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such holder's right to
dissent under the VBCA or other applicable Law, then such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to
have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), without interest. The Company
will submit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, for the Company Shareholder Approval (as set forth in Section 3.22
hereof) pursuant to Section 13.20(a) of the VBCA at the Company Shareholder
Meeting, the notice of which will include a copy of Chapter 13 of the VBCA and
will state that the shareholders are or may be entitled to assert dissenters'
rights thereunder. In accordance with Section 13.22 of the VBCA, the Company
will deliver a written dissenters' notice to all shareholders who timely
submit an intent to demand payment for their shares, and who otherwise comply
with Section 13.21 of the VBCA. The Company shall serve prompt notice to
Parent of any demands received by the Company for payment of the fair value of
such Shares under the VBCA and of withdrawals of such notice and any other
instruments provided pursuant to applicable Law, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle
or compromise, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

Section 2.4 Treatment of Company Options, Restricted Stock, RSUs and Equity
Plans.

  

  

(a) Treatment of Company Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions reasonably necessary and appropriate to
provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option
to purchase Shares (the "Company Options") under any stock option plan of the
Company, including the Company's 1997 Stock Option Plan for Key Employees,
2000 Stock Option Plan for Key Employees and Omnibus Stock Plan, and any other
plan, agreement or arrangement of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(collectively, the "Company Option Plans"), shall be fully vested and
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled
Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor and full
satisfaction thereof, a payment in cash (subject to any withholding in
accordance with Section 2.2(e)) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Shares previously subject to such Company Option and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share
previously subject to such Company Option (such amounts payable hereunder, the
"Option Payments"). From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled
Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof,
but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option Payment. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash payable with respect to any
Company Option.

  

  

(b) Treatment of Restricted Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each unvested Share subject to forfeiture restrictions, repurchase rights or
other restrictions ("Restricted Stock") granted pursuant to any restricted
stock plan of the Company,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

including the Omnibus Stock Plan or any other plan, agreement or arrangement
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, shall vest in full, and all
restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions or repurchase rights)
otherwise applicable to such Restricted Stock shall lapse, and each share of
Restricted Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest (subject to any withholding in accordance with
Section 2.2(e)).

  

  

(c) Treatment of Restricted Stock Units. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each contractual right to receive a Share at a date (each, an "RSU")
granted pursuant to any performance share incentive plan of the Company,
including the Company's 2009, 2010 and 2011 Performance Share Incentive Plans,
or any other plan, agreement or arrangement of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (collectively, together with the Company Option Plans, the "Company
Equity Plans"), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
to the extent vested prior to or upon the Merger in accordance with its
applicable terms, shall be cancelled and in exchange therefor, each former
holder of any such cancelled RSU shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such RSU and in settlement therefor and
full satisfaction thereof, an amount in cash (subject to any withholding in
accordance with Section 2.2(e)) equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such vested portion of
the RSU as of the Effective Time, with such cash payable under the terms of
the RSU. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash payable with respect
to any RSU.

  

  

(d) Termination of Company Equity Plans. After the Effective Time, all Company
Equity Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options, Restricted
Stock, RSUs or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted
thereunder.

  

  

(e) Parent Funding. At the Effective Time, Parent shall make a cash
contribution to the Surviving Corporation in immediately available funds to
permit the Surviving Corporation to make the payments required under this
Section 2.4.

Section 3.8 Internal Control and Disclosure Controls.

  

  

(a) The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company (a) has designed and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management (including the Company's principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions) as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (b)
based on its most recent evaluation of internal control prior to the date
hereof, has disclosed to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any such disclosure made
by management to Company's auditors and to the audit committee since December
31, 2008. Since December 31, 2008, to the knowledge of the Company, no
attorney representing the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation, relating to periods after December 31,
2008.

subject to any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether accrued,
absolute, determined, determinable, fixed or contingent, that would be
required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet in accordance with
GAAP as of the date hereof. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture,
off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract or arrangement
(including any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or
among the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand), or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under
the Exchange Act), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract or
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the

status of any such Company Benefit Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, (ii)
each VEBA has been determined by the IRS to be exempt from Federal income tax
under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no

prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section

administrative exemption), with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that could
reasonably be

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

expected to result in material liability to the Company, and (iv) no suit,
administrative proceeding, claim, audit, examination, investigation, action or
other litigation has been brought, or to the knowledge of the Company, is

other than an event for which the reporting requirements have been waived by
regulations) has occurred or is expected to occur, (ii) none of the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has failed to satisfy the minimum funding standard

expected to be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). Except as set forth in Section 3.12(g)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, neither

information and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(b) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall as
promptly as practicable notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC as promptly
as practicable after the other party has had a reasonable

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the common shareholders of the Company. The
Proxy Statement will comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and other applicable Law,
including the regulations and requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.

  

  

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company's common
shareholders in accordance with Section 5.2(a), duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting. The Company shall not,
except to the extent required by Law or a Governmental Entity, adjourn,
postpone or cancel (or propose any adjournment, postponement or cancellation
of) the Company Shareholder Meeting without the prior consent of Parent;
provided, that unless not permitted by Law or a Governmental Entity, the
Company shall adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting upon the reasonable
request of Parent. The Company Board shall present this Agreement for approval
at the Company Shareholder Meeting. At the Company Shareholder Meeting, unless
there shall have been a Company Board Change of Recommendation in accordance
with Section 5.4, the Company Board shall recommend that the Company's common
shareholders approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger (the "Company Board Recommendation"), and the Company
shall, unless there has been a Change of Company Board Recommendation, use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of
the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and to take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts (including relevant disclosure in the Proxy
Statement) to allow Parent, directly or through its representatives, to
solicit proxies in favor of the Merger and this Agreement and against any
resolution submitted by any holder of Company Common Stock, including, if so
requested by Parent, using the services of dealers and proxy solicitation
services, to secure the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Company's common shareholders. The Company agrees that its obligations
pursuant to this Section 5.2 (other than those set forth in the fourth
sentence of this Section 5.2(c)) shall not be affected by (i) the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any Change of Company Board
Recommendation. The Company shall provide Parent with the Company's
shareholder list upon request by Parent, including at any time following a
Change of Company Board Recommendation.

  

  

Section 5.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall,
shall cause each Company Subsidiary, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause VELCO and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and other
representatives (collectively, "Company Representatives") to: (i) provide to
Parent and Merger Sub and their respective directors, officers, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents, and other
representatives (collectively, the "Parent Representatives") reasonable access
during normal business hours in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the operation of any business conducted by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or VELCO, upon prior written notice to the Company, to the
officers, employees, auditors, properties, offices and other

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

facilities of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and VELCO and to the books
and records thereof; (ii) furnish promptly information concerning the
business, properties, contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company,
Company Subsidiaries and VELCO as Parent or the Parent Representatives may
reasonably request; and (iii) to the extent permitted by Law, furnish promptly
each report, schedule and other document filed or received by the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities or regulatory Laws or filed with or sent to the SEC, FERC,
the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or any other
Governmental Entity; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required
to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary or VELCO to) afford such access or
furnish such information to the extent that the Company believes in good faith
that doing so would: (A) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege
(provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege); (B) violate any obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary with respect to confidentiality to any third party or
otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective Contract to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party; or (C) breach, contravene
or violate any applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other antitrust or
competition Law). No review pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall have any effect
for the purpose of determining the accuracy of any representation or warranty
given by any of the parties hereto to any of the other parties hereto.

  

  

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to Section 5.3(a),
Parent shall comply with, and shall cause each Parent Subsidiary and each
Parent Representative to comply with, all of its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement dated February 10, 2011 by and between the Company
and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended as of the date hereof to
permit Parent and its affiliates to take any action permitted to be taken
hereunder, including any action taken by Parent in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal by a Person other than Parent.

  

  

Section 5.4 No Solicitation of Transactions; Change of Company Board
Recommendation.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 5.4(b), from and after the date hereof until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article VII, the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit any of its officers,
directors, or employees to, and shall instruct and cause the Company
Representatives not to on behalf of the Company, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any person, or furnish to any person any
information, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussion or negotiation with any Persons conducted prior to the date hereof
by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a), if,
at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Company securing the
Company Shareholder Approval, (i) the Company has received a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal from a third party that was not solicited after the date
hereof by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives
and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.4 and (ii)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the
Company may, subject to providing prior notice of its decision to take any
such action, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that the Company (x) will not, and
will not allow the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to,
disclose any information to such Person without first entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) will as promptly as practicable
provide to Parent any material information concerning the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person (or its
representatives) which was not previously provided or made available to
Parent.

  

  

(c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company receives any
written Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent informed,
in all material respects, on a prompt basis, of the status, and details of any
such Acquisition Proposal (including any change to the material terms and
conditions thereof) and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in
any event within 24 hours and at least 24 hours prior to making any
determination with respect to such Acquisition Proposal) after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material
(including draft agreements) relating to the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal exchanged between the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (or its representatives), on the other hand.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or take
any action or make any statement inconsistent with the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral
position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be
considered an adverse modification), (iii) following the date any Acquisition
Proposal or any material modification thereto is first made public, sent or
given to the shareholders of the Company, fail to issue a press release that
expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business
Days following Parent's written request to do so (which request may only be
made once with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal and each material
modification thereto) (any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii)
or (iii), a "Change of Company Board Recommendation"),

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) allow or cause the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement relating
to any Acquisition Proposal (which, for the avoidance of doubt, would not
include an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the Company to
abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (v) release any third party from,
grant any waiver of, or fail to enforce, any standstill or similar agreement
or (vi) take any action pursuant to which any Person (other than Parent,
Merger Sub or their respective affiliates) or Acquisition Proposal would
become exempt from or not otherwise subject to any take-over statute or
article of incorporation provision relating to Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(d), at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and so long as
the Company is in compliance with this Section 5.4, if (A) the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel,
constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn
or (B) there occurs any fact, change, event, circumstance, occurrence, effect
or development that affects or would be reasonably likely to affect the
business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that (1) is material,
individually or in the aggregate, with any other such fact, change, event,
circumstance, occurrence, effect or development, (2) does not involve or
relate to an Acquisition Proposal and (3) is not known to the Company Board as
of the date hereof, the Company Board may, in the case of clause "(A)" or
"(B") above, make a Change of Company Board Recommendation if (and only if)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that
the Company Board may not make a Change of Company Board Recommendation unless
(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent that the Company
Board intends to effect a Change of Company Board Recommendation (a "Notice of
Change of Recommendation"), which notice shall specify the reasons therefor
and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, include the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and attach a copy of the most current
draft of any written agreement relating thereto, (ii) the Company has
negotiated in good faith with Parent (including by making the Company's
Representatives reasonably available to negotiate) with respect to any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least five (5)
Business Days following receipt by Parent of such Notice of Change of
Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, any amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation and an additional three (3)
Business Day period from the date of such notice) and (iii) taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the
Company, the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that the failure by it to
make a Change of Company Board Recommendation would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, in the case of a Superior Proposal,
such Superior Proposal continues to meet the definition of the term "Superior
Proposal". The parties agree that nothing in this Section 5.4(e) shall in any
way limit or otherwise affect Parent's right to terminate this Agreement. Any
such Change of Company Board Recommendation shall not (x) change the approval
of this Agreement or any other

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

approval of the Company Board in any respect that would have the effect of
causing any corporate takeover statute or other similar statute or any
provision of the Company Articles to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or (y) change the obligation of the
Company to present this Agreement for approval at the Company Shareholder
Meeting pursuant to Section 5.2(c). Notwithstanding any Change of Company
Board Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of
the Company at the Company Shareholder Meeting for the purpose of approving
the Merger, and nothing contained herein, including any rights of the Company
to take certain actions pursuant to this Section 5.4, shall be deemed to
relieve the Company of such obligation.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(d), at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and so long as
the Company is in compliance with this Section 5.4, if the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, constitutes a
Superior Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn, the
Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f) to enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.4(f), and any
purported termination pursuant to this Section 5.4(f) shall be void, unless
(i) concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Company
Termination Fee and the Parent Transaction Expenses payable pursuant to
Section 7.2(b)(i), (ii) the Company has provided prior written notice to
Parent that the Company intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal"), which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and attach a copy of the definitive
agreement proposed to be entered into with respect to such Superior Proposal,
(iii) the Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent (including by
making the Company's Representatives reasonably available to negotiate) with
respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for
at least five (5) Business Days following receipt by Parent of such Notice of
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any
material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and an additional three (3) Business Day period from the date of such
notice) and (iv) taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company, the Company Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel, that such Superior Proposal continues to meet the definition of the
term "Superior Proposal" and the failure by it to terminate this Agreement to
enter into the definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  

  

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of
the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company (for the
avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the fact that a disclosure or other
action may be deemed

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

permissible by virtue of this sentence does not in and of itself mean that
such disclosure or other action does not constitute a Change of Company Board
Recommendation and the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
shall not constitute a Change of Company Board Recommendation).

  

  

Section 5.5 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

  

  

(a) The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii)
obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent
or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action
or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including those in connection with
the HSR Act and Title 30: Public Service, Vermont Statutes Annotated), in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) cause the
satisfaction of all conditions set forth in Article VI, (iv) vigorously defend
all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory or other proceedings to which it is a
party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case until the issuance
of a final, non-appealable order, (v) seek to have lifted or rescinded any
injunction or restraining order which may adversely affect the ability of the
parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (vi) as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within 60 days after the date
hereof, make or cause to be made all necessary applications and filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required
under or with respect to the Company Required Governmental Approvals, the HSR
Act, Title 30: Public Service, Vermont Statutes Annotated, Section 721 of
Title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended by the Omnibus
Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, and any other applicable Law; provided,
that the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with
determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making
any such filings. The Company and Parent shall furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing under the rules and
regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent shall consent
to any voluntary delay of the Closing at the behest of any Governmental Entity
without the consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Neither Parent nor the Company, directly or
indirectly through one or more of their respective affiliates, shall take any
action, including acquiring or making any investment in any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company or other business organization or any
division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to cause a
material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Article VI
or the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
agrees to take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make, or cause
to be made, any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade
regulation Law or any other Law applicable to the Company, any Company

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Subsidiary or the Merger that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger so as to enable the Effective Time and the Closing,
respectively, to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later
than the Extended Outside Date), including (A) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
(B) accepting any operational restrictions, including restrictions on the
ability to change rates or charges or standards of service, or otherwise
taking or committing to take actions that limit Parent's or any Parent
Subsidiary's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or
freely operate, any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights, product
lines, operations or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Effective Time
or the Closing, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be required to, and the
Company shall not, in connection with obtaining any consents or approvals
hereunder, or in connection with otherwise complying with any provisions of
this Agreement, consent to or take any action of the types described above,
including proposing or making any divestiture or other undertaking or
proposing, accepting or entering into any consent decree, hold separate order
or operational restriction, in each case, that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the exclusions set forth in the
definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed to apply to
any reference to "material adverse effect" in this Section 5.5(a).

  

  

(b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to obtain any
third party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as
applicable; provided, however that the Company and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers
are required to be obtained from parties to any Company Scheduled Contracts in
connection with consummation of the Merger and in seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers. In the event that either party shall fail to
obtain any third party consent described in this Section 5.5(b), such party
shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect
upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to
result, after the Effective Time, as applicable, from the failure to obtain
such consent.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.5,
each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the
other parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other
parties of any communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Justice, the FERC, the FCC, the NRC, the VPSB, CFIUS or any other Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with
the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other
parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party hereto will permit
authorized representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting
or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding.

  

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.5,
Parent shall comply with the terms and conditions of the Order of the VPSB in
Docket No. 6120 and 6460 entered June 26, 2001 (the "Sharing Order") with
regard to sharing with ratepayers and shareholders of the Company any premium
above book value derived from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
up to a maximum sharing of $16 million, as adjusted for inflation.

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete unilateral control and supervision over its business operations.

  

  

Section 5.6 Certain Notices. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party
hereto of: (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be likely to cause any
condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; (b) the
failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; (c) any material actions,
suits, claims or proceedings with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement commenced against the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
Parent, as the case may be (and the Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense and settlement of any shareholder litigation
against the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parent's prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned)); and (d) any written notice or other
written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.6 shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 5.7 Public Announcements. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
stock exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is subject,
in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of, and
shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the Company and Parent.
Prior to making any material written communications to the directors, officers
or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or material oral
communications to a group of directors, officers or employees with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide Parent with a copy of the intended
communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and
comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company shall reasonably
cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

  

  

Section 5.8 Employee Benefit Matters.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period ending on the second
anniversary of the Effective Time (the "Benefit Protection Period"), Parent
shall either (i) assume and maintain, or cause the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to assume and maintain, for the benefit
of the employees of the Company and Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the "Company Employees"), the Company Benefit Plans (other
than the Company Equity Plans) at the benefit levels in effect on the date of
this Agreement and provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to provide compensation and benefits to each Company
Employee under the Company Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans or
compensation arrangements of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries that
have a value sufficient to replace the value of the compensation and benefits
provided to such Company Employee under the Company Benefit Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time (not taking into account the value of equity-based
compensation), or (ii) provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to provide compensation and benefits to each Company
Employee that, taken as a whole, has a value that is not less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation and benefits under the Company Benefit Plans
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (not
taking into account the value of equity-based compensation).

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.8(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue without

arrangements (including any change in control or severance agreement between
the Company and any Company Employee), in each case, as in effect at the
Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply with
applicable Law or as consented to by the parties thereto.

  

  

(c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies,
each Company Employee's service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (as
well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized
by the Company or such Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation,
to the extent such service was credited for similar purposes under a similar
Company Benefit Plan; provided, however, that such service need not be
recognized (i) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan other than any Single Employer Plan, or (ii) to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

  

  

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to waive, or cause to be waived, with respect to the
Company Employees any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively
at work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan
maintained by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in which Company
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or
her eligible dependents) under any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company
Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, to the extent so recognized under such applicable Company
Benefit Plan.

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall: (i) confer
upon any Company Employee or another employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or any other Person, any rights or remedies, including any right
to employment or continued employment for any period or terms of employment,
of any nature whatsoever; (ii) be interpreted to prevent or restrict Parent,
or any Parent Subsidiary, including the Surviving Corporation from modifying
or terminating the employment or terms of employment of any Company Employee
or such other employee including the amendment or termination of any Company
Benefit Plan or any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or
arrangement, after the Effective Time; or (iii) be treated as an amendment or
other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan
or arrangement.

  

  

Section 5.9 Takeover Laws. If any "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"fair price," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Law becomes, or is
deemed to be,

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

applicable to the Merger, including the acquisition of Shares pursuant
thereto, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, shall take all action
reasonably available to it to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

  

  

Section 5.10 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

  

  

(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors,
officers and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the same
extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to applicable Law, the Company
Articles, the Company By-laws, the articles of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational or governing documents, of any Company Subsidiary,
and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement and filed as an exhibit to a Company SEC Document with any
directors, officers, and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless such persons to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law for acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to advance
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the
defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect
to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.10(a) in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company Articles, the Company
By-laws, the articles of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent
organizational documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement and filed as an
exhibit to a Company SEC Document, including any expenses incurred in
enforcing such Person's rights under this Section 5.10, regardless of whether
indemnification with respect to or advancement of such expenses is authorized
under the Company Articles, the Company By-laws, the articles of incorporation
and bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, of any Company Subsidiary,
or such indemnification agreements; provided, however, that the director,
officer or employee to whom expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such
advanced expenses to Parent and the Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately
determined that such director, officer or employee is not entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.10(a). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made
against such persons with respect to matters subject to indemnification
hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 5.10(a) shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

  

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers and
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for periods at or prior
to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Articles and
the

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Company By-laws. The indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the
date of this Agreement and filed as an exhibit to a Company SEC Document with
any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any further
action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms following the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) For the benefit of the Company's directors and officers, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted,
prior to the Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that is substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the Company's
existing policy (true and complete copies which have been previously provided
to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable,
the best available coverage; provided, however, that the portion of the
premium payable in respect of each year of such coverage shall not exceed 300%
of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (which
annual premium is $420,000). If the Company is unable to purchase such DandO
Insurance prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as of the Effective Time,
obtain and fully pay the premium for DandO Insurance that is substantially
equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the
Company's existing policy (true and complete copies which have been previously
provided to Parent); provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of
300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement; and
provided, further, that if the annual premium would at any time exceed 300%,
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to provide the maximum available
coverage as may be obtained for 300% from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating than the primary carrier of the Company's existing
policy. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force
and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder, for a period of
not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

  

  

(e) The obligations under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any past or present
directors, officers and employees of the Company to whom this Section 5.10

beneficiaries of this Section 5.10).

Fee is payable; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit any
party's rights with respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered
by such party as a result of the willful and material breach by another party

in this Agreement (including any such case in which the Company Termination

contemplated by this Agreement are payable pursuant to Section 7.2(b) to
Parent, to the extent any such liability or damage suffered by Parent exceeds
the amount of the Termination Fee and any expenses payable pursuant to Section
7.2(b), it being the intent that any Company Termination Fee and any expenses
paid to Parent shall, to the extent of such payment, serve as credit against
and off-set any liability or damage suffered by Parent as a result of the
willful and material breach by the Company of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53

and Merger Sub by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of
Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that,
after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, no amendment may be made
which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange,
requires further approval by the Company's shareholders without obtaining such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

  

  

Section 7.4 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other,
(b) waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance by the other with any of the covenants or conditions contained
herein; provided, however, that after receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement which
decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of
the Company's shareholders hereunder without the approval of such shareholders
at a duly convened meeting of the Company's shareholders called to obtain
approval of such extension or waiver. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or
parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist
on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.

Section 8.6 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

  

Section 8.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Company Disclosure Letter, Parent Disclosure Letter and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder.

  

  

Section 8.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or
transferred, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of
the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties,
except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
(i) one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ultimate
Parent at any time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; provided,
that no such transfer or assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub from
any of its obligations hereunder. Any assignment or transfer in violation of
the preceding sentence shall be void.

  

  

Section 8.10 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than: (a)
any Persons entitled to indemnification under the provisions of Section 5.10,
with respect to such provisions, who shall be entitled to enforce their rights
under this Agreement as third-party beneficiaries; (b) the shareholders of the
Company, in the event of a termination of this Agreement as a result of a
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, subject to Section 7.2(a),
with respect to the lost opportunity to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the rights granted
pursuant to this clause (b) shall only be enforceable by the Company on behalf
of the shareholders of the Company (and not directly by any such shareholder)
(it being understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims
shall attach to the Shares and subsequently trade and transfer therewith and,
consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received
by the Company with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by the
Company in connection therewith) may, in the Company's sole and absolute
discretion, be (i) distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to the
holders of Shares of record as of any date determined by the Company or (ii)
retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the Company on behalf of
its shareholders in any manner the Company deems fit); and (c) the
shareholders of the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Company, after the Effective Time, with respect to the right of such
shareholders to receive Merger Consideration for any Share such shareholder
holds.

  

  

Section 8.11 Mutual Drafting; Interpretation. Each party hereto has
participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges
is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the
context requires: (i) the singular number shall include the plural, and vice
versa; (ii) the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter
genders; (iii) the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter
genders; and (iv) the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine
genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Except as
otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections" and
"Exhibits," are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits
to this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to
refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the
term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement,
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.12 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, (a)
the Laws of the State of Vermont with respect to matters, issues and questions
relating to the Merger or the fiduciary duties of the Company Board or the
board of directors of Merger Sub and (b) the Laws of the State of Delaware
with respect to all other matters, issues and questions, without regard to
Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the
State of Delaware located in New Castle County, Delaware (or, if such court
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court
within the State of Delaware and any appellate court thereof), in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating hereto or
thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such court,
(ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in such court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such court,
and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such
court located in Delaware. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.3. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to
this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES THE
FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 8.12(c).

  

  

Section 8.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in.pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.14 Specific Performance.

  

  

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that each party
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically in any court of the State of Delaware located in New Castle
County, Delaware (or, if such court declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware and any
appellate court thereof) the terms and provisions hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Without limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree
that prior to the Closing: (i) the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance (A) to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to
prevent or cure breaches of, Section 5.5 by Parent or Merger Sub and (B) if
(x) all conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied and
(y) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing
is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, to prevent or cure
breaches

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub and/or to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, including to cause Parent and/or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to
effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, on the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement; and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to seek specific performance if (A) all conditions in Sections 6.1
and 6.3 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing) have been satisfied and (B) the Company fails to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
Section 1.2, to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement by the Company
and/or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
including to cause the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, on the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. Each party hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other party
has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

  

  

(b) The parties further agree that (i) the seeking of the remedies provided
for in Section 8.14(a) shall not in any respect constitute a waiver by any
party seeking such remedies of its respective right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under
Section 7.2, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the
event that the remedies provided for in Section 8.14(a) are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall
require a party to institute any proceeding for (or limit a party's right to
institute any proceeding for) specific performance under Section 8.14(a) prior
or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article VII (and
pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any
legal proceeding pursuant to Section 8.14(a) or anything set forth in this
Section 8.14(b) restrict or limit a party's right to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of Article VII or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

  

  

Section 8.15 Ultimate Parent Guarantee.

  

  

(a) Ultimate Parent hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally
guarantees to the Company the due, prompt and punctual payment and performance
when due of all of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations and agreements under
this Agreement up to and including the Closing, including the consummation of
the Merger, the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the
performance of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under Section 5.5, it
being understood that Ultimate Parent shall have no obligation to guarantee
any post-Closing obligations or agreements. Ultimate Parent's obligations are
unconditional irrespective of any circumstances which might otherwise
constitute, by operation of law, a discharge of a guarantor and it shall not
be necessary for the Company to institute or exhaust any remedies or causes of
action against Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person as a condition to the
obligations of Ultimate Parent hereunder.

  

  

(b) Ultimate Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Company that it: (i)
is a corporation or other legal entity duly incorporated or organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

has requisite corporate or other legal entity, as the case may be, power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted; (ii) is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or materially impair the
ability of Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to perform its
obligations hereunder; and (iii) owns, directly or indirectly, all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests in
Parent.

  

  

(c) Ultimate Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Company that it: (i)
has the requisite corporate or other legal entity, as the case may be, power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger; (ii) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Ultimate Parent, and the performance by Ultimate Parent of its obligations
hereunder, have been duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate or
other legal entity, as the case may be, action on the part of Ultimate Parent
and no other corporate or other legal entity, as the case may be, proceedings
on the part of Ultimate Parent, and no shareholder or other equityholder
votes, are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to perform its obligations
hereunder; (iii) this Agreement has been duly authorized and validly executed
and delivered by Ultimate Parent and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Ultimate Parent, enforceable against Ultimate Parent in accordance with its
terms, except that (x) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditors' rights generally and (y) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought; and (iv) none of the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement by Ultimate Parent will (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both): (x) conflict with or violate any provision
of the articles of incorporation or bylaws, or any equivalent organizational
or governing documents, of Ultimate Parent; (y) conflict with or violate any
Law applicable to Ultimate Parent or any of its properties or assets; or (z)
require any consent or approval under, violate, conflict with, result in any
breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a default under, or
result in termination or give to others any right of termination, vesting,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Ultimate Parent pursuant to, any
Contract or permit to which Ultimate Parent is a party or by which it or any
of its respective properties or assets are bound, except, with respect to
clauses (y) and (z), for any such conflicts, violations, consents, breaches,
losses, defaults, other occurrences or Liens which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Ultimate Parent to perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

   
 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and Ultimate Parent have
caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by
their respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
