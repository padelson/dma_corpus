NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound by this Agreement, the Parties
agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_THE OFFER_

Section 1.01 _The_ _Offer_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable (but in any event no later than fifteen (15) Business
Days) after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

 

(b) Subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by Purchaser, of the conditions set
forth in _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "), Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) (i) at or as promptly as practicable
following the Expiration Time (in any event, no later than the Business Day
immediately following the date on which the Expiration Time occurs), accept
for payment (the time of acceptance for payment, the " _Offer Acceptance Time_
") and (ii) at or as promptly as practicable following the Expiration Time
(and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days following the date on
which the Expiration Time occurs), pay the aggregate Offer Price (by delivery
of funds to the depositary for the Offer) for, all Company Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser the consideration necessary for
Purchaser to comply with such obligations to accept for payment and pay for
such Company Shares. The Parties agree that the Offer and Purchasers
obligation to accept for payment and pay for all Company Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer in accordance with
the foregoing are not, and shall not be, subject to any condition other than
the Offer Conditions.

(c) Purchaser expressly reserves the right, at any time, in its sole
discretion, to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the
terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not:

 

(i) reduce the number of Company Shares subject to the Offer;

 

(ii) reduce the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer;

 

(iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, the Termination
Condition, or the conditions set forth in _clause (b)_ or _clause (d)_ of
_Exhibit_ __ _ A_;

(iv) add to the Offer Conditions or make any Offer Condition more difficult
to satisfy;

(v) extend the Expiration Time other than in accordance with this Agreement;

(vi) provide a "subsequent offering period" (or any extension thereof) within
the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act; or

(vii) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the Company
Stockholders (other than Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates) or the Company.

Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall not permit Purchaser to, terminate the
Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Time without the prior written consent
of the Company, except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.01_. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) " _Offer Closing_ " means
Purchasers acceptance for payment of the Company Shares validly tendered and
not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, and (B) " _Offer Closing Date_ "
means the date on which the Offer Closing occurs. Parent shall be responsible
for 100% of the fees, costs and expenses (except for the fees, costs and
expenses of the Companys advisors), including any filing fees,
associated with the preparation, filing and mailing of the Offer Documents.

 



2

    

(d) Purchaser shall make the Offer by means of an offer to purchase (the "
_Offer to Purchase_ ") that, among other things, describes the terms of the
Offer and the Offer Conditions. As promptly as practicable on the Commencement
Date, Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under
the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule_ __ _ TO_"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer
to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, a form of summary advertisement,
a form of notice of guaranteed delivery and other customary or required
ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer is made
(collectively, together with any amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Purchaser shall cause the
Offer Documents to include all information required under, and shall
otherwise comply, in all material respects, with applicable Law, including the
Exchange Act, and shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
covenant or representation is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. The Company (i) shall
promptly furnish to Parent all information concerning the Company or any of
its applicable Affiliates required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the
Offer Documents and (ii) unless the Company Board has effected a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, approves of the inclusion of the Company
Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall cause the
information supplied by it or on behalf of it for inclusion in the Offer
Documents, at the respective times the Offer Documents are specifically filed
with the SEC, not to contain any untrue statements of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders, as and to the extent required by
applicable Law, including the Exchange Act. Parent and Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other
Party and correct any information provided by it or on behalf of it for use in
the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that such information becomes false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, and Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case,
as and to the extent required by applicable Law, including the Exchange Act.
Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time before
they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to the Company Stockholders, and
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall consider in good faith any
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the Company or its
counsel. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with
(i) copies of any written comments, and shall provide them with a written
summary of any oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments
and (ii) copies of any written responses thereto or a written summary of any
oral responses thereto. Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review any such responses, and Purchaser
shall consider in good faith any reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested by the Company or its counsel. The Company and its counsel shall
have the right to consult with Parent and Purchaser or their counsel regarding
any discussions or meetings with the SEC or other Governmental Authorities
related to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the extent such consultation is not prohibited by the SEC or
other Governmental Authorities.

 

(e) The Offer shall expire, and the Offer Documents shall provide that the
Offer shall expire, (i) at one (1) minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City
time, on the date that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose,
calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after
(and including the day of) the Commencement Date (such time, the " _Initial
Expiration Time_ ") or (ii) if the Offer has been extended in accordance with
this Agreement, at the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended
(the Initial Expiration Time or such later time to which the Offer has been
extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Time_ "). Parent
and Purchaser agree that, if on any scheduled Expiration Time of the Offer,
any of the Offer Conditions (including the Minimum Tender Condition) is not
satisfied (other than the condition set forth in _clause_ __ _ (h)_ of
_Exhibit A,_ which by its nature is to be satisfied at the Expiration Time)
or, in Purchasers sole 

 



3

    

 discretion, waived (if such Offer Condition is permitted to be waived
pursuant to this Agreement and applicable Law), then Purchaser shall extend
the Offer for successive periods of time of up to five (5) business days each
(for this purpose, calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) (or such longer period as the Parties may agree) in order to
permit the satisfaction of such conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if
at any scheduled Expiration Time the only unsatisfied Offer Condition (other
than the condition set forth in _clause_ __ _ (h)_ of _Exhibit A_ , which by
its nature is to be satisfied at the Expiration Time) is the Minimum Tender
Condition, (i) Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer for more
than a total of twenty (20) business days (for this purpose, calculated
in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) and (ii) if prior
to any scheduled Expiration Time on or after such twentieth (20th) business
day referred to in the foregoing  _clause_ __ _ (_ _i_ _)_ of this proviso
Purchaser has received from the Company a written notice of the Companys
election that Purchaser not so extend the Offer, Purchaser shall not extend
the Offer beyond such scheduled Expiration Time. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the foregoing, (A) Purchaser shall not be required to, and
without the Companys prior written consent, shall not, extend the Offer to a
date later than the End Date and (B) subject to the following _clauses (C)_
and _(D)_ , Purchaser shall not, without the Companys prior written consent,
extend the Offer if all Offer Conditions have been satisfied, (C) Purchaser
shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law,
including applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the
SEC or its staff (including any comments issued by the staff of the SEC to any
of the Parties), or rules of any securities exchange, and (D) if, at the
scheduled Expiration Time, each Offer Condition has been satisfied (other than
the condition set forth in _clause_ __ _ (h)_ of _Exhibit A_ , which by its
nature is to be satisfied at the Expiration Time), or, in Purchasers sole
discretion, waived (if such Offer Condition is permitted to be waived pursuant
to this Agreement and applicable Law), and the proceeds of the Debt Financing
are not available to Parent and Purchaser, in an amount sufficient (in
combination with the Equity Financing) to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then Purchaser shall have the right to extend
the Offer for one or more periods of ten (10) business days each (for this
purpose, calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act) (or such longer period as the Parties may agree) (each such extension
pursuant to this  _clause_ __ _ (D)_, a " _Financing Proceeds Extension_ ").

(f) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Parent shall cause to be provided
to Purchaser, on a timely basis, all of the funds necessary to purchase all
Company Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of
Purchasers obligations under this Agreement.

(g) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer Acceptance Time,
any change shall occur in the outstanding Company Shares because of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, exchange,
consolidation of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price and any other similarly dependent terms shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.

 

(h) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01_,
Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day after
such termination) irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and not
acquire any Company Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated by
Purchaser, or if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.01_ prior to the acceptance for payment and payment for Company Shares in
the Offer, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary
acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law,
all tendered Company Shares to the registered holders thereof.

Section 1.02 _Company Actions_.

(a) As promptly as practicable on the Commencement Date after Purchaser files
the Schedule TO, the Company shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule_ __ _ 14D_ _-9_ ") that shall contain the Company Board
Recommendation (subject to the provisions of

 



4

    

  _Section_ __ _ 6.02_), the Fairness Opinion and a notice of appraisal
rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to include all information required under, and shall otherwise
comply, in all material respects, with applicable Law, including the Exchange
Act, and shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no covenant or
representation is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by
or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Purchaser and Parent shall promptly furnish
to the Company all information concerning Purchaser, Parent or any of their
applicable Affiliates required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the
Schedule 14D-9 and shall cause the information supplied by it or on behalf of
it for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 at the time the Schedule 14D-9 is filed
with the SEC not to contain any untrue statements of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated to holders of Company Shares, as and when required by applicable
Law, including the Exchange Act and, to the extent requested by Parent, the
Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated
to the holders of Company Shares together with the Offer Documents
disseminated to the holders of Company Shares. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly notify the
other Party and correct any information included in, or incorporated by
reference into, the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or
as otherwise required by applicable Law, the Company shall cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders
of Company Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable
Law, including the Exchange Act. So long as the Company Board has not made a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall give Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule
14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company and its counsel shall
consider in good faith any reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested by Parent, Purchaser or their counsel. In addition, so long as the
Company Board has not made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with (i) copies of
any written comments, and shall provide them with a written summary of any
oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
receipt of such comments and (ii) copies of any written responses thereto or a
written summary of any oral responses thereto. So long as the Company Board
has not made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall give
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review any
such written responses, and the Company and its counsel shall consider in good
faith any reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent,
Purchaser or their counsel. Parent and its counsel shall have the right to
consult with the Company and its counsel regarding any discussions or meetings
with the SEC or other Governmental Authorities to the extent related to the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
the extent such consultation is not prohibited by the SEC or other
Governmental Authorities.

 

(b) From time to time as reasonably requested by Purchaser, the Company shall
promptly furnish or cause to be promptly furnished to Purchaser mailing
labels, security position listings, nonobjecting beneficial owner lists and
any other listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the
record or beneficial holders of the Company Shares as of the most recent
practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such information
(including updated lists of holders of the Company Shares and their addresses,
mailing labels, security position listings and nonobjecting beneficial owner
lists) and such other assistance or information as Purchaser or its agents
may reasonably request in communicating with the record and beneficial holders
of Company Shares. Parent and Purchaser shall take such actions as may be
reasonably required to protect the unauthorized disclosure or use of
information received by it pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.02(b)_, and if
this Agreement is terminated, Parent and Purchaser shall deliver to the
Company all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then
in their possession. Without limiting the foregoing, subject to applicable
Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the
Merger, Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in

 confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, the information
contained in any such addresses, labels, listings and lists.

 

(c) The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to
register) the transfer of the Company Common Stock accepted for payment by
Purchaser effective immediately after the Offer Closing.

ARTICLE III

 

 _EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND_

 

 _BOOK-ENTRY SHARES_

 Section 3.01 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any Company
Stockholder:

(i) any Company Shares held in the Companys treasury or held by the Company
or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii) any Company Shares held, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Purchaser or
any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(iii) except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)(_ _i_ _)_ and  _Section_
__ _ 3.01(a)(ii)_, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(b)_ and _Section_ __ _
3.03_, each Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
without any interest thereon and subject to any withholding of Taxes in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.02(f)_; and

(iv) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one (1) share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation
and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation as of immediately after the Closing.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any
change shall occur in the outstanding Company Shares because of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, exchange,
consolidation of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, then the
Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent terms shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

 

Section 3.02 _Payment for Company Shares_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties or Parent and the
applicable Company Stockholders, at the Effective Time, (a) all Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, upon the
cancellation or conversion thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.01_,
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and all holders
of stock certificates (" _Stock Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares ("
_Book_ _-Entry Shares_") representing Company Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as
Company Stockholders, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to each Company Share evidenced thereby as provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 3.01_ (or appraisal rights as provided in _Section_ __ _
3.03_ with respect to Dissenting Shares), and (b) the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed with respect to all Company Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be made on such stock transfer books
after the Effective Time.

 



7

    

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate the Companys current
transfer agent or select a bank or trust company mutually agreeable to Parent
and the Company to act as agent (the " _Depository Agent_ ") for the holders
of Company Shares to receive the Offer Price payable pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 1.01(b)_ and to act as the paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
Company Stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)(iii)_. Parent shall enter into agreements reasonably
acceptable to the Company with the Depository Agent and Paying Agent,
respectively, relating to services to be performed by the Depository Agent in
its capacity as Depository Agent and the Paying Agent in its capacity as
Paying Agent, respectively. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Depository Agent cash
sufficient to make the payment of the aggregate Offer Price payable pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 1.01(b)_, and with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)(iii)_; _provided_ , that the Company shall, at the written request of
Parent, deposit with the Depository Agent and/or the Paying Agent at the
Effective Time such portion of such aggregate consideration from the Companys
Cash on Hand as specified in such request (it being understood that Parent
shall deliver (i) a notice of such request to the Company at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time specifying a preliminary amount of
the Companys Cash on Hand to be deposited by the Company and (ii) its
request to the Company at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Effective
Time specifying the final amount equal to or less than the amount specified in
the notice provided pursuant to the foregoing  _clause_ __ _ (_ _i_ _)_ of
the Companys Cash on Hand to be deposited by the Company) (the amounts
collectively deposited, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate Offer Price in the Offer
and the aggregate Merger Consideration in the Merger. If Parent decides to
invest the Payment Fund, then the Payment Fund shall be invested as reasonably
directed by Parent; _provided_ , that (i) such investments shall be in (A)
short-term obligations of the United States with maturities of no more than
thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States, (B) commercial paper obligations of
issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United States of America,
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively or (C) certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1 billion, and (ii) no such investment shall have a maturity of
more than thirty (30) days. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall become part of the Payment Fund and any amounts in excess of
the amounts payable pursuant to _Article_ __ _ I_ or this _Article_ __ _
III_ shall promptly be paid to Parent upon demand. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the Paying
Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.02(b)_. Nothing in this Agreement and no investment losses resulting from
investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to receive, or Parents and the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay, such holders applicable portion of
the Offer Price or Merger Consideration, as applicable.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event not later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to commence mailing to each Person who
was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Shares (i) in the
case of Stock Certificates, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which shall specify that delivery of Stock Certificates shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Stock Certificates shall pass, upon delivery
of the Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree
and shall be prepared prior to Closing) and (B) customary instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Stock Certificates, and (ii) in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, customary instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Book-Entry Shares, in each case, in exchange for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration with respect to each Company Share evidenced by such
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. Upon (1) in the case
of Stock Certificates, delivery to the Paying Agent of Stock
Certificates, together with a validly executed letter of transmittal, or (2)
in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message" in customary form and such other evidence of surrender, if any, as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request, the holders thereof shall be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each Company Share
evidenced by such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and
the Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Stock Certificates that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper amount

 



8

    

 of Merger Consideration may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Stock Certificates so surrendered are
registered if (I) such Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or such
Stock Certificates shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (II) the
Person requesting such payment shall either (x) pay any transfer or other
Taxes required under applicable Law by reason of such payment or (y)
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent that such transfer Tax either has been paid in full or is not
applicable. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
3.02(c)_, each Stock Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Dissenting
Shares) shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each Company Share
evidenced thereby. No interest shall be paid on the portion of the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Stock Certificate or Book-Entry
Share.

 

(d) If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  _Section_ __ _ 3.02(c)_, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Stock Certificate, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay to such Person the Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)(iii)_ with respect to each Company Share
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate.

 

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments
thereof) that remains undistributed to former holders of Stock Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares one (1) year after the Closing Date shall be delivered
by the Paying Agent to Parent upon demand. Any former holders of Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
_Section_ __ _ 3.02_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
or Parent for payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration, in
accordance with this _Article_ __ _ III_ and without any interest thereon,
payable with respect to each Company Share previously evidenced by such Stock
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for the portion
of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to
the date that any unclaimed portion of the Merger Consideration would
otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar laws,
any unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Stock Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(f) Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent and
Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent
to deduct and withhold) from the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration
payable to any holder of Company Common Stock or any holder of Company Equity
Awards or any other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
or such amounts as it is required by Law to deduct and withhold with respect
to Taxes. Each such payor shall timely remit the amounts so withheld to the
appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock, holder of Company Equity
Awards or other recipient of consideration hereunder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.03  _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of such
Company Shares who are entitled to demand and who properly exercise appraisal
rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled
only to the right to receive payment of the appraised value of such Company
Shares in accordance with the provisions of

 



9

    

 Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or
effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such rights, such Company Shares will
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon and subject to any withholding of
Taxes. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt written notice of any written
demand for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of
Dissenting Shares and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not make any payment, settle or offer to
settle, or, in each case, agree to do any of the foregoing, with respect to
any such demand without Parents prior written consent.

Section 3.04  _Equity Awards_.

(a) Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties or the Parent and the
applicable Company Option holders, at the Effective Time, each Company Option
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of
(A) the Offer Price over (B) the per-share exercise price for such Company
Option, _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of Company Shares underlying
such Company Option, without interest (the " _Company Option Consideration_
"); _provided_ , that, if the per-share exercise price of any such Company
Option is equal to or greater than the Offer Price, such Company Option shall
be canceled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in
respect thereof and shall have no further force or effect. The Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
the Company Option Consideration to each holder of a Company Option, less any
Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(f)_, if such holder is
Continuing Company Personnel, through the payroll of the
Surviving Corporation, and if such holder is not Continuing Company
Personnel, then Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make such payment, in
each case, within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time.

 

(b) Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties or the Parent and the
applicable Company RSU holders, at the Effective Time, each Company RSU that
is outstanding and vested by its terms immediately prior to the Effective Time
(taking into account any accelerated vesting thereof as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), shall be canceled and converted
into the right of the holder of such Company RSU to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Company Shares underlying such Company RSU, _multiplied by_ (ii) the Offer
Price (the " _Company RSU Consideration_ "). Unless otherwise mutually agreed
by the Parties or the Parent and the applicable Company RSU holders, at the
Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that will not by its terms vest as of the Effective Time,
shall be assumed and substituted without any action on the part of the holder
thereof (the " _Substituted RSUs_ "), and subject to compliance with Section
409A of the Code, the Substituted RSUs shall remain subject to the same terms
and conditions thereof (including, without limitation, all vesting, settlement
and forfeiture terms and accelerated vesting on specific terminations of
employment, to the extent applicable), as were applicable under such Company
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (A) for changes to certain
terms and conditions rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or for such other administrative or
ministerial changes that are not materially detrimental to the holder thereof
and that in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are
necessary to conform the administration of the Substituted RSUs and
the Surviving Corporation and (B) that upon vesting and settlement of any
Substituted RSUs, the holder thereof shall be entitled to the amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Company
Shares underlying such Company RSU that would have become vested pursuant to
its terms, multiplied by (ii) the Offer Price (the " _Substituted RSU
Consideration_ "), payable at the same time as such Company RSUs for which
Substituted RSUs were assumed and substituted would have been settled
pursuant to its terms. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, pay the Company RSU Consideration to each holder
of a Company RSU, 

 



10

    

 less any Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(f)_, if such holder
is Continuing Company Personnel, through the payroll of the Surviving
Corporation, and if such holder is not Continuing Company Personnel, then
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make such payment, in each case, within
five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time. The Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay the Substituted RSU Consideration to each
holder of a Substituted RSU and on the applicable vesting and settlement date
for such Substituted RSU. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company RSU which
immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation"
subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement
date for such Company RSU if required in order to comply with Section 409A of
the Code.

(c) Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties or the Parent and the
applicable Company PSU holders, at the Effective Time, each Company PSU that
is outstanding and vested by its terms immediately prior to the Effective Time
(taking into account any accelerated vesting thereof as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), shall be canceled and converted
into the right of the holder of such Company PSU to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Company
Shares underlying such Company PSU, _multiplied by_  (ii) the Offer Price
(the " _Company PSU Consideration_ "). Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the
Parties or the Parent and the applicable Company PSU holders, at the Effective
Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that will not by its terms vest as of the Effective Time, shall be
assumed and substituted without any action on the part of the holder thereof
(the " _Substituted PSUs_ "), and subject to compliance with Section 409A of
the Code, the Substituted PSUs shall remain subject to the same terms and
conditions thereof (including, without limitation, all vesting, settlement and
forfeiture terms and accelerated vesting on specific terminations of
employment, to the extent applicable) as were applicable under such Company
PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (A) any performance-based
vesting condition to which such Company PSU is subject shall be treated
as having been attained at target achievement levels, such that the
Substituted PSU will remain subject to the time-based vesting condition in
effect for such Company PSU, (B) for changes to certain terms and conditions
rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial changes that are not
materially detrimental to the holder thereof and that in the reasonable and
good faith determination of Parent are necessary to conform the
administration of the Substituted PSUs and the Surviving Corporation and (C)
that upon vesting and settlement of any Substituted PSUs, the holder thereof
shall be entitled to the amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Company Shares underlying such Company PSU
that would have become vested pursuant to its terms (treating for this purpose
any performance-based vesting condition to which such Company PSU is subject
as having been attained at target achievement levels), _multiplied by_ (ii)
the Offer Price (the " _Substituted PSU Consideration_ "), payable at the same
time as such Company PSUs for which Substituted PSUs were assumed
and substituted would have been settled pursuant to its terms. The Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
the portion of the Company PSU Consideration, less any required withholding
Taxes, payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.04(c)_ through the payroll
of the Surviving Corporation (to the extent such Person is Continuing Company
Personnel, and if such Person is not Continuing Company Personnel, the Paying
Agent shall make such payment), to each holder of a Company PSU within five
(5) Business Days following the Effective Time. The Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay the Substituted PSU Consideration to each holder
of a Substituted PSU and on the applicable vesting and settlement date for
such Substituted PSU. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company PSU which immediately
prior to such cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation" subject to
Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for
such Company PSU if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the appropriate
committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for, and shall take all
other actions that are necessary to effect, the treatment of the Company
Equity Awards as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.04_.

 



11

    

Section 3.05 _No Dividends or Distributions_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
with a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to any holder
of any unsurrendered Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 

Section 3.06 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name
of Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except (x) as set forth in the Company Reports publicly available and filed
with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding
any risk factor or forward-looking disclosures contained in such documents
under the heading "Risk Factors" and any disclosure of risks included in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer or other statements that are similarly
nonspecific or predictive, cautionary or forward-looking), (y) as set forth
in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent and Purchaser
concurrently with the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), or (z) any exception or disclosure
set forth in any other section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter
to the extent it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that
such exception or disclosure is applicable to qualify such representation and
warranty of this  _Article_ __ _ IV_, the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Purchaser as follows:

 

Section 4.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each Company Entity is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, if such
jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the Company
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, as applicable, would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each

business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its businesses or the
ownership, operation or leasing of its assets make such

Section 4.06 _Company Reports; _ _Financial Statements_.

(a) The Company has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and other information
incorporated therein) required to be furnished or filed by the Company with
the SEC since June 30, 2016 (such documents, together with all exhibits,
financial statements, including the Company Financial Statements, and
schedules and amendments thereto and all information incorporated therein by
reference, but excluding the Schedule 14D-9, being collectively referred to as
the " _Company Reports_ "). Each Company Report (i) at the time furnished or
filed, complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), as applicable,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to
such Company Report and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if amended
or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement,
then at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company
Reports (the " _Company Financial Statements_ ") complied at the time it was
filed as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited
quarterly financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods and as of the dates involved (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and the Companys
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case
of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to the absence of footnote
disclosure and to normal fiscal year-end adjustments). There are no
unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the Company or any off-balance sheet
arrangements of the type required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4)
of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. True, correct and complete copies
of all Company Reports are publicly available in the Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval database of the SEC. To the Knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company Reports are the subject of ongoing SEC review or
outstanding 

 



15

    

 SEC comment or other governmental inquiries or investigations regarding the
accounting practices of the Company.

 

(b) No Company Entity has any liability that is required by GAAP to be set
forth on a consolidated audited balance sheet of the Company Entities or
disclosed in the footnotes thereto, except liabilities: (i) reflected or
reserved against in the most recent balance sheet (including the notes
thereto) of the Company Entities included in the Company Reports filed prior
to the date of this Agreement; (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of
business since the date of the most recent balance sheet included in the
Company Financial Statements; (iii) incurred in connection with the Offer or
the Merger or any other transaction or agreement contemplated by this
Agreement; or (iv) that are not, and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(c) The Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the
Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP in all material respects. The Company (i) maintains
"disclosure controls and procedures" required by Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act that are effective to ensure the
reliability of financial reporting and that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis
to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings
with the SEC and other public disclosure documents and (ii) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to
the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board
(A) any significant deficiency and material weakness in the design or
operation of the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that is reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, known to the Company, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
The Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2017, and such assessment concluded that such system was
effective. Since June 30, 2016, none of the Company, the Company Board, the
audit committee of the Company Board or, to the Companys Knowledge, the
Companys auditors has received any written, or to the Companys Knowledge,
oral notification of any matter set forth in the preceding _clause (A)_ or
_(B)_.

 

(d) With respect to any Company Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company that
accepts insurance or reinsurance risk, as those terms are commonly understood
under applicable Laws (such entities collectively, " _Insurance Subsidiaries_
"), have maintained and filed all financial statements required by applicable
Laws (" _Statutory Statements_ "). The loss reserves reflected in the
Insurance Subsidiaries most recent Statutory Statements: (i) have been
computed and determined in accordance with then generally accepted actuarial
standards consistently applied, (ii) are fairly stated in accordance with
sound actuarial principles and (iii) have been computed on the basis of
assumptions consistent with those used in computing the corresponding reserves
in all prior-filed Statutory Statements, in each case, except as has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 Jefferies Finance LLC (the " _Lender_ ", and the Lender, together with its
Affiliates and its and its Affiliates respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives and the respective successors and
assigns of the foregoing, the " _Lender Related Parties_ ") and Parent, (b)
the related fee letter (the " _Fee Letter_ ", and collectively with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the " _Debt Letters_ ") redacted in a customary manner
solely with respect to the fees, pricing caps, and certain economic terms
(including economic flex terms), which redacted information does not adversely
affect the amount, availability, or conditionality of the funding of the Debt
Financing, in each case, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and
amendments to such letters in effect as of the date hereof, pursuant to which
and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Lender has committed to
lend the amounts set forth therein to Purchaser (the provision of such funds
as set forth therein, the " _Debt Financing_ ") for the purposes set forth in
such Debt Commitment Letter and (c) an equity commitment letter, (the "
_Equity Commitment Letter_ " and together with the Debt Letters, the "
_Commitment Letters_ "), dated as of the date hereof, between Sponsor and
Purchaser, pursuant to which Sponsor has committed to invest the amounts set
forth therein in connection with the transactions contemplated herein (the "
_Equity Financing_ " and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_
"). The Commitment Letters (i) have not been amended, restated or otherwise
modified or waived prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been
withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and (ii) to the
Knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal, rescission, amendment, restatement,
modification or waiver is contemplated (other than any such amendment,
modification, or restatement to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who have not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof). As of the date of this Agreement,
the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and the other parties thereto,
subject in each case to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. There are no
conditions precedent or contingencies directly or indirectly related to the

into account the portion of the Companys Cash on Hand that the Company is
obligated to deposit with the Depository Agent and/or the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(b)_, Parent and Purchaser will have
sufficient funds to pay all of Parents and Purchasers obligations under
this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Offer Price and Merger
Consideration and all fees and expenses expected to be incurred in connection
therewith. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred or
circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent under the
Commitment Letters or any other party to the Commitment Letters or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, otherwise result in any portion of the Financing to be
unavailable. As of the date of this Agreement there are no side letters or
other agreements, Contracts, arrangements or understandings (written or oral)
directly or indirectly related to the funding of the Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters. Parent has paid in full any and
all commitment fees and other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date
hereof under the terms of the Commitment Letters and will pay all other
commitment fees and other fees as required to be paid under the terms of the
Commitment Letters upon the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent
(A) is not aware of any fact, event or other occurrence that makes any of the
representations or warranties of Purchaser in any of the Commitment Letters
inaccurate in any material respect and (B) has no reason to believe that any
of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters
will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letters will not be made available on the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.07 _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Sponsor has delivered to the Company the Limited Guarantee
executed by Sponsor. The Limited Guarantee is valid and in full force and
effect and constitutes the valid and binding obligations of Sponsor,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exceptions. No event has occurred that would constitute a breach or
default (or with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default)
by Sponsor under the Limited Guarantee.

No such fees and expenses will be required to be paid by the Company.

Section 5.09 _Purchaser_. The authorized capital stock of Purchaser consists
of one thousand (1,000) shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share.
All outstanding shares of capital stock of Purchaser are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Parent owns, directly
or indirectly, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Purchaser.
Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Offer, the

assets, engage in any business activities or conduct any operations, in each
case, other than in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 Section 5.10 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Except as set forth in
Section 5.10 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, none of Parent, any Subsidiary
of Parent or any other Affiliate of Parent "beneficially owns" (as such term

Shares or any other Equity Securities. There are no voting trusts or other
agreements or understandings to which Parent or Purchaser or any Person
controlling or controlled by Parent or Purchaser is a party, with respect to
the voting of the Company Common Stock.

 

Section 5.11 _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy, in all material respects, of
the representations and warranties of the Company in _Article_ __ _ IV_ that
relate to the subject matter of _clauses (a)_ through _(c)_ of the second
sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, after giving effect to the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the payment
of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement (including payment of all
amounts payable under _Article_ __ _ I_ and _Article_ __ _ II_ in
connection with or as a result of the Offer or the Merger) and the payment of
all related fees and expenses, Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (including the Company Entities) shall be Solvent as of the
Offer Closing Date and as of the Closing Date immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to
any Person, shall mean that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount
of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such
date, exceed (i) the sum of the value of all "liabilities of such Person,
including contingent and other liabilities" as of such date, and the capital
of such Person as computed in accordance with applicable Law as of such date,
as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the
amount that shall be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person
on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such
debts become absolute and mature, (b) such Person shall not have, as of such
date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged after such date,
and (c) such Person shall be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent
and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not
have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of
the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to
pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature" mean that such Person shall be able to generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancings, or a combination thereof, to
meet its obligations as they become due. Parent is not entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company Entities.

Section 5.12 ___No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article_ __ _ IV_,
each of Parent and Purchaser (a) (i) specifically acknowledges and agrees that

materiality of any Projection and (ii) any Affiliate of the Company or the
Companys or any such Affiliates respective Representatives or equity
holders, and hereby specifically acknowledges and agrees that such Affiliate
of the Company or the Companys or any such Affiliates respective
Representatives or equity holders shall have no liability or obligations,
based on, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution, performance or subject matter of this Agreement, including (A) for
any alleged nondisclosure or misrepresentations made by any such Person or (B)
in connection with accuracy, completeness or materiality of any Projection.
Each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (1) it has
conducted its own independent investigation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including with respect to the Company Entities and their
respective businesses, operations, assets and liabilities) and, in making its
determination to enter into this Agreement and proceed with the transactions

terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal or any such
inquiry or proposal by contacting the third party making such inquiry,
proposal or offer solely for such purpose. The Company shall, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease all existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with
any third party conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to
any Company Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information previously furnished and promptly terminate all
physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such third
party or its Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, in response to the receipt
of a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal made after the date of this
Agreement that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ and
that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor) constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal, the Company and
its Representatives may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company
Entities to the third party making such Company Takeover Proposal (and such
third partys Representatives) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , that all such information has previously been
provided to Parent or its Representatives or is provided to Parent or its
Representatives prior to or promptly after (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) the provision of such information to such third party, and
(B) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover
Proposal, including terms of a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect
thereto, and the negotiation of such terms and such Company
Acquisition Agreement with the third party making such Company Takeover
Proposal (and such third partys Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, (I) the Company may grant a waiver, amendment
or release under any confidentiality agreement, standstill agreement or
similar agreement solely to the extent necessary to allow a Company Takeover
Proposal to be made to the Company or the Company Board (or any committee
thereof), and (II) the Parties agree that, by execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall be deemed to have waived, as of immediately prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, any provision in any such agreement
solely to the extent necessary to allow the applicable counterparty to convey
a Company Takeover Proposal to the Company or the Company Board (or any
committee thereof).

(b) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_
and _Section_ __ _ 6.02(f)_, the Company Board shall not: (i) withdraw,
change, qualify, withhold or modify in any manner adverse to Parent, or
propose publicly to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation; (ii) adopt,
approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or propose
publicly to adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable, any Company Takeover Proposal; (iii) fail to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9; (iv) fail to publicly reaffirm
the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after Parent so
requests in writing following

 



35

    

 any public disclosure of a Company Takeover Proposal; or (v) take or fail to
take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public
statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer (except for a
recommendation against any such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen"
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) (any action in the foregoing _clauses_ __ _ (_ _i_ _)_ through _(v)_
being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Except as
set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_ and any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company Board shall not authorize, permit, approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or
allow the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
agreement or commitment constituting, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or that would
reasonably be expected to cause, the Company to abandon or terminate this
Agreement (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, in response to the Companys receipt of a
Superior Company Proposal from any third party, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ , in each case, (x) if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ , as applicable, would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) such Superior Company
Proposal did not result from a material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not make such a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or so terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ unless: (i) the Company Board has delivered
to Parent prior written notice at least four- (4-) Business Days (or two-
(2-) Business Days with respect to a "new written notice" delivered pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_) in advance that the Company Board is
prepared to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ (a " _Recommendation
Change Notice_ "), which Recommendation Change Notice shall state (A) that
the Company has received a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal that has not
been withdrawn and that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
concluded in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Company Proposal; (B) to
the extent not previously provided pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.02(e)_, the
material terms of such Company Takeover Proposal, the identity of the third
party making such Company Takeover Proposal and a copy of such Company
Takeover Proposal made in writing and any other written terms and proposals
provided (including financing commitments) to the Company and
its Representatives; and (C) that the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ absent revisions to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the
basis for such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination; and (ii)
if requested by Parent, during the four- (4-) Business Day period (or two-
(2-) Business Day period with respect to a "new written notice" delivered
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_) after delivery of the
Recommendation Change Notice, the Company and its Representatives negotiate in
good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to this
Agreement committed to in writing by Parent so that such Company Takeover
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Company Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if any material revisions are made to any such Superior
Company Proposal, the Company Board shall promptly (but in no event more than
twenty-four (24) hours) provide a new written notice notifying Parent of such
revisions in writing and comply with the requirements of this  _Section_ __ _
6.02(c)_ with respect to such new written notice, it being understood that the
two- (2-) Business Day period referenced in _clause (ii)_ of this sentence
shall apply to any such new written notices.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, in response to a Company Intervening
Event, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the failure
to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company Board may not make such Company Adverse Recommendation

 



36

    

 Change unless the Company Board has delivered to Parent a Recommendation
Change Notice identifying such Company Intervening Event and, if requested by
Parent, during the four- (4-) Business Day period after delivery of the
Recommendation Change Notice, the Company and its Representatives negotiate in
good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to this
Agreement committed to in writing by Parent so that such Company Intervening
Event no longer necessitates a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(e) Reasonably promptly (but in no event more than twenty-four (24) hours)
following receipt by the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, its
Representatives of any Company Takeover Proposal from a third party, the
Company shall notify Parent in writing of (i) the receipt of any Company
Takeover Proposal; (ii) the identity of the third party making such Company
Takeover Proposal; (iii) a copy of any such Company Takeover Proposal made in
writing and any other written terms and proposals provided (including
financing commitments) to the Company and its Representatives; and (iv) a
written summary of material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover
Proposal not made in writing. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed in all material respects on a reasonably prompt basis of the
material terms and status of discussions or negotiations with respect to, and
supplementally provide any change to the material terms of, any such Company
Takeover Proposal (including as required by the foregoing _clauses (_ _i_ _)_
through _(iv)_ ) and any amendments thereto.

(f) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ shall prohibit the Company from (i)
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders if, in the good-faith
judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with the Companys outside
legal counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable Law, it being understood that any such
disclosure made by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02(f)_ shall not otherwise limit or affect the obligations
of the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) or the rights of
Parent under this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, it being understood that nothing in
the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change other
than in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement
that describes the Companys receipt of a Company Takeover Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any confidentiality
agreement with the Company that contains customary confidentiality, use,
standstill and other provisions that, in each case, are not less favorable to
the Company in any material respect than such corresponding terms in the
Company Confidentiality Agreement, it being understood that
such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making of private
proposals to the Board of the Company.

(ii) " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or
not in writing) from any third party, with respect to any (A) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,

disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint

representing 25% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of
the Company Entities, taken as a whole, (C) issuance, sale or other

(iii) " _Superior Company Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Company
Takeover Proposal made by a third party ( _provided_ , that, for purposes of

"25% or more" shall be deemed references to "more than 50%"), which the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, and taking into account the
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Company Takeover
Proposal (including the likelihood and timing of closing and whether such
Company Takeover Proposal is fully financed), the identity of the Person
making the proposal and such other factors that are deemed relevant by the
Company Board, is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its
terms, and if consummated, would be more favorable to the Company
Stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account
any proposed revisions to the terms of this Agreement that are committed to
in writing by Parent (including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_)).

 

(iv) " _Company Intervening Event_ " means any Effect that (A) is unknown to

changes after the date of this Agreement in the market price, credit rating or
trading volume of Company Shares on NASDAQ or any change affecting
the ratings or the ratings outlook for any Company Entity; _provided_ , that,
in the case of _clause (y)_ , the underlying reasons for such events or
changes may constitute a Company Intervening Event under the foregoing _clause
(A)_.

by any of its Representatives, to the extent acting on behalf of the Company,
that, if taken by the Company, would be a breach of this _Section_ __ _

Company.

 

Section 6.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, provide Parent

above the level of vice president, subject to the Companys right, in respect
of employees and customers to consent and comment on any communications made

with such employees or customers, in each case for any reasonable business
purpose; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that: (i) any failure to timely deliver a
Cash Flow Report shall not constitute a breach of covenant in any material
respect for purposes of _clause_ __ _ (f)_ of _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ or
give rise to any right of termination under _Article_ __ _ VIII_, (ii) any
such access shall be conducted at Parents expense, at a reasonable time,

Company Entity and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
normal operation of the business of the Company Entities; and (iii) the
Company may withhold from Parent or its Representatives any document or
information to the extent that the Company believes that such document or
information (A) is subject to the terms of a Contract to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound, and access to such
Contract would 

 



38

    

 materially violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third party the
right to terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract (
_provided_ , that the Company, upon the written request of Parent, shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such
third party to disclose such document or information), (B) is subject to any
attorney-client or other legal privilege ( _provided_ , that the Company,
upon the written request of Parent, shall use its commercially reasonable

parties or (D) would violate any Law ( _provided_ , that the Company, upon
the reasonable written request of Parent, shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner
that does not violate Law). Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any
access or make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_
to the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a
litigation where the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and
Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties.

6.03_ shall be subject to the letter agreement, dated as of January 9, 2018,
between the Company and HGGC, LLC (the " _Confidentiality_ _Agreement_ "),
as if each of Parent and Purchaser were subject to the obligations of HGGC,
LLC under the Confidentiality Agreement (including as it relates to its
respective Representatives who receive such documents and information). No
termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any
Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, which rights, obligations and
agreements will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
the terms therein.

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties shall be permitted to redact

Agreement to, and the Company will not (and will cause its Subsidiaries not
to) without the prior written consent of Parent, sell, divest, license or hold
separate any capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether
tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses, or to take or commit

effectiveness of such action is conditioned upon the Closing.

 

(c) The Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to,
take any action, including acquiring any asset, property, business or Person

combination, asset, stock or equity purchase, or otherwise), in each case,
that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect obtaining or making

40

    

 case, sufficiently before the End Date in order to allow Closing by the End
Date), which actions shall include the following:

or permanent, that is in effect that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of, or impedes, interferes with or delays, the Closing on or
before the End Date; and (C) effecting the expiration or termination of any
waiting period, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing,
prohibiting or restricting consummation of the Closing or impeding,

Property, the Company shall, between the date hereof and the Closing, use all
commercially reasonable efforts to correct any deficiencies in the title to
any such Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by any Company
Entity and specified by Purchaser, including the filing of inventor
assignments and all other documents necessary or desirable to correct all
such deficiencies.

regarding any Transaction Litigation. Without limiting the preceding sentence,
the Company shall give Parent (a) the opportunity to review and comment on all
Filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any
Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall consider any such comments in
good faith, and (b) the opportunity to participate in (but not control) the
defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation which
participation shall be at Parents sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement
regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement
regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in
writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 

Section 6.06 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including

requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3

reasonably concludes may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. The Company and Parent agree
that the initial joint press release to be issued with respect to this
Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the Parties. Nothing in this

to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company Entities as provided in their
respective Organizational Documents and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of any Company Entity, in each case, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement and made available to Parent, shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms, following the Effective Time, (it being
agreed that after the Closing such rights shall be mandatory rather than
permissive, if applicable), and Parent shall, following the Effective Time,
cause the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to perform their
respective obligations thereunder. Parent shall not permit any such
indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation provision to be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights of the Company Indemnified
Parties thereunder, unless any such amendment, repeal or modification is
required by applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and
hold harmless each individual who was prior to or is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of any Company Entity or who was prior to or is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at
the request of any Company Entity as a director or officer (the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Company Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of any
Company Entity or is or was serving at the request of any Company Entity as a
director or officer, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the
event of any Claim regarding the foregoing, (i) each Company Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any such Claim from Parent within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by
Parent from the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ ,
that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and
only to the extent required by applicable Law or the applicable Company
Entitys Organizational Documents or any applicable indemnification

 



42

    

 agreement, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final
adjudication that such person was not entitled to indemnification, (ii) Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the defense of
such Claim after the Effective Time, and (iii) subject to the foregoing clause
(ii), each Company Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Claim with his or her own counsel. Any determination required
to be made with respect to whether any Company Indemnified Partys conduct
complies with an applicable standard under applicable Law, the applicable
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries or
applicable indemnification agreements, as the case may be, shall be made by
independent legal counsel selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company Indemnified Party.

Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, assume the covenants and agreements set forth in this  _Section_
__ _ 6.09_.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, in
either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms
not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having
a credit rating at least as favorable as the Companys existing carriers with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance), except that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation
be required to pay, in the aggregate, with respect to such insurance policies
more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium of the most recent annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Maximum Amount_ ") and, if Parent or the Surviving Corporation is unable to
obtain the insurance required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.09(c)_, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible
for the years within such six (6) year period for no more than the Maximum
Amount, in respect of such policy. In lieu of such insurance, prior to
the Closing Date the Company may, at its option and in consultation with
Parent, purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy
and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Company and its current
and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors
and officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained
by the Company, such tail insurance to provide coverage in an amount not less
than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the
insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time for a period of not less than six (6) years after
the Closing Date; _provided_ , that in no event shall the aggregate cost of
any such tail insurance exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ (i) shall survive
consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the
Company Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives,
all of which, are express third-party beneficiaries of this  _Section_ __ _
6.09_ and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by
contract or otherwise including under the Organizational Documents.

Person attempts or purports to terminate or repudiate any Commitment Letter,
whether or not such attempted or purported termination or repudiation is
valid);

(ii) Parent obtains Knowledge of any breach or default or any threatened
breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without due
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to any Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Commitment Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing;

 

(iii) Parent receives any communication (written or oral) from any Person with

or disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letters;

 

(iv) any Financing Party refuses to provide or expresses (orally or in
writing) an intent to refuse to provide all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters on the terms set forth therein (or
expresses (orally or in writing) that such Person does not intend to enter
into all or any portion of definitive documentation related to the Financing
or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby); or

(v) there occurs any event or development that could reasonably be expected
to adversely impact the ability of Parent to obtain all, or any portion of,
the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of
the Commitment Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing
or if at any time for any other reason Parent no longer believes in good faith
that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the
terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any
of the Commitment Letters or the definitive documents related to the
Financing.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days after the date the Company delivers to Parent a written request
therefor), Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in _Sections 6.14(c)(_ _i_
_)_ through _6.14(c)(v)_.

(e) Parent may amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under
the Commitment Letters without the prior written approval of the Company;
_provided_ , that Parent shall not, without Companys prior written consent,
permit any such amendment, modification, termination, assignment or waiver to
be made to any provision of or remedy under the Commitment Letters which would
(i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount), (ii) impose new or
additional conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify
any of the conditions to the Financing or (iii) otherwise expand, amend,
modify or waive any provision of the Commitment Letters in a manner that in
any such case would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or make less likely
the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on the Offer Closing Date, (B) adversely impact the ability
of Parent to enforce its rights against the Financing Parties or any other
parties to the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto or (C) adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Commitment Letters or timely consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. In the event
that new commitment letters or fee letters are entered into in accordance with
any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the
Commitment Letters permitted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.14(e)_, Parent
shall promptly deliver to the Company a true, complete and accurate copy
thereof (and in the case of the Fee Letter, redacted in a manner consistent
with _Section_ __ _ 5.06_). For purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"Commitment Letters" and "Fee Letter" shall include and mean such documents as
amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced in compliance with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.14(e)_, and references to "Financing" shall include and mean
the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as so amended,
supplemented, modified, waived or replaced, as applicable.

(f) If the funds with respect to all or any portion of the Financing expire or
are terminated or all or any portion thereof become unavailable or it becomes
reasonably likely that any portion of the Financing may become unavailable on
the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in
the Commitment Letters, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event to (i) notify
the Company in writing thereof and the reasons therefor, (ii) arrange and
obtain, at its sole expense, substitute financing sufficient to enable Parent
to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with its terms (the " _Substitute Financing_ ") and (iii)
obtain a new debt commitment letter or equity commitment letter, as
applicable, that provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after
execution thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of
the new commitment letter and the related fee letters (in the case of the fee
letters, redacted in a manner consistent with _Section_ __ _ 5.06_) and
related definitive financing documents with respect to such Substitute

 



47

    

 Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such Substitute Financing shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (A) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount), (B) impose new or additional
conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any of
the conditions to the Financing or (C) otherwise expand, amend or modify any
provision of the Commitment Letters in a manner that in any such case would
reasonably be expected to (1) delay or make less likely the funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Offer
Closing Date, (2) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the Financing Parties or any other parties to the Commitment Letters
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or (3) adversely affect the
ability of Parent to timely consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such
Substitute Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and each debt commitment letter or equity commitment letter, as
applicable, for such Substitute Financing shall be deemed a "Commitment
Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(g) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Commitment Letters.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and Purchaser expressly acknowledge and agree that neither Parents,
Purchasers nor any of their respective Affiliates obligations hereunder are
conditioned in any manner upon Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates obtaining the Financing, any Substitute Financing or any other
financing.

a breach of covenant in any material respect for purposes of _clause (f)_ of
_Exhibit A_ , or give rise to any right of termination under  _Article_ __ _
VIII_.

(b) At all times during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement
and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VIII_ and the Effective Time, Parent

consummate the Offer or Merger unlikely at the Offer Closing or Closing,
respectively; _provided_ , that no such notice will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or

the Company to consummate the Offer or the Merger or the remedies available to
the Parties under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to

_however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement

Agreement such that the Company would be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _i)_.

(e) _Termination Procedure_. This Agreement may be terminated only pursuant
to _Sections_ __ _ 8.01(a)_ through _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)_. Termination of

this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is effected.

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is validly terminated
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, this Agreement shall immediately become
void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of
the Company, Parent, the Sponsor or the Lender or Lender Related Parties (or
any Affiliate or Representative thereof or any Company Related Party or
Parent Related Party), whether arising before or after such termination, based
on, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution, performance or subject matter of this Agreement (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law
or by statute) or in equity), except for (a) _ Section_ __ _ 1.01(h)_,
_Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.08_, this _Section_ __ _ 8.02_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.03_, _Section_ __ _ 8.05_ and _Article_ __ _ IX_ (and all
defined terms appearing in such sections), which provisions shall survive
such termination, and (b) subject to the limitations of _Section_ __ _ 8.03_
and _Section_ __ _ 8.05_, liability of any Party (whether or not the
terminating Party) for any Intentional Breach of this Agreement by any Party
prior to such termination, which liabilities shall survive the termination of
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Intentional Breach_ " means
a breach of this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or omission
undertaken by the breaching Party with the actual knowledge or actual intent
that the taking of, or the omission of taking, such act would constitute a
material breach of this Agreement;  _provided_ , that, without limiting the
meaning of Intentional Breach, (i) any failure by any Purchaser to commence
the Offer Closing when required under _Section_ __ _ 1.01(a)_ or (ii) any
failure of Parent or Purchaser to consummate the Merger when required under
_Section_ __ _ 2.03_ shall constitute an Intentional Breach by Parent and
Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, the agreements of the parties contained in the

 



53

    

 Confidentiality Agreement and the Limited Guarantee shall survive the
termination of this Agreement (in the case of the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Limited Guarantee, subject to the terms thereof).

Section 8.03 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) If the Company validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ or Parent validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(_ _i_ _)_ , the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of
$18,388,081 in cash (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "). In the event of a
termination under  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ , the Company shall
pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent (to an account designated in writing
by Parent) concurrently with or prior to such termination. In the event of
a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ , the Company
shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent (to an account designated in
writing by Parent) no later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such
termination.

(b) If the Company validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(c)(ii)_ as a result of an Intentional Breach by Parent or Purchaser or
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(iv)_, and at the time of such termination, all other
conditions set forth in _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ __ have been satisfied or waived at
the Expiration Time (except for (i) those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Offer Closing Date, but subject to such conditions
being able to be satisfied or (ii) those conditions that have not been
satisfied as a result of a breach of this Agreement by Parent), then Parent
shall pay to the Company a fee of $31,522,425 in cash (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ").

 

(c) If (i) Parent or the Company validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(_ _i_ _)_  or _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(iii)_, or
Parent validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.01(d)(ii)_, (ii) following the execution of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been
publicly disclosed or shall have otherwise become publicly known (and not
publicly withdrawn prior to the time of such termination), and (iii) within
twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company
consummates a Company Takeover Proposal or enters into a Company Acquisition
Agreement (in each case, whether or not the Company Takeover Proposal
referenced in _clause (iii)_ ) and such Company Takeover Proposal is
subsequently consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee on the date no later than two (2) Business Days after, and
subject to, the consummation of such Company Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) All payments under this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ shall be made by the
respective Party obligated to make such payment to the other Party by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
such other Party.

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Limited Guarantee and,
without such provisions, the Parties would not have entered into this
Agreement or the Limited Guarantee; accordingly, if any Party fails to
promptly pay or cause to be paid any amount due pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.03(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
the other Party commences a suit that results in a judgment against such
first Party for the amount set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ or _Section_
__ _ 8.03(b)_ or any portion thereof, such first Party shall pay or cause to
be paid to the other Party its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate published by
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made through the date of payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that:

(i) Subject in all respects to Parents right to injunction and
specific performance under _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, if this Agreement is
validly terminated under circumstances in which the Company is obligated to
pay the Company Termination Fee under _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ or  _Section_
__ _ 8.03(c)_, payment of the Company Termination Fee in accordance with this
Agreement and any reimbursement and expense obligations of the Company
pursuant to the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.03(e)_ ("
_Enforcement Expenses_ ") shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent,
Purchaser, and each of their respective

 



54

    

 Affiliates, as applicable, against the Company, its Affiliates, and each of
their respective former, current and future directors, officers, employees,
equityholders, controlling Persons, members, managers, general or limited
partners, assignees or other Affiliates or Representatives (collectively, the
" _Company Related Parties_ "), and upon payment of such Company Termination
Fee and any Enforcement Expenses, none of the Company Related Parties will
have any further liability or obligation to Parent, Purchaser or their
respective Affiliates for any Claim, loss, judgment, inquires, fines, fees,
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) or damage
based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution, termination, failure, performance (or nonperformance) or any actual
or purported breach hereof or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect
of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and Parent, Purchaser and each of their
respective Affiliates shall not have, and each expressly waives and
relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse (whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute)
or in equity).

(ii) Subject in all respects to the Companys right to injunction
and specific performance under _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, if this Agreement is
validly terminated under circumstances in which Parent is obligated to pay the
Parent Termination Fee under _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_, payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, any Enforcement Expenses and Parents indemnification and
reimbursement obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ (" _Reimbursement
Obligations_ ") shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its
Affiliates, as applicable, against Parent, Purchaser, the Sponsor and each of
their respective Affiliates, and each of their respective former, current and
future directors, officers, employees, equityholders, controlling Persons,
members, managers, financing sources, general or limited partners, assignees
or other Affiliates or Representatives (collectively, the " _Parent Related
Parties_ ") and the Lender and Lender Related Parties, and upon payment
of such Parent Termination Fee and any Enforcement Expenses or Reimbursement
Obligations, none of the Parent Related Parties, the Lender nor the Lender
Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to the Company
or its Affiliates for any Claim, loss, judgment, inquires, fines, fees, costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) or damage based
upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment
Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Debt Commitment Letter or the negotiation,
execution, termination, failure, performance (or nonperformance) or any actual
or purported breach hereof or thereof (including any breach by the Sponsor),
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including the Financing)
or in respect of any other documents or theory of law or equity or in respect
of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and the Company and its Affiliates shall not
have, and each expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or
recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law
(including at common law or by statute) or in equity); _provided_ , that
nothing in this Agreement will limit in any way the remedies of the parties
under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(iii) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company or
Parent, as applicable, be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the
Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one (1) occasion and the
payment of any amounts under this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ shall be subject in
all cases to the last sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 9.10(a)_. Except with
respect to _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_, no Party shall be entitled to specific
performance or other equitable relief under _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ if this
Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.01_; _provided_ , _however_ , and, for further clarity, in any circumstances
where performance by Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, of its obligations under this Agreement would relieve such
Party of its obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee or the Company
Termination Fee, respectively, the other Party may, in its sole discretion:
(A) seek specific performance pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.10_; (B) withdraw
any claim for specific performance and require payment of the Parent
Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, if entitled to
payment of such fee 

 



55

    

 under this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_; or (C) if the other Party is unable for
any reason to obtain specific performance, require payment of the Parent
Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, if entitled to
payment of such fee under this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_.

 

(iv) In no event shall (A) any Parent Related Party, Lender or Lender Related
Party have any liability for monetary damages to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any other Company Related Party (whether at law, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee, the Debt Commitment Letter or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Financing),
other than (1) Sponsors obligations under the Limited Guarantee and the
Equity Commitment Letter, (2) the obligations of Parent and Purchaser
as provided herein and (3) the obligations of Parent, Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates under the Confidentiality Agreement, or (B) any
Company Related Party have any liability for monetary damages to Sponsor,
Parent, Purchaser or any other Parent Related Party (whether at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the obligations of the
Company as provided herein.

 

(v) In no event shall the Company or any Company Related Party seek or obtain,
nor shall it permit any of its Representatives to seek or obtain, nor shall
any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any recovery, judgment or monetary
award of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect, or punitive
damages, against any Non-Recourse Parent Party (as defined in the Equity
Commitment Letter, which excludes, for the avoidance of doubt, Sponsor, Parent
and Purchaser), the Lender or any Lender Related Party, with respect to
any Claim, liability, loss, judgment, inquires, fines, fees, costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) or damage based upon,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter,
the Limited Guarantee, the Debt Commitment Letter or the negotiation,
execution, termination, failure, performance (or nonperformance) or any actual
or purported breach hereof or thereof (including any breach by the Sponsor),
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including the Financing)
or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect
of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, other than from (A) Parent or Purchaser to the
extent expressly provided for in this Agreement, (B) Sponsor to the extent
expressly provided for in the Limited Guarantee or the Equity Commitment
Letter or (C) Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to the
extent expressly provided for in the Confidentiality Agreement.

obtain, nor shall it permit any of its Representatives to seek or obtain, nor
shall any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any recovery, judgment or
monetary award of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect, or
punitive damages, against any Company Related Party (other than the Company)
with respect to any Claim, liability, loss, judgment, inquires, fines, fees,
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) or damage
based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution, termination, failure, performance (or nonperformance)
or any actual or purported breach hereof or thereof, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or
equity or in respect of any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

 

(f) Each Party acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that the payment of the Company Termination Fee or
Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, is not a penalty but instead is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that shall compensate Parent,
Purchaser and their respective Affiliates or the Company and its Affiliates,
as applicable, in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or
Parent Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and the Limited
Guarantee and in reliance on this Agreement and the Limited Guarantee and on
the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Limited Guarantee, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

Section 8.04 _Recoverable Damages_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 8.05(a)_,
Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that, without in any way limiting
the Companys rights under _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, recoverable damages of the
Company under this Agreement and the Limited Guarantee shall not be limited
to reimbursement of expenses or out of pocket costs but shall also include the
benefit of the bargain lost by the Company Stockholders (including "lost
premium"), taking into consideration relevant matters, including the total
amount payable to the Company Stockholders under this Agreement or the Limited
Guarantee and the time value of money, which, in each case, shall be deemed in
such event to be damages of the Company and shall be recoverable by the
Company on behalf of its stockholders.

Section 8.05 _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (and without
limiting the rights of the Lender or Lender Related Parties under  _Section_
__ _ 8.03_), in no event shall the Company Related Parties be entitled to

any Claim, liability, loss, judgment, inquiries, fines, fees, costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) or damage based upon,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment
Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Debt Commitment Letter or the negotiation,
execution, termination, failure, performance (or nonperformance) or any actual

nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any Party or such Party waives its rights
under this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ with respect thereto. Upon any determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.04 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts (including by electronic transmission, by facsimile or email

Agreement (except for paragraphs 4, 8, 9 and 10 of the Confidentiality
Agreement), the Commitment Letters and the Limited Guarantee constitute the
entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both

respect to the Offer and the Merger.

 

(b) Except: (i) subject in all respects to the limitations set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.03_ and  _Section_ __ _ 8.05_ for the right of the Company

expressly provided in this Agreement, including the last sentence of _Section_
__ _ 6.03(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.09_; (iii) after the Effective Time, for
_Section_ __ _ 3.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, each of which is intended to
be for

 



59

    

 the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Company
Stockholders as of immediately prior to Effective Time, which holders are
express third-party beneficiaries of  _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ and _Section_ __
_ 3.02_ from and after the Effective Time; and (iv) after the Effective Time,
for _Section_ __ _ 3.04_, which is intended to be for the benefit of,

beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _ 3.04_ from and after the Effective Time, each
Party agrees that (A) their respective representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the
other Parties, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement

Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies under this Agreement,

and obligations pursuant to this Agreement from and after the Effective Time
(a) in connection with a merger or consolidation involving Parent or Purchaser
or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent,
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation and (b) to any of their respective

successors and assigns.

Section 9.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including all matters of
construction, and all Claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute)
or in equity) that may be based on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement
or the negotiation, execution, performance, consummation or subject matter of
this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of
the Parties agrees that all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Lender or any of
the Lender Related Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including any claims or causes of
action relating to the Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of law thereof.

 

Section 9.08 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified and
supplemented in any and all respects any time prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any of the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (a) no such amendment, modification or supplement shall result in the
Merger Consideration not being the same amount and kind of cash, property,
rights or securities as the consideration being offered to holders of Company
Shares in the Offer, (b) after the Offer Closing, no such amendment,
modification or supplement shall adversely affect the rights of the Company
Stockholders (other than Parent, Purchaser or their respective Affiliates)
under this Agreement without the approval of such Company Stockholders and (c)
no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time. Any
such amendment, modification or supplement shall be effective only if it is
set forth in an instrument in writing executed by each Party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,  _Section_ __ _
8.03(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.05_ the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_,
the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.07_, this sentence, the last sentence
of  _Section_ __ _ 9.09_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.10(a)_, the
last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ (and any
other provision of 

 



60

    

 this Agreement to the extent that an amendment, supplement or other
modification of such provision would modify the substance of the foregoing
specified provisions) may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
in any manner that is adverse to the Lender or any Lender Related Party
without the prior written consent of the Lender.

 

Section 9.09 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, (c) subject to _clause_ __ _ (a)_ of _Section_
__ _ 9.08_, waive compliance with any covenants and agreements in this
Agreement or (d) waive the satisfaction of any of the conditions in
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Offer Conditions may be
waived only in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.01(c)_. Any agreement on the
part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed by the Party against whom the waiver
or extension is to be effective. The failure of any party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, _Section_ __ _ 8.03(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.05_
the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_, the last sentence of 
_Section_ __ _ 9.07_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.08_, the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.10(a)_, this sentence, the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 9.11_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ (and any other provision of
this Agreement to the extent that any waiver of such provision would modify
the substance of the foregoing specified provisions) may not be waived in any
manner that is adverse to the Lender or any Lender Related Party without the
prior written consent of the Lender.

Section 9.10  _Specific_ _Performance_.

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached or threatened
to be breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, at any time prior to
the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VIII_ and
subject in all respects to this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right of a Party to
cause each other Party to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in any court referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 9.11_, without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or any similar
instrument in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties
further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for
any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, while a Partys pursuit of
specific performance at any time shall not be deemed an election of remedies
or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such
party may be entitled, except with respect to _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_, under
no circumstances shall the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance or other equitable
relief, on the one hand, and the payment of any monetary damages, on the other
hand.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 9.10(a)_, it is expressly agreed that
the right of the Company to specific performance or other equitable remedies
in connection with enforcing Parents obligation to fund the Equity Financing
in order to consummate the Offer Closing and the Closing, including by
demanding Parent and/or Purchaser file one or more lawsuits against the
parties to the Equity Commitment Letter to fully enforce such parties
obligations thereunder and Parents and/or Purchasers rights thereunder,
shall be subject to the requirements that: (A) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in writing that (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __
_ 7.01_ and the conditions set forth in _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ have been
satisfied (and continue to be satisfied) or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are intended to be satisfied at the Offer
Closing, but subject to those conditions being capable of being satisfied at
the Offer Closing) at the time when the Offer Closing would

 



61

    

 have occurred (not taking into account any Financing Failure) or been
required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.01(a)_, (ii) if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing and Equity Financing were
funded in accordance with the terms thereof, the Offer Closing and the Closing
will occur and (iii) that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are
funded, then it is prepared, willing and able to effect the Offer Closing and
the Closing to occur pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (B) with respect
to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the Offer Closing, all of
the conditions set forth in  _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ shall have been satisfied or
waived as of the Expiration Time and (C) the Debt Financing has been funded or
will be funded in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter at
the Offer Closing (if the Equity Financing is funded in accordance with the
terms of the Equity Commitment Letter at the Offer Closing); _provided_ , that
in no case shall Parent or Purchaser be required to draw down the Equity
Commitment Letter or consummate the Offer and the Merger if the Debt
Financing (or any alternative financing) is not in fact funded at the Offer
Closing.

 Section 9.11 _Jurisdiction; Venue_. All Claims (whether based on contract,
tort or otherwise) arising from, under or in connection with or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the actions of
Parent, Purchaser or the Company in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement thereof shall be raised to and exclusively
determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent
such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, each such court to whose jurisdiction and venue the Parties
unconditionally consent and submit. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such Claim
in such court and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and
agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Claim brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party
further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by
U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.02_ shall be effective service of process for any Claim brought against
such Party in any such court. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising from,
under or in connection with or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or the actions of Parent, Purchaser or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in
Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of
the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any legal proceeding
against the Lender or any of the Lender Related Parties arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any dispute relating to the Financing, in any forum other than the
United States federal court located in, or if that court does not have
subject matter jurisdiction, in any New York state court located in, the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New  York, New York.

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) WHICH MAY ARISE FROM,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT COMMITMENT
LETTER OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, TERMINATION, FAILURE, PERFORMANCE (OR
NONPERFORMANCE) OR ANY ACTUAL OR PURPORTED BREACH HEREOF OR THEREOF OR THE

CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY

EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV)

all the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

such Disclosure Letter to the extent the applicability of such matter to such
other sections is reasonably apparent on its face. Any capitalized term used

Expiration Time that number of Company Shares (excluding Company Shares
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
"received" (as defined by Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL) by the depositary in
the Offer) that, when added to the Company Shares already owned by Parent,

except where the failure of any such representation or warranty to be true and

__ _ 4.03(a)_, _(b)_ and _(c)_ shall be true and correct in all respects at

and correct in all material respects as of immediately prior to the Expiration
Time as if made at and as of the Expiration Time (except to the extent any
such representation or warranty is expressly made as of an earlier date or
time, in which case as of such earlier date or time); and (iv) the
representations and warranties of the Company made in _Section_ __ _ 4.07(c)_
shall be true and correct in all respects;

covenants and agreements required to be performed or complied with by it
under this Agreement at or prior to the Expiration Time;

regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.
