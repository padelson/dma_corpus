of GCIC and GBDC;

  



  

B. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

(sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Company_ ").

  



  

C. Immediately after the Merger and the Terminations, the Surviving

with the Merger, the " _Mergers_ "), with GBDC as the surviving company in the
Second Merger.

  



  

D. The Board of Directors of GCIC (the " _GCIC Board_ "), including all
of the Independent Directors of GCIC, has unanimously (i) determined that (x)
this Agreement and the terms of the Mergers and the related Transactions are

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,

as follows:

  



  

Article I 
  
 THE MERGER

  



  

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "
_MGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into
GCIC, and the separate corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease.
GCIC shall be the surviving company in the Merger and shall continue its
existence as a corporation under the Laws of the State of Maryland.

  



  

1.2 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of Dechert LLP, Three Bryant
Park, 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036, on the date that is
five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver of the latest to occur
of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), unless otherwise agreed in writing
by the parties to this Agreement (the " _Closing Date_ ").

  



  

1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth
in the articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") that shall be filed
with, and accepted for record by, the State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of Maryland (the " _SDAT_ ") on the Closing Date. The term "
_Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger.

  



  

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the MGCL.

  



  

1.5 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of GCIC, GBDC or Merger Sub or
the holder of any of the following securities:

  



  

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Company.

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) All shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of GCIC
(the " _GCIC Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are owned by GBDC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of GBDC (the " _GBDC
Common Stock_ ") or any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor (such shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 1.5(e)_ , each share of GCIC Common Stock,
except for the Cancelled Shares, shall be converted, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Article II_ , into the right to receive a number of
shares of GBDC Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

  



  

(d) All of the shares of GCIC Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_  shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and each such share of GCIC Common Stock, all
of which are in non-certificated book-entry form, shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which such shares of GCIC Common Stock represented in
non-certificated book-entry form have been converted pursuant to _Section
2.2_ and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section
2.4(b)_.

  



  

(e) The Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted (to the extent
not already taken into account in determining the Closing GCIC Net Asset
Value and/or the Closing GBDC Net Asset Value, as applicable) if, between the
Determination Date and the Effective Time, the respective outstanding shares
of GBDC Common Stock or GCIC Common Stock shall have been increased or
decreased or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of
shares or securities, in each case, as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, combination or
exchange of shares, or if a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other
securities shall be authorized and declared with a record date within such
period. Nothing in this _Section 1.5(e)_  shall be construed to permit any
party hereto to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by
any other provision of this Agreement.

  



  

1.6 _Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving Company_. The charter of
Merger Sub and the bylaws of Merger Sub, in each case as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the charter and the bylaws
of the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time, until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable Law and the respective terms of such charter and
bylaws, as applicable.

  



  

1.7 _Directors and Officers_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors
and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors and officers of the Surviving Company and shall hold office
until the next annual meeting of the Surviving Company and until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualify, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal. The directors and officers of GBDC immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of GBDC immediately
after consummation of the Second Merger and shall hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualify, or their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

  



    

 | 3|

1.8 _Effect on GBDC Common Stock_. Each share of GBDC Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding.

  



  

1.9 _Termination of Certain Contractual Obligations._ Immediately
after the Effective Time and immediately prior to the Second Merger, the
GCIC Advisory Agreement, the GCIC Administration Agreement and the GCIC
Trademark License Agreement shall be automatically terminated and of no
further force and effect (the ' _Terminations_ ").

  



  

1.10 _Merger of Surviving Company._ Immediately after the occurrence
of the Effective Time and the Terminations and in accordance with
the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ ") and the MGCL, the Surviving
Company shall merge with and into GBDC and the separate corporate existence
of the Surviving Company shall cease and all outstanding shares of common
stock of the Surviving Company shall be cancelled and no consideration shall
be exchanged therefor. GBDC shall be the surviving company in the
Second Merger and shall continue its existence as a corporation under the
Laws of the State of Delaware.

  



  

Article II 
  
 MERGER CONSIDERATION

  



  

2.1 _Delivery of Evidence of GBDC Common Stock_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, GBDC shall deposit with its
transfer agent evidence of book-entry shares representing GBDC Common Stock
issuable as Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)_.

  



  

2.2 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of GBDC Common Stock
shall be issued upon the conversion of GCIC Common Stock pursuant to _Section
1.5(c)_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of GBDC Common Stock. Each
holder of shares of GCIC Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of GBDC
Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of GBDC
Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume-weighted average trading price of a
share of GBDC Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the " _Nasdaq_
") for the five (5) consecutive Trading Days ending on the third (3rd)
Trading Day preceding the Closing Date (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or its
successor or, if not reported thereon, another authoritative source selected
by GBDC that is reasonably acceptable to GCIC). For purposes of this
_Section 2.2_ , all fractional shares to which a single record holder would
be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three
decimal places.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.3 _Paying and Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, GBDC
shall appoint GBDC's transfer agent or other bank or trust company to act as
exchange agent (the " _Paying and Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder, pursuant to an
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to each of GBDC and GCIC. Following
the Effective Time, GBDC shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Paying and Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate cash for
fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_. Any cash deposited with
the Paying and Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

  



  

2.4 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Each holder of record of shares of GCIC Common Stock (other than
the Cancelled Shares) in book-entry form that were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)_ and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of GBDC Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.4(b)_ , shall, promptly after the Effective Time, be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
GBDC Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.4(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose
other than the purposes provided for in the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(b) Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws, following the Effective Time, the record holder of
shares (other than Cancelled Shares) of GCIC Common Stock at the Effective
Time shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of GBDC Common Stock
represented by such shares of GCIC Common Stock and not paid and/or (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to the whole shares of GBDC Common Stock represented by
such shares of GCIC Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
(but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the
issuance of GBDC Common Stock issuable with respect to such shares of GCIC
Common Stock.

  



  

2.5 _No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid by
GBDC in accordance with the terms of _Article I_ and _Article II_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to GCIC
Common Stock in respect of which such Merger Consideration was paid. From and
after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of GCIC shall be closed,
and there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of GCIC
of the shares of GCIC Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.6 _Net Asset Value Calculation._

  



  

(a) GCIC shall deliver to GBDC a calculation of the net asset value per
share of GCIC Common Stock as of a date mutually agreed between GBDC and
GCIC, such date to be no earlier than 48 hours (excluding Sundays and
holidays) prior to the Closing Date (such agreed date, the " _Determination
Date_ "), calculated in good faith as of such date and based on the same
assumptions and methodologies, and applying the same categories of
adjustments to net asset value (except as may be mutually agreed by
the parties), historically used by GCIC in preparing the calculation of the

calculation of the net asset value per share of GBDC Common Stock (the "
_Closing GBDC Net Asset Value_ "); _provided_ that GBDC shall update the
calculation of the Closing GBDC Net Asset Value in the event there is a

(d) GC Advisors agrees to give each of GBDC and GCIC and its respective

Stock shall thereafter look only to GBDC with respect to such cash in lieu of
fractional shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of GBDC, GCIC, the Surviving Company, Merger Sub, the Paying
and Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder
of shares of GCIC Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar

any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the recipient.

GCIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

(e) No "affiliated person" (as defined under the Investment Company
Act) of GCIC has been subject to disqualification to serve in any capacity
contemplated by the Investment Company Act for any investment company
(including a BDC) under Sections 9(a) and 9(b) of the Investment Company Act,

pending and served or, to the knowledge of GCIC, threatened that would result
in any such disqualification.

  



  

(f) The minute books and other similar records of GCIC contain a true

3.10 _GCIC Information_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by GCIC for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement is filed
with the SEC, at any time the Registration Statement is amended or
supplemented or at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under
the Securities Act, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the
date the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement is
first mailed to stockholders of GCIC or stockholders of GBDC or at the time
of the GCIC Stockholders Meeting or the GBDC Stockholders Meeting, in each
case, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation or warranty is made by GCIC with respect to information
supplied by GBDC, Merger Sub or GC Advisors for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

  



  

3.11 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a) GCIC and each of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has duly and timely
filed (taking into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax
Returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement
(all such Tax Returns being accurate and complete in all material respects),
has paid all material Taxes shown thereon as arising and has duly paid or made
provision for the payment of all material Taxes that have been incurred or
are due or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local
taxing authorities other than Taxes that are not yet delinquent or are being
contested in good faith, have not been finally determined and have been
adequately reserved against under GAAP. No material Tax Return of GCIC or any
Consolidated Subsidiary has been examined by the Internal Revenue Service
(the " _IRS_ ") or other relevant taxing authority. There are no material
disputes pending, or written claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon
GCIC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries for which GCIC does not have
reserves that are adequate under GAAP. Neither GCIC nor any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing,
allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an
agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among GCIC and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries). Within the past five years (or otherwise as part
of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part), neither GCIC nor any
of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock which qualified or was
intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code and to which Section
355 of the Code (or so much of Section 356 of the Code, as it relates to
Section 355 of the Code) applied or was intended to apply. Neither GCIC nor
any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is required to include in income any
adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code, no such adjustment has
been proposed by the IRS and no pending request for permission to change any
accounting method has been submitted by GCIC or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries. Neither GCIC nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has
participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). If GCIC or any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable transaction"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b), such entity
has properly disclosed such transaction in accordance with the applicable Tax
regulations.

  



    

 | 16| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) GCIC made a valid election under Part I of Subchapter M of Subtitle
A, Chapter 1, of the Code to be taxed as a "regulated investment company" (a
" _RIC_ "). GCIC has qualified as a RIC at all times since the beginning of
its taxable year ending September 30, 2015 and expects to continue to so
qualify through the Effective Time. No challenge to GCIC's status as a RIC is
pending or has been threatened orally or in writing. For each taxable year of
GCIC ending on or before the Effective Time, GCIC has satisfied the
distribution requirements imposed on a regulated investment company under
Section 852 of the Code (assuming for these purposes that any Tax Dividend
declared by GCIC after the date of this Agreement has been timely paid).

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, GCIC shall have declared and paid a
Tax Dividend with respect to all taxable years ended prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Determination Date, GCIC shall have declared a
Tax Dividend with respect to the final taxable year ending with its complete
liquidation.

  



  

(d) GCIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes and have, within the time and in the manner prescribed
by applicable Law, in all material respects, withheld from and paid over all
amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable Laws.

  



  

(e) GCIC is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably
be expected to prevent the Mergers from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

(f) GCIC has no "earnings and profits" for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes described in Section 852(a)(2)(B) of the Code.

  



  

(g) Section 3.11(g) of the GCIC Disclosure Schedule lists each asset
the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of
the Code as prescribed in IRS Notice 88-19, 1988-1 C.B. 486, or Treasury
Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7 and the amount of "net unrealized built-in
gain" (within the meaning of Section 1374(d) of the Code) on each such asset.
Other than such assets listed in Section 3.11(g) of the GCIC Disclosure
Schedule, GCIC is not now and will not be subject to corporate-level
income taxation on the sale, transfer or other disposition of its assets
currently held as a result of the application of Section 337(d) of the Code
or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(h) No claim has been made in writing by a taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where GCIC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries does not file
Tax Returns that GCIC or any such Consolidated Subsidiary is or may be subject
to taxation by that jurisdiction, and which, if upheld, would reasonably
result in a material Tax liability.

  



  

(i) Neither GCIC nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has, or has
ever had, a permanent establishment in any country other than the
United States.

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(j) Neither GCIC nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has requested
a private letter ruling from the IRS or comparable rulings from other taxing
authorities.

  



  

(k) Neither GCIC nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has any
liability for the Taxes of another Person other than GCIC and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee, successor
or payable pursuant to a contractual obligation.

  



  

(l) Neither GCIC nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has ever been
a member of a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax group (other than such a
group the common parent of which is GCIC or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries).

  



  

(m) There are no material Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due
and payable) upon any of the assets of GCIC or any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries.

  



  

3.12 _Litigation_. There are no material Proceedings pending or, to
GCIC's knowledge, threatened against GCIC or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries. There is no Order binding upon GCIC or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries other than such Orders as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to GCIC and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

3.13 _Employee Matters_. Neither GCIC nor any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries has (i) any employees or (ii) any "employee benefit plans" as
defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended, or any employment, bonus, incentive, vacation, stock option
or other equity based, severance, termination, retention, change of control,
profit sharing, fringe benefit, health, medical or other similar plan,
program or agreement (collectively, " _Employee Benefit Plans_ ").

  



  

3.14 _Certain Contracts_.

  



  

(a) GCIC has Previously Disclosed a complete and accurate list of, and
true and complete copies have been delivered or made available (including via
EDGAR) to GBDC of, all Contracts (collectively, the " _GCIC Material

Consolidated Subsidiaries is a party, or by which GCIC or any of its

of its Consolidated Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness in an aggregate principal
amount in excess of $500,000;

  



    

 | 18| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) any Contract that creates future payment obligations in excess of
$250,000 and that by its terms does not terminate, or is not terminable upon
notice, without penalty within 90 days or less, or any Contract that creates
or would create a Lien on any asset of GCIC or its Consolidated Subsidiaries
(other than Liens consisting of restrictions on transfer agreed to in respect
of investments entered into in the ordinary course of business or as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to GCIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole);

  



  

(iv) except with respect to investments set forth in the GCIC SEC
Reports, any partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or
other similar Contract that is not entered into in the ordinary course of
business and is material to GCIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole;

  



  

(v) any non-competition or non-solicitation Contract or any other
Contract that limits, purports to limit, or would reasonably be expected to
limit in each case in any material respect the manner in which, or the
localities in which, any material business of GCIC and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is or could be conducted or the types of
business that GCIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries conducts or may conduct;

  



  

(vi) any Contract relating to the acquisition or disposition of any
business or operations (whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or
otherwise) involving value in excess of $250,000 (individually or together
with all related Contracts) as to which there are any ongoing obligations or

set forth in the GCIC SEC Reports;

  



  

(vii) any Contract that obligates GCIC or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries to conduct any business that is material to GCIC and its

third party, or upon consummation of the Merger, will obligate GBDC, the
Surviving Company or any of their Consolidated Subsidiaries to conduct
business with any third-party on an exclusive basis; or

  



  

(viii) any Contract with a Governmental Entity.

  



    

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each GCIC Material Contract is (x) valid and binding on GCIC or its
applicable Consolidated Subsidiary and, to GCIC's knowledge, each other party
thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), and (z) is in full force and effect other
than in each case as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to GCIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. The GCIC Advisory Agreement has been approved by the GCIC Board
and stockholders of GCIC in accordance with Section 15 of the Investment
Company Act. Neither GCIC nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries nor, to
GCIC's knowledge, any other party thereto, is in material breach of any
provisions of or in default (or, with the giving of notice or lapse of time
or both, would be in default) under, and has not taken any action resulting
in the termination of, acceleration of performance required by, or resulting
in a right of termination or acceleration under, any GCIC Material Contract
other than as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to GCIC. No GCIC
Material Contract has been amended, modified or supplemented other than as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to GCIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No
event has occurred with respect to GCIC or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries that, with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or
both, would constitute a breach or default under any GCIC Material Contract
other than as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to GCIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

computer programs and other proprietary intellectual property rights
(collectively, " _Intellectual Property Rights_ ") that are material to the
conduct of the business of GCIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a
whole (hereinafter, " _GCIC Intellectual Property Rights_ "), except where
the failure to own, possess or have adequate rights would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to GCIC. No claims are pending for which GCIC has received
written notice or, to the knowledge of GCIC, threatened (i) that GCIC or any
of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is infringing or otherwise violating the
rights of any Person with regard to any Intellectual Property Right, or (ii)
that any GCIC Intellectual Property Right is invalid or unenforceable. To the
knowledge of GCIC, no Person is infringing, misappropriating or using without
authorization the rights of GCIC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries with
respect to any Intellectual Property Right, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to GCIC and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

such Permit that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to GBDC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. All such Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be

not received any written or, to GBDC's knowledge, oral notification from a
Governmental Entity of any material non-compliance with any such Permits,

adequately reserved against under GAAP. No material Tax Return of GBDC or any

Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part), neither GBDC
nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has been a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock which

properly disclosed such transaction in accordance with the applicable Tax
regulations.

and expects to continue to so qualify through the Effective Time. No
challenge to GBDC's status as a RIC is pending or has been threatened orally

Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7 and the amount of "net unrealized built-in
gain" (within the meaning of Section 1374(d) of the Code) on each such asset.
Other than such assets listed in Section 4.11(g) of the GBDC Disclosure
Schedule, GBDC is not now and will not be subject to corporate-level
income taxation on the sale, transfer or other disposition of its assets

(h) No claim has been made in writing by a taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where GBDC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries does not file

Contract has been amended, modified or supplemented other than as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to
GBDC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No event has
occurred with respect to GBDC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries that,

each GBDC Insurance Policy have been paid. Neither GBDC nor any of its

Intellectual Property Rights that are material to the conduct of the business
of GBDC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole (hereinafter, "
_GBDC Intellectual Property Rights_ "), except where the failure to own,
possess or have adequate rights would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to GCIC.
No claims are pending for which GBDC has received written notice or, to the
knowledge of GBDC, threatened (i) that GBDC or any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries is infringing or otherwise violating the rights of
any Person with regard to any Intellectual Property Right, or (ii) that any
GBDC Intellectual Property Right is invalid or unenforceable. To the knowledge
of GBDC, no Person is infringing, misappropriating or using without

4.19 _Investment Assets_. Each of GBDC and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries has good title to all securities, Indebtedness and other
financial instruments owned by it, free and clear of any material Liens,
except to the extent such securities, Indebtedness or other financial
instruments, as applicable, are pledged to secure obligations of GBDC or its
Consolidated Subsidiaries set forth in Section 4.19 of the GBDC Disclosure
Schedule and except for Liens consisting of restrictions on transfer agreed to
in respect of investments entered into in the ordinary course of business. As

mutually agreed by the parties, all valuations made by third-party valuation
agents for such purposes will be made only by valuation agents that have been
approved by the GBDC Board as of September 30, 2018. Except as may be
mutually agreed by the parties, the fair value of any portfolio securities for
which fair value determinations were made by the GBDC Board for purposes of
such computations were or will be determined by the GBDC Board in good faith
in accordance with the valuation methods set forth in GBDC's valuation
policies and procedures adopted by the GBDC Board as of September 30, 2018.

liability company power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets

case, other than as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to GC Advisors.

  



  

5.2 _Authority; No Violation._

authority to execute and deliver this Agreement. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement has been duly and validly approved by the managers of GC
Advisors. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by

GBDC and Merger Sub) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of GC
Advisors, enforceable against GC Advisors in accordance with its
terms (except as may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception).

Advisors, nor the consummation of the Transactions, nor performance of

(c) No consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with, any
Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with the execution, delivery

5.3 _Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits_.

  



  

(a) GC Advisors is, and at all times required by the Investment
Advisers Act when GC Advisors has been the investment adviser to GBDC or GCIC

(other than the Investment Advisers Act) when GC Advisors has been the
investment adviser to GBDC or GCIC has been, duly registered, licensed or
qualified as an investment adviser in each state or any other jurisdiction
where the conduct of its business requires such registration, licensing or

Permit that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to GC Advisors. All such Permits are valid and in
full force and effect, except as would not, individually or in the

the period prior to the date of this Agreement that GC Advisors has been the
investment adviser to GBDC or GCIC, GC Advisors has been in compliance with
such policies and procedures, except where the failures to adopt such
policies and procedures or to be in compliance would not, individually or in

Advisors' knowledge, threatened against GC Advisors. There is no
Order binding upon GC Advisors other than such Orders as would not,

and procedures approved by the GCIC Board as of September 30, 2018 and set

valuation policies and procedures have been or will be permitted in valuing
such assets in connection with the computations pursuant to _Section 2.6_ for
purposes of this Agreement, and the value of all assets owned by GCIC other

of each investment asset owned by GBDC that is used in connection with the
computations made by GC Advisors on behalf of GBDC pursuant to _Section 2.6_
 will be determined in accordance with the valuation policies and procedures
approved by the GBDC Board as of September 30, 2018 and set forth in GBDC's
compliance policies and procedures and no exceptions to such valuation
policies and procedures have been or will be permitted in valuing such assets
in connection with the computations pursuant to _Section 2.6_ for purposes of
this Agreement, and the value of all assets owned by GBDC other than

GC Advisors on behalf of GBDC pursuant to Section 2.6 will be determined in
accordance with GAAP. Except as may be mutually agreed by the parties, all
valuations made by third-party valuation agents for such purposes will be made
only by valuation agents that have been approved by the GBDC Board as of
September 30, 2018. The Closing GCIC Net Asset Value presented by GC Advisors
to the GCIC Board will reflect GC Advisors' assessment of the fair value of
any portfolio securities of GCIC for which market quotations are not readily
available. The Closing GBDC Net Asset Value presented by GC Advisors to the
GBDC Board will reflect GC Advisors' assessment of the fair value of any
portfolio securities of GBDC for which market quotations are not readily
available. No systematic differences exist with respect to the underlying
methodologies and conventions used by GCIC, GBDC and the third-party
valuation agents to value the assets of GCIC and GBDC, respectively.

(a) Subject to the right of GCIC to take any action that constitutes a
GCIC Adverse Recommendation Change as expressly permitted pursuant to 
_Section 7.7_ , and the right of GBDC to take any action that constitutes a
GBDC Adverse Recommendation Change as expressly permitted pursuant to
_Section 7.8_ , the parties shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and

such third parties and Governmental Entities.

  



  

In furtherance (but not in limitation) of the foregoing, each of GBDC and
GCIC shall as promptly as practicable file any required applications, notices

GCIC or GBDC, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Consolidated Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third-party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties
shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all Permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Permits of
all Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
Transactions and each party will keep the other reasonably apprised of the

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall require either GBDC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries or

consideration for the repayment, restructuring or amendment of terms of
indebtedness in connection with the Merger, other than any consent fees set
forth in _Section 3.3(b)_ of the GCIC Disclosure Schedule and _Section
4.3(b)_ of the GBDC Disclosure Schedule.

(a) GBDC and GCIC shall as promptly as practicable jointly prepare and

preparation of the Registration Statement and shall furnish to the other all
information reasonably requested as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
in connection with the Registration Statement or any other filing or
application made by or on behalf of GBDC, GCIC or any of their respective
Consolidated Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Mergers and the other Transactions. Prior to the Effective Time, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other party (i) upon becoming aware of any
event or circumstance that is required to be described in an amendment to the

(c) Subject to applicable Law, each of GBDC and GCIC shall promptly
advise the other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Entity, the consent or approval of which is required for
consummation of the Transactions, that causes such party to believe

be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially
delayed or conditioned.

  



  

7.3 _Stockholder Approval_.

  



  

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the GCIC Board has adopted
resolutions approving the GCIC Matters, including the Merger, on the terms

shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain from GCIC's stockholders the vote
required to approve the GCIC Matters, on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, including, subject to _Section 7.7_ , by providing to
GCIC's stockholders the GCIC Board's recommendation of the GCIC Matters and
including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and by,
at the request of GBDC, postponing or adjourning the GCIC Stockholders Meeting
to obtain a quorum or solicit additional proxies; _provided_ that GCIC shall
not postpone or adjourn the GCIC Stockholders Meeting for any other reason
without the prior written consent of GBDC (which prior written consent shall
not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, GCIC's obligations pursuant to this _Section
7.3(a)_ (including its obligation to submit to its stockholders the GCIC
Matters and any other matters required to be approved or adopted by its
stockholders in order to carry out the Transactions) shall not be affected by
(i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
GCIC, its Representatives or its stockholders of any Takeover Proposal
(including any GCIC Superior Proposal), (ii) GCIC effecting a Takeover
Approval or delivering a Notice of a GCIC Superior Proposal or (iii) a GCIC

_Section 7.8_ , GBDC shall submit to its stockholders the GBDC Matters on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and any other
matters required to be approved or adopted by its stockholders in order to
carry out the Transactions. In furtherance of that obligation, GBDC shall
take, in accordance with applicable Law and the GBDC Charter and the GBDC
Bylaws, all actions necessary to send a notice as promptly as practicable
(but in no event later than 10 Business Days) following the date on which the

Meeting, as promptly as practicable thereafter, to consider and vote upon
approval of the GBDC Matters including the issuance of shares of GBDC Common
Stock as Merger Consideration, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement as well as any other such matters. The record date for the GBDC
Stockholders Meeting shall be determined in prior consultation with and
subject to the prior written approval of GCIC (which prior written approval
shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld). GBDC shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain from GBDC's stockholders the GBDC Requisite
Vote to approve the GBDC Matters, on terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, including, subject to _Section 7.8_ , providing to GBDC's
stockholders the GBDC Board's recommendation of the approval of the GBDC
Matters and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and by, at the request of GCIC, postponing or adjourning
the GBDC Stockholders Meeting to obtain a quorum or solicit
additional proxies; _provided_ that GBDC shall not postpone or adjourn the
GBDC Stockholders Meeting for any other reason without the prior written
consent of GCIC (which prior written consent shall not be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, GBDC's obligations pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)_ (including its
obligation to submit to its stockholders the GBDC Matters and any other
matters required to be approved or adopted by its stockholders in order to
carry out the Transactions) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to GBDC, its
Representatives or its stockholders of any Takeover Proposal (including any
GBDC Superior Proposal), (ii) GBDC effecting a Takeover Approval or
delivering a Notice of a GBDC Superior Proposal or (iii) a GBDC Adverse

7.5 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Following the Effective Time, GBDC shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, defend and hold harmless and advance
expenses to the present and former directors and officers of GCIC or any of
its Consolidated Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against all costs or expenses (including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys' fees actually incurred, reasonable experts' fees,
reasonable travel expenses, court costs, transcript fees and
telecommunications, postage and courier charges), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, penalties, amounts paid in settlement or other liabilities
(collectively, " _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") incurred in connection with any
Proceeding arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the Transactions). In the event of any such
Indemnified Liabilities, (i) GBDC shall advance to such Indemnified Party,
upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably and actually
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law provided that
the Person to whom expenses are advanced, or someone on his or her behalf,
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification and complies with
other applicable provisions imposed under the Investment Company Act and
interpretations thereof by the SEC or its staff and (ii) GBDC and the
applicable Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of such matter.

  



  

(b) Unless GBDC and GCIC shall otherwise agree, prior to the Effective
Time, GCIC shall, and, if GCIC is unable to, GBDC shall, cause the Surviving
Company or its successor, effective as of the Effective Time, to obtain and
fully pay the premium for a "tail" insurance policy for the extension of the
directors' and officers' liability coverage of GCIC's existing directors' and
officers' insurance policies for a claims reporting or discovery period of six
years from and after the Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") with coverage
and amounts not less than, and terms and conditions that are not
materially less advantageous to the insureds as, GCIC's existing policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Current D andO Insurance_"). If GCIC and the Surviving Company or
its successor for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policy as
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or its successor shall, and GBDC
shall cause the Surviving Company or its successor to, continue to maintain in
effect for the Tail Period the Current DandO Insurance in place as of the date
of this Agreement with coverage and amounts not less than, and terms and
conditions that are not materially less advantageous to the insureds as,
provided in the Current DandO Insurance, or the Surviving Company or its
successor shall, and GBDC shall cause the Surviving Company or its successor
to, purchase comparable insurance for the Tail Period; _provided_ , that in
no event shall the annual cost of such insurance exceed during the Tail Period
300% of the current aggregate annual premium paid by GCIC for such purpose;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such insurance coverage exceeds
such amount, the Surviving Company or its successor shall obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
_Section 7.5(a)_, upon learning of any Proceeding described above, shall
promptly notify GBDC in writing; _provided_ , that the failure to so notify
shall not affect the obligations of GBDC under _Section 7.5(a)_ unless GBDC
is materially prejudiced as a consequence.

  



    

 | 50| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) If GBDC or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its
assets to any other entity, then and in each such case, GBDC shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of GBDC shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.5_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or
her heirs and representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by Contract or otherwise.

  



  

7.6 _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) Each of GCIC and GBDC shall, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates, Consolidated Subsidiaries, and its and each of their
respective officers, directors, trustees, managers, employees, consultants,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors, representatives and agents (collectively, " _Representatives_ ")
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to, or that are
intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal,
and demand the immediate return or destruction (which destruction shall be
certified in writing to GCIC or GBDC, as applicable) of all confidential
information previously furnished to any Person (other than GCIC, GBDC or
their respective Affiliates or Representatives) with respect to any Takeover
Proposal. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to _Section 7.7_ in the case
of GCIC and _Section 7.8_ in the case of GBDC, each of GCIC and GBDC shall
not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates, Consolidated Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives not to: (i) directly or indirectly
solicit, initiate, induce, encourage or take any other action (including by
providing information) designed to, or which could reasonably be expected to,
facilitate any inquiries or the making or submission or implementation of any
proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to its stockholders) with
respect to any Takeover Proposal; (ii) approve, publicly endorse or recommend
or enter into any agreement, arrangement, discussions or understandings with
respect to any Takeover Proposal (including any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, memorandum of understanding or confidentiality agreement) or
enter into any Contract or understanding (including any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding or confidentiality
agreement) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate, or that
is intended to or that could reasonably be expected to result in the
abandonment of, termination of or failure to consummate, the Merger or any
other Transaction; (iii) initiate or participate in any way in any
negotiations or discussions regarding, or furnish or disclose to any Person
(other than GBDC, GCIC or their respective Affiliates or Representatives) any
information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate or in
furtherance of any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal;
(iv) publicly propose or publicly announce an intention to take any of the
foregoing actions; or (v) grant any (x) approval pursuant to any Takeover
Statute to any Person (other than GBDC, GCIC or their respective Affiliates)
or with respect to any transaction (other than the Transactions) or (y)
waiver or release under any standstill or any similar agreement with respect
to equity securities of GCIC or GBDC.

  



    

 | 51| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each of GCIC and GBDC shall as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) (i) notify the
other party in writing of any request for information or any Takeover Proposal
and the terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry
(including the identity of the Person (or group of Persons) making such
request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry) and (ii) provide to the other party
copies of any written materials received by GCIC or GBDC or their
respective Representatives in connection with any of the foregoing, and the
identity of the Person (or group of Persons) making any such
request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry or with whom any discussions or
negotiations are taking place. Each of GCIC and GBDC agrees that it shall
keep the other party informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and
the material terms and conditions (including amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry and keep the
other party informed on a reasonably current basis of any information
requested of or provided by GCIC or GBDC and as to the status of all
discussions or negotiations with respect to any such request, Takeover
Proposal or inquiry.

  



  

7.7 _GCIC Takeover Proposals_.

  



  

(a) If on or after the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to
the GCIC Stockholders Meeting: (i) GCIC receives a bona fide
unsolicited Takeover Proposal (under circumstances in which GCIC has complied
in all material respects with the provisions of _Sections 7.6(a)_  and _(b)_
); (ii) the GCIC Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors of
GCIC, shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that (x) failure to consider such Takeover Proposal
would be reasonably likely to be a breach of the standard of conduct
applicable to the directors of GCIC under applicable Law and (y) such
Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a GCIC
Superior Proposal; and (iii) GCIC gives GBDC at least two (2) Business Days
prior written notice of the identity of the Person making such Takeover
Proposal, the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and GCIC's
intention to furnish information to, or participate in discussions or
negotiations with, the Person making such Takeover Proposal then, subject to
compliance with this _Section 7.7(a)_ , GCIC may:

  



  

(i) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Person who has made
the unsolicited bona fide Takeover Proposal and provide information in
response to a request therefor by a Person who has made such Takeover Proposal
if GCIC (A) receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement
with customary terms (including a standstill) and (B) provides GBDC a copy of
all such information that has not previously been delivered to GBDC
simultaneously with delivery to such Person (or such Person's
Representatives and Affiliates); and

  



  

(ii) after fulfilling its obligations under _Section 7.7(b)_ below,
adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or
recommend such Takeover Proposal, including entering into an agreement with
respect thereto (collectively, a " _Takeover Approval_ ").

  



    

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

If on or after the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to the GCIC
Stockholders Meeting, the GCIC Board, including a majority of the Independent
Directors of GCIC, shall have determined, by a majority of its members, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that continued recommendation of
the GCIC Matters to GCIC's stockholders would be reasonably likely to be a
breach of the standard of conduct applicable to the directors of GCIC under
applicable Law as a result of a GCIC Superior Proposal, GCIC may (A) withdraw
or qualify (or modify or amend in a manner adverse to GBDC), or publicly
propose to withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in a manner adverse to
GBDC), the approval, adoption, recommendation or declaration of advisability
by the GCIC Board of the GCIC Matters, including the recommendation of the
GCIC Board that the stockholders of GCIC approve the Merger (the " _GCIC
Recommendation_ "), and (B) take any action or make any statement, filing or
release, in connection with the GCIC Stockholders Meeting or otherwise,
inconsistent with the GCIC Recommendation (any action described in clause (A)
and (B) referred to collectively with any Takeover Approval as a " _GCIC
Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

  



  

(b) Upon any determination that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a GCIC
Superior Proposal, GCIC shall promptly provide (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours of such determination) to GBDC a written notice (a "
_Notice of a GCIC Superior Proposal_ ") (i) advising GBDC that the GCIC Board
has received a GCIC Superior Proposal, (ii) specifying in reasonable detail
the material terms and conditions of such GCIC Superior Proposal, including
the amount per share or other consideration that the stockholders of GCIC
will receive in connection with the Superior Proposal and including a copy of
all written materials provided to or by GCIC in connection with such GCIC
Superior Proposal (unless previously provided to GBDC) and (iii) identifying
the Person making such GCIC Superior Proposal. GCIC shall cooperate and
negotiate in good faith with GBDC (to the extent GBDC desires to negotiate)
during the five (5) calendar day period following GBDC's receipt of the
Notice of a GCIC Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such GCIC Superior Proposal
shall require a new notice and a new two (2) calendar day period) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
GCIC to determine that such GCIC Superior Proposal is no longer a GCIC
Superior Proposal and proceed with a GCIC Recommendation without a GCIC
Adverse Recommendation Change. If thereafter the GCIC Board determines, in its
reasonable good faith judgment, by a majority of its members, including a
majority of the Independent Directors of GCIC, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and after giving effect to any proposed adjustments to
the terms of this Agreement that such GCIC Superior Proposal remains a
GCIC Superior Proposal or the failure to make such GCIC Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be a breach of
the standard of conduct applicable to the directors of GCIC under applicable
Law, and GCIC has complied in all material respects with  _Section 7.7(a)_
above, GCIC may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(iv)_.

  



  

(c) Other than as permitted by _Section 7.7(a)_ , neither GCIC nor the
GCIC Board shall make any GCIC Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no GCIC Adverse Recommendation Change shall
change the approval of the GCIC Matters or any other approval of the GCIC
Board, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing any
Takeover Statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the
Transactions.

  



    

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) GCIC shall provide GBDC with prompt written notice of any meeting
of the GCIC Board at which the GCIC Board is reasonably expected to consider
any Takeover Proposal (such written notice shall in any event be received by
GBDC reasonably in advance of such meeting).

  



  

(e) Other than in connection with a GCIC Takeover Proposal, nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the GCIC Board from taking any
action described in clause (A) of the definition of GCIC Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event (a " _GCIC
Intervening Event Recommendation Change_ ") if (A) prior to effecting any such
GCIC Intervening Event Recommendation Change, GCIC promptly notifies GBDC, in
writing, at least five (5) Business Days (the " _GCIC Intervening Event
Notice Period_ ") before taking such action of its intent to consider such
action (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a GCIC Adverse
Recommendation Change or a GCIC Intervening Event Recommendation Change), and
which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of the
underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for taking, such action, (B)
GCIC shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the GCIC
Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate with GBDC in good faith (to the
extent GBDC desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that would not permit the GCIC Board to make a
GCIC Intervening Event Recommendation Change, and (C) the GCIC Board,
including a majority of the Independent Directors of GCIC, (or a committee
including a majority of the Independent Directors of GCIC thereof) determines,
after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
the failure to effect such a GCIC Intervening Event Recommendation Change, as
applicable, after taking into account any adjustments made by GBDC during the
GCIC Intervening Event Notice Period, would be reasonably likely to be a
breach of the standard of conduct applicable to the directors of GCIC under
applicable Law.

  



  

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit
GCIC from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable U.S.
federal or state Law with regard to any Takeover Proposal or (ii) making any
disclosure to GCIC's stockholders if, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, GCIC determines that such disclosure would be required under
applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such disclosures (other
than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
to be a GCIC Adverse Recommendation Change unless the GCIC Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the GCIC Recommendation (i) in such communication or (ii)
within three (3) Business Days after being requested in writing to do so by
GBDC.

7.8 _GBDC Takeover Proposals_.

  



  

(a) If on or after the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to
the GBDC Stockholders Meeting: (i) GBDC receives a bona fide
unsolicited Takeover Proposal (under circumstances in which GBDC has complied
in all material respects with the provisions of _Sections 7.6(a)_  and _(b)_
); (ii) the GBDC Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors of
GBDC, shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that (x) failure to consider such Takeover Proposal
would be reasonably likely to be a breach of the standard of conduct
applicable to the directors of GBDC under applicable Law and (y) such
Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a GBDC
Superior Proposal; and (iii) GBDC gives GCIC at least two (2) Business Days
prior written notice of the identity of the Person making such Takeover
Proposal, the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and GBDC's
intention to furnish information to, or participate in discussions or
negotiations with, the Person making such Takeover Proposal then, subject to
compliance with this _Section 7.8(a)_ , GBDC may:

  



  

(i) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Person who has made
the unsolicited bona fide Takeover Proposal and provide information in
response to a request therefor by a Person who has made such Takeover Proposal
if GBDC (A) receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement
with customary terms (including a standstill) and (B) provides GCIC a copy of
all such information that has not previously been delivered to GCIC
simultaneously with delivery to such Person (or such Person's
Representatives or Affiliates); and

  



  

(ii) after fulfilling its obligations under _Section 7.8(b)_ below,
effect a Takeover Approval.

  



  

If on or after the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to the GBDC
Stockholders Meeting, the GBDC Board, including a majority of the Independent
Directors of GBDC, shall have determined, by a majority of its members, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that continued recommendation of
the GBDC Matters to GBDC's stockholders would be reasonably likely to be a
breach of the standard of conduct applicable to the directors of GBDC under
applicable Law as a result of a GBDC Superior Proposal, GBDC may (A) withdraw
or qualify (or modify or amend in a manner adverse to GCIC), or publicly
propose to withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in a manner adverse to
GCIC), the approval, adoption, recommendation or declaration of advisability
by the GBDC Board of the GBDC Matters, including the recommendation of the
GBDC Board that the stockholders of GBDC approve the GBDC Matters (the " _GBDC
Recommendation_ "), and (B) take any action or make any statement, filing or
release, in connection with the GBDC Stockholders Meeting or otherwise,
inconsistent with the GBDC Recommendation (any action described in clause (A)
and (B) referred to collectively with any Takeover Approval as a " _GBDC
Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

(b) Upon any determination that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a GBDC
Superior Proposal, GBDC shall promptly provide (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours of such determination) to GCIC a written notice (a "
_Notice of a GBDC Superior Proposal_ ") (i) advising GCIC that the GBDC Board
has received a GBDC Superior Proposal, (ii) specifying in reasonable detail
the material terms and conditions of such GBDC Superior Proposal, including
the amount per share or other consideration that the stockholders of GBDC
will receive in connection with the Superior Proposal and including a copy of
all written materials provided to or by GBDC in connection with such GBDC
Superior Proposal (unless previously provided to GCIC) and (iii) identifying
the Person making such GBDC Superior Proposal. GBDC shall cooperate and
negotiate in good faith with GCIC (to the extent GCIC desires to negotiate)
during the five (5) calendar day period following GCIC's receipt of the
Notice of a GBDC Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such GBDC Superior Proposal
shall require a new notice and a new two (2) calendar day period) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
GBDC to determine that such GBDC Superior Proposal is no longer a GBDC
Superior Proposal and proceed with a GBDC Recommendation without a GBDC
Adverse Recommendation Change. If thereafter the GBDC Board determines, in its
reasonable good faith judgment, by a majority of its members, including a
majority of the Independent Directors of GBDC, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and after giving effect to any proposed adjustments to
the terms of this Agreement that such GBDC Superior Proposal remains a
GBDC Superior Proposal or the failure to make such GBDC Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be a breach of
the standard of conduct applicable to the directors of GBDC under applicable
Law, and GBDC has complied in all material respects with  _Section 7.8(a)_
above, GBDC may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(iv)_.

  



  

(c) Other than as permitted by _Section 7.8(a)_ , neither GBDC nor the
GBDC Board shall make any GBDC Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no GBDC Adverse Recommendation Change shall
change the approval of the GBDC Matters or any other approval of the GBDC
Board, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing any
Takeover Statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the
Transactions.

  



  

(d) GBDC shall provide GCIC with prompt written notice of any meeting
of the GBDC Board at which the GBDC Board is reasonably expected to consider
any Takeover Proposal (such written notice shall in any event be received by
GCIC reasonably in advance of such meeting).

  



  

(e) Other than in connection with an GBDC Takeover Proposal, nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the GBDC Board from taking any
action described in clause (A) of the definition of GBDC Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event (a " _GBDC
Intervening Event Recommendation Change_ ") if (A) prior to effecting any such
GBDC Intervening Event Recommendation Change, GBDC promptly notifies GCIC, in
writing, at least five (5) Business Days (the " _GBDC Intervening Event
Notice Period_ ") before taking such action of its intent to consider such
action (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute an GBDC Adverse
Recommendation Change or an GBDC Intervening Event Recommendation Change), and
which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of the
underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for taking, such action, (B)
GBDC shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the GBDC
Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate with GCIC in good faith (to the
extent GCIC desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that would not permit the GBDC Board to make a
GBDC Intervening Event Recommendation Change, and (C) the GBDC Board,
including a majority of the Independent Directors of GBDC, (or a committee
including a majority of the Independent Directors of GBDC thereof) determines,
after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
the failure to effect such a GBDC Intervening Event Recommendation Change, as
applicable, after taking into account any adjustments made by GCIC during the
GBDC Intervening Event Notice Period, would be reasonably likely to be a
breach of the standard of conduct applicable to the directors of GBDC under
applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit
GBDC from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable U.S.
federal or state Law with regard to any Takeover Proposal or (ii) making any
disclosure to GBDC's stockholders if, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, GBDC determines that such disclosure would be required under
applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such disclosures (other
than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
to be a GBDC Adverse Recommendation Change unless the GBDC Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the GBDC Recommendation (i) in such communication or (ii)
within three (3) Business Days after being requested in writing to do so by
GCIC.

  



  

7.9 _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) Upon reasonable notice, except as may otherwise be restricted by
applicable Law, each of GCIC and GBDC shall, and shall cause each of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries to, afford to the directors, officers, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other Representatives of the other party, reasonable
access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to its properties, books, Contracts, and records and, during such
period, such party shall, and shall cause its Consolidated Subsidiaries to,
make available (including via EDGAR) to the other party all other information
concerning its business and properties as the other party may reasonably
request; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not require GCIC or GBDC, as
applicable, to afford access to or to disclose any information that in such
party's reasonable judgment would violate any confidentiality obligations to
which such party is subject to if after using its reasonable best efforts
with respect thereto, it was unable to obtain any required consent to provide
such access or make such disclosure; _provided_ , _further_ , that either GCIC
or GBDC may restrict access to the extent required by any applicable Law or
as may be necessary to preserve attorney-client privilege under any
circumstances in which such privilege may be jeopardized by such disclosure
or access.

  



  

(b) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall
affect or be deemed to modify the representations and warranties of the other
party set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

7.10 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
Transactions shall be a joint press release reasonably acceptable to each of
GBDC and GCIC. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, GBDC and
GCIC each shall consult with the other before issuing or causing the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement, the Mergers, or the Transactions, except as may be required
by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq and, to the
extent practicable, before such press release or disclosure is issued or
made, GBDC or GCIC, as applicable, shall have used commercially reasonable
efforts to advise the other party of, and consult with the other party
regarding, the text of such disclosure; _provided_ , that either GBDC or GCIC
may make any public statement in response to specific questions by analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls, so long as any such statements are consistent with previous
press releases, public disclosures or public statements made in compliance
with this _Section 7.10_.

(b) _RIC Status_. During the period from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, except as expressly contemplated or permitted by this
Agreement, (i) GCIC shall not, and shall not permit any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of
GBDC take any action, or knowingly fail to take any action, which action or
failure to act is reasonably likely to cause GCIC to fail to qualify as a
RIC, and (ii) GBDC shall not, and shall not permit any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of
GCIC, take any action, or knowingly fail to take any action, which action or
failure to act is reasonably likely to cause GBDC to fail to qualify as a RIC.

  



  

(c) _Tax Treatment of Mergers_. Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law or administrative action, (i) each of GCIC, GBDC and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify as a reorganization governed by Section 368(a) of the Code, including
by not taking any action that such party knows is reasonably likely to prevent
such qualification; and (ii) each of GCIC, GBDC and Merger Sub shall report
the Mergers for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a reorganization governed

Each of GCIC and GBDC (i) shall keep the other party reasonably informed of
any material developments in connection with any such Proceeding brought by
its stockholders and (ii) shall not settle any such Proceeding without the
prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be
unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld).

  



  

7.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the
GCIC Board and the GBDC Board shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause any dispositions of GCIC Common Stock (including derivative securities

(including derivative securities with respect to GBDC Common Stock) resulting
from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting

case, to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3.

Date might reasonably be expected to occur, and neither GBDC nor GCIC shall
authorize or declare any dividend or distribution to its stockholders after
the Determination Date at any time on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit GBDC or GCIC from
authorizing, declaring or paying any dividend or distribution to its
stockholders solely payable in cash to the extent such dividend or
distribution is taken into account in determining the Closing GCIC Net
Asset Value and/or the Closing GBDC Net Asset Value, as applicable, including

Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference
shall be to an Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The terms "cash,"
"dollars" and "$" mean United States dollars. All schedules and exhibits
hereto shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference
to this Agreement. Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include the plural, and any plural term the singular. If any term, provision,
covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court or a
federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and
covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.
If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that any term,
provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, void or unenforceable, it is
the express intention of the parties that such term, provision, covenant or
restriction be enforced to the maximum extent permitted. The parties have
jointly participated in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event

11.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic means), all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective
when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other parties (including by facsimile or other electronic means), it being
understood that each party need not sign the same counterpart.

  



  

11.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and
the instruments referred to in this Agreement) constitutes the
entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement.

  



  

11.6 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This
Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Maryland applicable to contracts made and performed entirely
within such state, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law
principles that would cause the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction, except to the extent (a) governed by the Investment Company
Act, in which case the Investment Company Act shall control and (b) the Second
Merger is governed by the DGCL, in which case the DGCL shall control. The
parties hereto agree that any Proceeding brought by any party to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore City, Maryland, or if jurisdiction over the matter is vested
exclusively in federal courts, the United States District Court for the
District of Maryland, and the appellate courts to which orders and judgments
therefore may be appealed (collectively, the " _Acceptable Courts_ "). In any
such judicial proceeding, each of the parties further consents to the
assignment of any proceeding in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City,
Maryland to the Business and Technology Case Management Program pursuant to
Maryland Rule 16-205 (or any successor thereof). Each of the parties hereto
submits to the jurisdiction of any Acceptable Court in any Proceeding seeking
to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions and hereby irrevocably
waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or
otherwise in such Proceeding. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any Proceeding in any such Acceptable Court
or that any such Proceeding brought in any such Acceptable Court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of any action, suit or
proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) certifies that it makes
this waiver voluntarily and (c) acknowledges that it and the other parties
hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things,
the mutual waiver and certifications in this _Section 11.6_.

  



    

 | 81| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

11.7 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by any of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported
assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by each of the parties and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section
7.5_ , this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to in
this Agreement) is not intended to and does not confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies under this Agreement.

  



  

11.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any federal or state court located in the State of Maryland,
without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party hereto has an adequate remedy at law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity.

  



  

11.9 _Disclosure Schedule_. Before entry into this Agreement, GBDC,
GCIC and GC Advisors each delivered to the other party a schedule (the "
_GBDC Disclosure Schedule_ ", the " _GCIC Disclosure Schedule_ " and the "
_GC Advisors Disclosure Schedule_ ", respectively, each, a " _Disclosure
Schedule_ ") that sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of
which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ , as
applicable, or to one or more covenants contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation
or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
Disclosure Schedule shall be numbered to correspond with the sections and
subsections contained in this Agreement. The disclosure in any section or
subsection of each Disclosure Schedule, shall qualify only (i) the
corresponding section or subsection, as the case may be, of this Agreement,
(ii) other sections or subsections of this Agreement to the
extent specifically cross-referenced in such section or subsection thereof,
and (iii) other sections or subsections of this Agreement to the extent it is
reasonably apparent from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to such other sections or subsections.

to the provisions of this Agreement, (i) determine the composition of the
portfolio of the Corporation, the nature and timing of the changes therein
and the manner of implementing such changes; (ii) identify, evaluate and
negotiate the structure of the investments made by the Corporation (including
performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies); (iii) execute,
close, service and monitor the Corporation's investments; (iv) determine
the securities and other assets that the Corporation will purchase, retain or
sell; and (v) provide the Corporation with such other investment advisory,
research and related services as the Corporation may, from time to time,
reasonably require for the investment of its funds. The Adviser shall have
the power and authority on behalf of the Corporation to effectuate its
investment decisions for the Corporation, including the execution and
delivery of all documents relating to the Corporation's investments and the
placing of orders for other purchase or sale transactions on behalf of the
Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to acquire debt
financing or to refinance existing debt financing, the Adviser shall arrange
for such financing on the Corporation's behalf, subject to the oversight and
approval of the Board of Directors. If it is necessary for the Adviser to
make investments on behalf of the Corporation through a subsidiary or special
purpose vehicle, the Adviser shall have authority to create or arrange for
the creation of such subsidiary or special purpose vehicle and to make such
investments through such subsidiary or special purpose vehicle in accordance
with the Investment Company Act.

federal and state law.

upon the Corporation's request, provided that the Adviser may retain a copy of
such records.

2. _Corporation 's Responsibilities and Expenses Payable by the Corporation_. All investment professionals of the Adviser and their respective staffs, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services hereunder, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, shall be provided and paid for by the Adviser and not by the Corporation. The Corporation shall bear all other costs and expenses of its operations and transactions, including, without limitation, those relating to: (a) organization of the Corporation; (b) calculations of the net asset value of the Corporation, including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm; (c) fees and expenses incurred by the Adviser and payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in connection with monitoring the financial and legal affairs of the Corporation and in monitoring the Corporation's investments, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments; (d) interest payable on debt, if any, incurred by the Corporation to finance its investments and expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts; (e) offerings of the common stock and other securities of the Corporation, including any public offering of the common stock of the Corporation; (f) investment advisory and management fees; (g) administration fees payable under the administration agreement dated April 10, 2010 (as amended, the " _Administration Agreement_ "), between the Corporation and the Corporation's administrator (the " _Administrator_ "); (h) fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments, including costs associated with meeting potential financial sponsors; (i) fees incurred by the Corporation in connection with the services of transfer agents and dividend agents and custodial fees and expenses; (j) federal and state registration fees; (k) all costs of registration and listing the Corporation's securities on any securities exchange; (l) federal, state and local taxes; (m) independent Directors' fees and expenses; (n) costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators; (o) costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs; (p) costs associated with individual or group stockholders; (q) the Corporation's allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors' and officers' errors and omissions liability insurance policies, and any other insurance premiums; (r) direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; (s) proxy voting expenses; and (t) any and all other expenses incurred by the Corporation or the Administrator in connection with administering the Corporation's business, including payments made under the Administration Agreement based upon the Corporation's allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of the Corporation's chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs.

  



  

3. _Compensation of the Adviser_. The Corporation agrees to pay, and the Adviser agrees to accept, as compensation for the investment advisory and management services provided by the Adviser hereunder, a fee consisting of two components: a base management fee (the " _Base Management Fee_ ") and an incentive fee (the " _Incentive Fee_ "), each as hereinafter set forth. The Corporation shall make any payments due hereunder to the Adviser or to the Adviser's designee as the Adviser may otherwise direct. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Adviser may elect, or adopt a deferred compensation plan pursuant to which it may elect to defer all or a portion of its fees hereunder for a specified period of time.

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) The Base Management Fee shall be calculated at an annual rate equal
to 1.375% of the average adjusted gross assets of the Corporation. As
described below, average adjusted gross assets of the Corporation for any
period shall exclude cash and cash equivalents and include assets purchased
by the Corporation with borrowed funds. For services rendered under this
Agreement, the Base Management Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears. The
Base Management Fee shall be calculated based on the average value of the
gross assets of the Corporation at the end of the two most recently completed
calendar quarters. Such amount shall be appropriately adjusted (based on the
actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such
calendar quarter) for any share issuances or repurchases during a calendar
quarter. The Base Management Fee for any partial month or quarter shall be
appropriately pro-rated (based on the number of days actually elapsed at the
end of such partial month or quarter relative to the total number of days in
such month or quarter). For purposes of this Agreement, cash equivalents shall
mean U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing
within 270 days of the date of purchase of such instrument by the Corporation.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that the
Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser provides investment advisory,
collateral management or other similar services to a subsidiary of the
Corporation, the Base Management Fee shall be reduced by an amount equal to
the product of (a) the total fees paid to the Adviser by such subsidiary for
such services and (b) the percentage of such subsidiary's total equity that
is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation.

  



  

(b) The Incentive Fee shall be calculated and paid as set forth on
Schedule A hereto, as such schedule may be amended from time to time.

  



  

(c) As set forth in Schedule A hereto, the Incentive Fee calculation
shall include a limitation such that the Corporation can only pay an
Incentive Fee for any quarter to the Adviser if, after giving effect to such
payment, the cumulative Incentives Fees paid per share of common stock of the
Corporation to the Adviser from the date on which the Corporation elected to
be treated as a business development company through and the date of such
payment would be less than or equal to 20% of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive
Fee Net Income Per Share (as such term is defined in Schedule A hereto) of
the Corporation.

  



  

4. _Covenants of the Adviser_. The Adviser hereby covenants that it is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. The Adviser hereby agrees that its activities shall at all times be in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal and state laws governing its operations and investments.

  



  

5. _Excess Brokerage Commissions_. The Adviser is hereby authorized, to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by law, to cause the Corporation to pay a member of a national securities exchange, broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission another member of such exchange, broker or dealer would have charged for effecting such transaction if the Adviser determines, in good faith and taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, and operational facilities of the firm and the firm's risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities, that the amount of such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and/or research services provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or its overall responsibilities with respect to the Corporation's portfolio, and constitutes the best net result for the Corporation.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6. _Proxy Voting_. The Adviser shall be responsible for voting any proxies solicited by an issuer of securities held by the Corporation in the best interest of the Corporation and in accordance with the Adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures, as any such proxy voting policies and procedures may be amended from time to time. The Corporation has been provided with a copy of the Adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures and has been informed as to how it can obtain further information from the Adviser regarding proxy voting activities undertaken on behalf of the Corporation. The Adviser shall be responsible for reporting the Corporation's proxy voting activities, as required, through periodic filings on Form N-PX.

  



  

7. _Limitations on the Employment of the Adviser_. The services of the Adviser to the Corporation are not, and shall not be, exclusive. The Adviser may engage in any other business or render similar or different services to others including, without limitation, the direct or indirect sponsorship or management of other investment based accounts or commingled pools of capital, however structured, having investment objectives similar to those of the Corporation; provided that its services to the Corporation hereunder are not impaired thereby. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any manager, partner, officer or employee of the Adviser to engage in any other business or to devote his or her time and attention in part to any other business, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature, or to receive any fees or compensation in connection therewith (including fees for serving as a director of, or providing consulting services to, one or more of the portfolio companies of the Corporation, subject at all times to applicable law). So long as this Agreement or any extension, renewal or amendment hereof remains in effect, the Adviser shall be the only investment adviser for the Corporation, subject to the Adviser's right to enter into sub-advisory agreements. The Adviser assumes no responsibility under this Agreement other than to render the services called for hereunder. It is understood that directors, officers, employees and stockholders of the Corporation are or may become interested in the Adviser and its affiliates, as directors, officers, employees, partners, stockholders, members, managers or otherwise, and that the Adviser and directors, officers, employees, partners, stockholders, members and managers of the Adviser and its affiliates are or may become similarly interested in the Corporation as stockholders or otherwise.

  



  

Subject to any restrictions prescribed by law, by the provisions of the Code
of Ethics of the Corporation and the Adviser and by the Adviser's
Allocation Policy, the Adviser and its members, officers, employees and
agents shall be free from time to time to acquire, possess, manage and
dispose of securities or other investment assets for their own accounts, for
the accounts of their family members, for the account of any entity in which
they have a beneficial interest or for the accounts of others for whom they
may provide investment advisory, brokerage or other services (collectively, "
_Managed Accounts_ "), in transactions that may or may not correspond with
transactions effected or positions held by the Corporation or to give advice
and take action with respect to Managed Accounts that differs from advice
given to, or action taken on behalf of, the Corporation; provided that the
Adviser allocates investment opportunities to the Corporation, over a period
of time on a fair and equitable basis compared to investment
opportunities extended to other Managed Accounts. The Adviser is not, and
shall not be, obligated to initiate the purchase or sale for the
Corporation of any security that the Adviser and its members, officers,
employees or agents may purchase or sell for its or their own accounts or for
the account of any other client if, in the opinion of the Adviser, such
transaction or investment appears unsuitable or undesirable for the
Corporation. Moreover, it is understood that when the Adviser determines that
it would be appropriate for the Corporation and one or more Managed Accounts
to participate in the same investment opportunity, the Adviser shall seek to
execute orders for the Corporation and for such Managed Account(s) on a basis
that the Adviser considers to be fair and equitable over time. In such
situations, the Adviser may (but is not required to) place orders for the
Corporation and each Managed Account simultaneously or on an aggregated
basis. If all such orders are not filled at the same price, the Adviser may
cause the Corporation and each Managed Account to pay or receive the average
of the prices at which the orders were filled for the Corporation and all
relevant Managed Accounts on each applicable day. If all such orders cannot be
fully executed under prevailing market conditions, the Adviser may allocate
the investment opportunities among participating accounts in a manner that the
Adviser considers equitable, taking into account, among other things, the
size of each account, the size of the order placed for each account and any
other factors that the Adviser deems relevant.

8. _Responsibility of Dual Directors, Officers and/or Employees_. If any person who is a manager, partner, officer or employee of the Adviser or the Administrator is or becomes a director, officer and/or employee of the Corporation and acts as such in any business of the Corporation, then such manager, partner, officer and/or employee of the Adviser or the Administrator shall be deemed to be acting in such capacity solely for the Corporation and not as a manager, partner, officer and/or employee of the Adviser or the Administrator or under the control or direction of the Adviser or the Administrator, even if paid by the Adviser or the Administrator.

  



  

9. _Limitation of Liability of the Adviser; Indemnification_. The Adviser (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, including without limitation its general partner and the Administrator) shall not be liable to the Corporation for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Adviser in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as an investment adviser of the Corporation, except to the extent specified in Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act concerning loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty (as the same is finally determined by judicial proceedings) with respect to the receipt of compensation for services, and the Corporation shall indemnify, defend and protect the Adviser (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, including without limitation its general partner and the Administrator, each of whom shall be deemed a third party beneficiary hereof) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold them harmless from and against all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation or its security holders) arising out of or otherwise based upon the performance of any of the Adviser's duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as an investment adviser of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Paragraph 9 to the contrary, nothing contained herein shall protect or be deemed to protect the Indemnified Parties against or entitle or be deemed to entitle the Indemnified Parties to indemnification in respect of, any liability to the Corporation or its security holders to which the Indemnified Parties would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of the Adviser's duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of the Adviser's duties and obligations under this Agreement (as the same shall be determined in accordance with the Investment Company Act and any interpretations or guidance by the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff thereunder).

This Agreement shall continue for the term of the Prior Agreement, and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a) the vote of the Board of Directors or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Corporation and (b) the vote of a majority of the Corporation's Directors who are not parties to this Agreement or "interested persons" (as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act) of any such party, in accordance with the requirements of the Investment Company Act. This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon 60 days' written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Corporation, or by the vote of the Corporation's Directors or by the Adviser. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its "assignment" (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 15(a)(4) of the Investment Company Act). The provisions of Section 9 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and the Adviser shall remain entitled to the benefits thereof, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. Further, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of this Agreement as aforesaid, the Adviser shall be entitled to any amounts owed under Section 3 through the date of termination or expiration and Section 9 shall continue in force and effect and apply to the Adviser and its representatives as and to the extent applicable.

 _SCHEDULE A 
  
 _Calculation and Payment of Incentive Fee

  



  

The Incentive Fee shall be calculated as provided below and payable (i)
quarterly in arrears or (ii) in the event that the Investment
Advisory Agreement is terminated, as of the termination date (each, a "
_Performance Period_ "). The Adviser shall not be required to reimburse the
Corporation for any part of an Incentive Fee it receives that was based on
accrued interest that the Corporation accrues but never actually receives.

  

 _ _

  

 _Income and Capital Gains Incentive Fee Calculation_

  



  

The income and capital gains incentive fee calculation (the " _Income and
Capital Gains Incentive Fee Calculation_ ") has two parts: (i) the income
component and (ii) the capital gains component.

  

 _ _

  

 _ _Income Component__

  



  

The income component (the " _Income Incentive Fee_ ") is calculated in
arrears for each Performance Period based on the Pre-Incentive Fee Net
Investment Income of the Corporation for the immediately preceding Performance
Period.

  



  

"Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income" means, with respect to any
Performance Period, interest income, dividend income and any other income
(including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring,
diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Corporation receives
from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial
assistance) accrued during such period, minus operating expenses for such
period (including the Base Management Fee, taxes, any expenses payable under
the Agreement and the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and
dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding
the Incentive Fee, if any). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes,
in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market
discount, debt instruments with payment in kind ("PIK") interest, preferred
stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities, accrued income that the
Corporation has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net
Investment Income shall not include any realized capital gains, realized
capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation or any
amortization or accretion of any purchase premium or purchase discount to
interest income resulting solely from the purchase accounting for any premium
or discount paid for the acquisition of assets in a merger.

  



  

Once calculated, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate
of return on the value of the net assets of the Corporation at the end of the
immediately preceding calendar quarter, shall be compared to a fixed "hurdle
rate" of 2.0% quarterly. For purposes of this calculation, net assets for any
period shall be equal to total assets less indebtedness of the Corporation,
before taking into account any Incentive Fees payable during such period.
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income used to calculate the income component
of the Incentive Fee shall also be included in the amount of the total assets
of the Corporation used to calculate the Base Management Fee. For purposes of
this calculation, total assets of the Corporation shall exclude cash and cash
equivalents and shall include assets purchased with borrowed funds.

  



    

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

The income component of the Income and Capital Gains Incentive Fee
Calculation with respect to the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income of the
Corporation shall be calculated for each Performance Period, in arrears, as
follows:

  



   | *| zero in any Performance Period in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net
Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| 100.0% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income of the
Corporation with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net
Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%
in any Performance Period; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| 20.0% of the amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
of the Corporation, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any Performance Period. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, which exceeds the
hurdle rate but is less than 2.5% is the "catch-up" provision. These
calculations shall be appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or
repurchases during the Performance Period (based on the actual number of days
elapsed relative to the total number of days in such Performance Period).

  

 _ _

  

 _ _Capital Gains Component__

  



  

The second part of the Income and Capital Gain Incentive Fee Calculation (the
" _Capital Gain Incentive Fee_ ") shall equal (a) 20.0% of the Capital Gain
Incentive Fee Base of the Corporation (as defined below), if any, calculated
in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the
Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing with the year ending
December 31, 2010, less (b) the aggregate amount of any previously paid
Capital Gain Incentive Fees. For purposes of this calculation, the
Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base shall equal (1) the sum of (A) the realized
capital gains of the Corporation, if any, on a cumulative positive basis from
the date of the Corporation's election to be treated as a business development
company through the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the
Agreement as of the termination date), (B) all realized capital losses of the
Corporation on a cumulative basis and (C) all unrealized capital depreciation
of the Corporation on a cumulative basis, less (2) unamortized deferred
financing costs of the Corporation as of the date of calculation, if and to
the extent such costs exceed all unrealized capital appreciation on a
cumulative basis.

  



  

The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains of the Corporation shall be
calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net
sales price of each investment in the Corporation's portfolio when sold and
(b) the adjusted cost basis (as defined below) of such investment. The
cumulative aggregate realized capital losses of the Corporation shall be
calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each
investment in the Corporation's portfolio when sold is less than (b) the
adjusted cost basis of such investment. The aggregate unrealized capital
depreciation of the Corporation shall be calculated as the sum of the
differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the
Corporation's portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gain Incentive Fee
calculation date and (b) the adjusted cost basis of such investment.

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

The "adjusted cost basis" of an investment shall be equal to the accreted or
amortized cost basis of such investment adjusted to exclude amounts, if any,
recognized solely from the purchase accounting for any premium or discount
paid for the acquisition of assets in a merger.

  



  

The sum of the Income Incentive Fee and the Capital Gain Incentive Fee shall
be the Incentive Fee.

  

 _ _

  

 _Limitation on Incentive Fee_

  



  

Each quarterly Incentive Fee payable on the Income and Capital Gain Incentive
Fee Calculation shall be subject to a cap (the " _Incentive Fee Cap_ "). The
Incentive Fee Cap in any Performance Period shall be equal to the difference
between (a) 20.0% of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share (as
defined below) and (b) Cumulative Incentive Fees Paid Per Share (as defined
below). To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value in
any Performance Period, no Incentive Fee shall be payable in that
Performance Period. "Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share" shall
be equal to the "Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share" (as defined below)
for each Performance Period since April 13, 2010, the effective date of the
Corporation's election to be treated as a business development company. "Pre-
Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share" shall be equal to (a) the sum of (i) Pre-
Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and (ii) Adjusted Capital Returns (as
defined below) for the Performance Period divided by (b) the weighted average
number of shares of common stock of the Corporation outstanding during such
Performance Period. "Adjusted Capital Returns" for any Performance Period
shall be the sum of the realized aggregate capital gains, realized aggregate
capital losses, aggregate unrealized capital depreciation and aggregate
unrealized capital appreciation for such Performance Period; provided that
the calculation of realized aggregate capital gains, realized aggregate
capital losses, aggregate unrealized capital depreciation and aggregate
unrealized capital appreciation shall be calculated based on the
adjusted cost basis (as defined above) of each investment of the Corporation.
"Cumulative Incentive Fees Paid Per Share" is equal to the sum of Incentive
Fees Paid Per Share for each Performance Period since April 13, 2010.
"Incentive Fees Paid Per Share" for any Performance Period is equal to the
Incentive Fees accrued and/or payable by the Corporation for such
Performance Period divided by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock of the Corporation outstanding during such Performance Period.

  



  

If, for any relevant Performance Period, the Incentive Fee Cap calculation
results in the Corporation paying less than the amount of the Incentive
Fee calculated above, then the difference between (a) the Incentive Fees
accrued and/or payable by the Corporation for such Performance Period and (b)
the Incentive Fee Cap multiplied by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock of the Corporation outstanding during such Performance Period
shall not be paid by the Corporation, and shall not be received by the
Adviser, as an Incentive Fee, either at the end of such relevant Performance
Period or at the end of any future Performance Period.
