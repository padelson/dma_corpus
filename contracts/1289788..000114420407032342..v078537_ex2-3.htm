7. _Acknowledgments  by Assignee_.  Assignee hereby acknowledges and agrees that: (a) none of Assignor, its  affiliates or Allied Capital Corporation in its capacity as Seller  Representative under the MAC/Macquarie SPA (the "Seller Representative") has  made, or is making hereby, any representations, warranties or covenants  regarding the transactions contemplated by the San Jose Purchase Agreement,  the  assets owned by the San Jose Sellers, the due diligence materials regarding  the  San Jose Sellers and their assets provided to Assignee by the Seller  Representative or the ability to consummate the transactions contemplated  by the  San Jose Purchase Agreement; (b) it shall be solely responsible for performing  its own investigation and due diligence review of the San Jose Sellers, the  assets owned by the San Jose Sellers and the transactions contemplated by  the  San Jose Purchase Agreement; (c) the Seller Representative has not made,  and is  not making hereby, any statements, certifications, representations or  warranties, express or implied, regarding the truth, accuracy or completeness  of  the due diligence materials regarding the San Jose Sellers and their assets  provided by it to Assignee; and (d) none of the Sellers, the Company or the  Seller Representative has or shall have any liability to Assignee for any  reason  regarding, directly or indirectly, the transactions contemplated by the San  Jose  Purchase Agreement, the assets owned by the San Jose Sellers, the due diligence  materials regarding the San Jose Sellers and their assets provided to Assignee  by the Seller Representative, the negotiations conducted by the Seller  Representative regarding the transactions contemplated by the San Jose Purchase  Agreement or the ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the  San  Jose Purchase Agreement.
