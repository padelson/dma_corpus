ARTICLE 2. 
PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES

Section 2.1 Basic Transaction.

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Closing, Buyer shall purchase from Sellers, and Sellers shall sell to
Buyer, all of the Shares for aggregate consideration equal to the sum of the
Cash Payment plus the Equity Payment (the "Purchase Price").

(b) At Closing, Buyer shall (i) pay to the Sellers an amount in cash equal to
One Billion Two Hundred Sixty Million Dollars ($1,260,000,000), as adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.2, minus the aggregate amount of all Transaction
Expenses that remain unpaid at the Closing, minus the aggregate amount of all
Change of Control Payments that remain unpaid at the Closing (as so
calculated, the "Cash Payment"), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account(s) designated by Sellers' Representative (the account(s)
must be designated at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date),
and (ii) issue to the Sellers an aggregate number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock (the "Buyer Shares") equal to (x) One Hundred Forty Million Dollars
($140,000,000) divided by (y) the Buyer Common Stock Value (the "Equity
Payment"), to be delivered to the Sellers designated to receive all or part of
the Equity Payment (the "Equity Payment Recipients").

Section 2.2 Purchase Price Adjustments.

The Cash Payment shall be adjusted (x) upward on a dollar‑for‑dollar basis by
the amount of any Closing Cash and (y) downward on a dollar‑for‑dollar basis
by the amount of Closing Indebtedness, in each case as of the Business Day
before the Closing Date as set forth below; provided, however, that any
Transaction Expenses to be paid by the Company at the Closing shall not be
included as Closing Cash for purposes of this Section 2.2:

(a) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer an officer's certificate of the
Company that contains a good faith and reasonable best estimate of the Closing
Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash") and Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated
Closing Indebtedness"), in each case as of the close of business on the
Business Day before the Closing Date. The Cash Payment payable to the Sellers
at the Closing

 pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be increased by an amount equal to the Estimated
Closing Cash and decreased by an amount equal to the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness.

(b) Within thirty (30) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Sellers' Representative a good faith calculation of
the actual Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness and the amount, if any, by
which the Closing Cash and the Closing Indebtedness so determined is less than
or greater than the Estimated Closing Cash and Estimated Closing Indebtedness,
respectively (the "Closing Statement"). Buyer shall cooperate as reasonably
requested by Sellers' Representative in connection with Sellers'
Representative's review of the Closing Statement. Sellers' Representative may
dispute Buyer's calculation of the Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness set
forth on the Closing Statement by delivering a written notice (a "Notice of
Disagreement") to Buyer within 15 days following delivery of the Closing
Statement. During the 15 days following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement,
Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement.

(c) If Buyer and Sellers' Representative have not resolved all issues at the
end of the 15-day period referred to in Section 2.2(b), the parties shall
submit to Deloitte and Touche LLP (the "Accounting Firm") for review and
resolution of such matters which remain in dispute, and the Accounting Firm
shall make a final determination of the Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness
and the amount, if any, by which the Closing Cash and the Closing Indebtedness
so determined is less than or greater than the Estimated Closing Cash and
Estimated Closing Indebtedness, respectively, in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement. The parties will
cooperate with the Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement. The
Accounting Firm's determination will be based solely on presentations by Buyer
and Seller or their respective representatives which are in accordance with
the definitions set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review). The determination of the Closing Cash and Closing
Indebtedness shall become final and binding on the parties on the date the
Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the parties (which
final resolution shall be delivered not more than 30 days following submission
of such disputed matters). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be shared equally by Buyer and Seller.

(d) If the Closing Cash calculated in accordance with Section 2.2(b) is
greater than the Estimated Closing Cash or the Closing Indebtedness determined
in accordance with Section 2.2(b) is less than the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, then Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) pay to the Sellers the absolute value of such difference, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by the Sellers' Representative. If the Closing Cash
calculated in accordance with Section 2.2(b) is less than the Estimated
Closing Cash or the Closing Indebtedness calculated in accordance with Section
2.2(b) is greater than the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, then the Sellers
shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) pay to Buyer
the absolute value of such difference by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Buyer.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.2, the parties
agree that the reconciliation amounts due from Buyer to the Sellers and from
the Sellers to Buyer pursuant

 to Section 2.2(c) hereof shall be aggregated and offset one against the other
such that only Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers, on the other hand,
shall be required to make one payment to the other party hereunder.

Section 2.3 Closing.

(a) The purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated by this Agreement shall
take place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held on the later of (i) the
second Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 7 (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waiver of those conditions) at the Detroit offices of Honigman Miller Schwartz
and Cohn LLP, and (ii) the date set, at Buyer's option, to a date no later
than forty-five (45) calendar days following the date of this Agreement, or
(ii) another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Buyer and the
Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the "Closing Date" and the time on the Closing Date that the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time", which the parties
agree will be 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date.

(b) At the Closing:

(i) Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the Cash Payment and issue to the Sellers
the Equity Payment, each in accordance with Section 2.1(b);

(ii) Buyer shall deliver to Sellers all other agreements, documents,
instruments or certificates required to be delivered by Buyer at or prior to
the Closing pursuant to Section 7.2;

(iii) Sellers shall deliver to Buyer the certificates representing the Shares,
free and clear of all Encumbrances, in each case, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by duly executed stock powers, or such other duly executed
instruments of transfer, with all required stock transfer tax stamps affixed
thereto; and

(iv) Sellers shall deliver to Buyer all other agreements, documents,
instruments or certificates required to be delivered by Sellers at or prior to
the Closing pursuant to Section 7.3.

other party thereto under the Financing Commitment. As of the date of this

Sellers set forth in ARTICLE 3 and ARTICLE 4, Buyer does not have any

result in any of the terms or conditions in the Financing Commitment not being
satisfied on a timely basis, or (ii) otherwise result in the Financing not

fees or other fees under the Financing Commitment will be duly paid in full by

and conditions required to be satisfied by them pursuant to the terms of the

purposes and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof. Buyer acknowledges that the Shares are not registered
under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and that the Shares
may not be transferred or sold except pursuant to the registration provisions
of the Securities Act or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and
subject to state securities laws and regulations, as applicable. Buyer is able
to bear the economic risk of holding the Shares for an indefinite period
(including total loss of its investment), and has sufficient knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risk of its investment.

Section 5.9 Solvency.

Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to Buyer's obligation to
consummate the Share Purchase, (b) accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Sellers set forth in ARTICLE 3 and ARTICLE 4 (for such
purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all
material respects), and (c) that all estimates, projections and forecasts of
the Transferred Companies provided to Buyer were prepared in good faith based
upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, immediately after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Share Purchase, the Financing, the payment of the aggregate Purchase
Price, any repayment of existing Indebtedness contemplated by this Agreement
or the Financing Commitment, and the payment of all related fees and
expenses), Buyer will be Solvent. No transfer of property is being made and no
obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the closing of any financing to be obtained by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates in order to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of Buyer. "Solvent" means that, as of any date of determination and
with respect to any Person: (i) the fair value of the assets of such Person
and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater than the total
amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of such Person and
its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (ii) the present fair saleable
value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis,

 is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on
their debts and liabilities as they become absolute and matured, (iii) such
Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are not engaged in
business or a transaction, and are not about to engage in business or a
transaction, for which such Person's and its Subsidiaries' assets, on a
consolidated basis, would constitute unreasonably small capital, and (iv) such
Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not intend to, and do
not believe that they will, incur debts or liabilities beyond their ability to
pay such debts and liabilities as they mature; provided, however, the amount
of any contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that,
in light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at such time,
represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or
matured liability (irrespective of whether such contingent liabilities meet
the criteria for accrual under Accounting Standards Codification 450 -
Contingencies).

Section 5.10 No Other Representations or Warranties.

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any schedule or certificate
delivered to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, none of any Seller, any
Transferred Company, or any stockholder, director, officer or employee of any
Transferred Company makes or has made any representation or warranty
concerning the Transferred Companies, the stockholders, directors, officers or
employees of the Transferred Companies or any of their respective assets or
properties or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that all projections, budgets, forecasts and other
forward looking information provided to Buyer by or on behalf of the Sellers
or of the Transferred Companies are not representations or warranties of the
Sellers and are subject to uncertainties and that actual results may be
different from such projections, budgets, forecasts and other forward looking
information.

Except for M. Klein and Company, the fees of which will be paid by Buyer, no
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or
other fee or commission in connection with the Share Purchase and the other
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Buyer.

and where it is conducted on the Closing Date (a "Competitive Business");
provided, however, that it shall not be deemed to be a violation of this
Section 6.7(b) for any Seller or any of its Affiliates to invest in any Person

investment is less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding ownership
interest in such Person.

other manner persuade or attempt to persuade, any Person who is an employee of
any Transferred Company to leave the employ of such Transferred Company;
provided, however, that it shall not be deemed to be a violation of this
Section 6.7(b)(ii) for (a) any Seller to hire an employee of the Company who

Company or resigns therefrom to hire an employee of the Company who had worked
in an administrative position directly for such officer immediately before
such termination or resignation.

(iii) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that
any term or provision of this Section 6.7(b) is invalid or unenforceable, the
parties hereto agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration, territory
or other term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement will be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed.

respective obligations pursuant to, and the consummation of the transactions

party consults with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting. The

 parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as such parties may reasonably

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Continuing Employees shall be deemed
employees at will of the Transferred Companies or their successors, and

Company or its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Continuing
Employee or modify the terms and conditions of any Continuing Employee's
employment.

(e) If directed by Buyer no later than five Business Days before the Closing
Date, the Board of Directors shall adopt resolutions terminating any Plan that

receive any and all payments (or other benefits) contingent on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so
that no payment received by such "disqualified individual" shall be a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code (determined without
regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code). Such stockholder vote shall
establish the disqualified individual's right to the payment or other
compensation and the Company shall obtain any required waivers or consents
from the disqualified individual prior to the stockholder vote. In addition,
the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to Company stockholders that
hold Shares of all material facts concerning all payments to any such

(i) if the Share Purchase shall not have been consummated on or before
December 31, 2013 (the "Outside Date"); provided, that no party shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (i) if the
failure of the Share Purchase to be consummated on or before the Outside Date
was primarily due to, or the result of, the failure of such party to perform
or comply in any material respect with any of the obligations, covenants or
agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement; or

(ii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall

Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Sellers shall have
become untrue, which breach or failure to perform or to be true, either
individually or in the aggregate, if occurring or continuing at the Effective

Section 7.1 or Section 7.3, and (B) cannot be cured on or before the earlier
of (i) the Outside Date, and (ii) sixty (60) days after the date of delivery

or in the aggregate, if occurring or continuing at the Effective Time, (A)
would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1

resulting from a breach of this Agreement or fraud, in which case the non-
breaching party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law
or in equity; provided that if this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant
to Section 8.1(c), the Sellers will have no liability to Buyer for any breach
or default other than a "Willful Breach," which shall mean a deliberate act or
a deliberate failure to act by a party, which act or failure to act
constitutes in and of itself a breach of such party's representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement,
regardless of whether such breach was the conscious object of the act or
failure to act.

(collectively, the "Seller Group"), from and against any and all Losses
arising out of or caused by any of the following:

(a) Misrepresentation. Any breach of any warranty or representation contained
in ARTICLE 5 of this Agreement.

(b) Nonperformance. Any failure or refusal by Buyer to satisfy or perform any
covenant, term or condition of this Agreement required to be satisfied or

Section 9.3 Indemnification Procedures.

With respect to each event, occurrence or matter ("Indemnification Matter") as
to which any member of the Buyer Group or Seller Group, as the case may be (in
either case, referred to collectively as, the "Indemnitee"), is or may
reasonably be entitled to indemnification from the Sellers under Section 9.1
or from Buyer under Section 9.2, as the case may be (in either case referred
to collectively as, the "Indemnitor"):

(a) Notice. Within ten (10) calendar days after the Indemnitee receives
written notice of any claim by a third party with respect the Indemnification
Matter or, if the Indemnification Matter does not involve a third‑party
action, suit, claim or demand, within ten (10) calendar days after the
Indemnitee first has actual knowledge of the Indemnification Matter or of
other matters from which an Indemnification Matter is reasonably likely to
result, the Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Indemnitor of the
nature of the Indemnification Matter and the amount demanded or claimed in
connection therewith ("Indemnification Notice"), together with copies of any
available written documents relating to such Indemnification Matter. No delay
or deficiency by an Indemnitee to give notice in respect of a Loss in the
manner required by this Section 9.3 shall relieve the Indemnitor of any
liability under this Agreement in respect of such Loss except to the extent
that such delay or deficiency prejudices or otherwise adversely affects the
rights of the Indemnitor with respect thereto.

(b) Defense. If a third‑party action, suit, claim or demand (a "Third Party
Claim") is involved, then, upon receipt of the Indemnification Notice, the
Indemnitor shall have fifteen (15) calendar days after said notice is given to
elect, by written notice given to the Indemnitee, to undertake, conduct and
control, through counsel of its own choosing which is reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnitee and at its sole risk and expense, the good faith settlement or
defense of such claim, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnitor
in connection therewith; provided: (a) all settlements require the prior
reasonable consultation with the Indemnitee and the prior written consent of
the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided
that the Indemnitor may settle any such claim without the prior consent of the
Indemnitee if such settlement involves the full release of the Indemnitee and
the Indemnitor agrees to pay all amounts payable pursuant to such settlement,
and (b) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in such settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by the Indemnitee (the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee). So long as the Indemnitor is
contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnitee shall not pay or
settle any such claim; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnitee shall have the right to pay or settle any such claim at any
time; provided, that in such event, the Indemnitee shall waive any right of
indemnification

 therefor by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor does not make a timely election
to undertake the good faith defense or settlement of the claim as aforesaid,
or if the Indemnitor fails to proceed with the good faith defense or
settlement of the matter after making such election, then, in either such
event, the Indemnitee shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise
the claim at its exclusive discretion, retaining its right to seek
indemnification from Indemnitor. In addition, if an Indemnitee (a) determines
in good faith that a Third Party Claim may materially and adversely affect it
or any of its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which
it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, or (b) in the
good faith opinion of counsel of such party concludes that there are defenses
available to it that may be unavailable to, or inconsistent with or contrary
to the interests of the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee may, by notice to the
Indemnitor, retain the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such
Third Party Claim, retaining its right to seek indemnification from
Indemnitor. In any event, the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee shall fully
cooperate with each other in connection with the defense, including by
furnishing all available documentary or other evidence as is reasonably
requested by the other party.

(c) Payments. All amounts owed by the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee (if any)
shall be paid in full within ten (10) Business Days upon the earlier to occur
of (i) a final settlement or agreement as to the amount owed is agreed and
executed (unless otherwise provided in such final settlement or agreement) or
(ii) a final, nonappealable judgment has been rendered pursuant to Section
10.11 hereof requiring such indemnification payment.

Section 9.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

All representations and warranties, and all covenants and agreements to be
performed prior to Closing shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and
the Closing hereunder until the close of business on the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, that (i) the Fundamental
Representations shall survive indefinitely, (ii) Section 3.17 (Taxes) shall
survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations for the applicable underlying claim, including any extensions
or waivers thereof, and (iii) the covenants of the parties to be performed
after the Closing Date survive sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations for the applicable underlying claim or for
such length of time as are indicated by their respective terms. Any claims in
connection with fraud shall survive for the applicable statute of limitations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any breach of a representation or warranty or
covenant shall survive the time it would otherwise terminate if notice of such
breach is given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior
to the time of such expiration.

Section 9.5 Limits on Indemnification.

Subject to Section 9.6, the Sellers' liability under Section 9.1(a), Section
9.1(b) (provided that this shall not affect Sellers' obligations under Section
10.13 (specific performance)), and Section 9.1(e) through Section 9.1(g), and
the Buyer's liability under Section 9.2(a) and Section 9.2(b) (provided that
this shall not affect Buyer's obligations under Section 10.13 (specific
performance)) shall be limited as follows:

(a) Basket. No amount shall be payable for Losses by the Seller Group, on the
one hand, or the Buyer Group, on the other hand, as an Indemnitor unless and
until the aggregate

 amount otherwise payable by the Indemnitor under Section 9.1(a), Section
9.1(b) (provided that this shall not affect Sellers' obligations under Section
10.13 (specific performance)) and Section 9.1(e) through Section 9.1(g) or
Section 9.2(a) and Section 9.2(b) (provided that this shall not affect Buyer's
obligations under Section 10.13 (specific performance)), as applicable,
exceeds Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000) (the "Basket"), in which event the
Indemnitor shall pay only those amounts in excess of the Basket.

(b) Ceiling. The maximum liability of the Sellers under Section 9.1(a),
Section 9.1(b) and Section 9.1(e) through Section 9.1(g) and Buyer under
Section 9.2(a) for Losses shall not exceed, in each case, Seventy Million
Dollars ($70,000,000) (collectively, the "Ceiling").

Section 9.6 Exceptions to Limitations.

Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 9.5 hereof, neither the
Basket nor the Ceiling shall apply in the case of any Indemnification Matter
which arises out of, relates to, or involves Losses incurred due to a breach
of (i) the Fundamental Representations, or (ii) the Sellers' indemnification
obligations under Section 9.1(c) (Taxes) and Section 9.1(d) (Transaction
Expenses; Change of Control Payments).

Section 9.7 Mitigation.

Each party shall take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate and otherwise
minimize the Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event that would be
reasonably expected to give rise to any Indemnification Matter.

Section 9.8 Exclusive Remedy.

Buyer and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that, except for the right to seek
specific performance specifically set forth in Section 10.13, and the remedies
provided in Section 2.2 to address disputes or objections to the calculations
and adjustments described therein or as otherwise specifically provided
herein, the foregoing indemnification provisions in this ARTICLE 9 shall be
the exclusive remedy for monetary damages of Buyer and the Sellers with
respect to this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall prevent a party from
seeking injunctive relief or specific performance pursuant to Section 10.13.

Section 9.9 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments.

The parties agree to treat any indemnification payments made pursuant to this
Agreement as an adjustment to the final Purchase Price, unless a "Final
Determination" with respect to the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates
causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price. For purposes of this agreement "Final Determination" means (i) with
respect to federal income Taxes, a "determination" as defined in Section
1313(a) of the Code or execution of an IRS Form 870‑AD and (ii) with respect
to Taxes other than federal income Taxes, any final determination of liability
in respect of a Tax that, under applicable law, is not subject to further
appeal, review or modification through proceedings or otherwise (including the
expiration of a statute of limitations or a period for the filing of claims
for refunds, amended returns or appeals from adverse determinations).

 Section 9.10 Calculation of Losses.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for purposes of
determining the amount of any Losses that are the subject matter of a claim
for indemnification hereunder, the Basket shall be the aggregate materiality
standards for all purposes hereunder and, therefore, each representation,
warranty and other provision contained in this Agreement or in any Exhibit,
Schedule or certificate delivered hereunder shall be read without regard and
without giving effect to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect standard
or qualification contained in such representation or warranty (as if such
standard or qualification were deleted from such representation and warranty)
(other than in Section 3.7, but not disregarding any reference to
"materiality" contained in such representation or warranty). In addition, for
purposes of calculating Losses hereunder:

(a) the amount of any Losses hereunder will be reduced by the amount of any
accrual or reserve (in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practice and GAAP (taking into account, without limitation, applicable
rules regarding the proper timing for inclusion of items)) reflected on the
financial statements of the Transferred Companies as of the Closing Date;

(b) no party shall be entitled to recover Losses in respect of any claim or
otherwise obtain reimbursement or restitution more than once with respect to
any claim hereunder - without limiting the foregoing, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not be entitled to
indemnification with respect to any Losses as a result of, or based upon or
arising from, any claim or liability to the extent such claim or liability is
taken into account in determining the amount of any adjustment to the Purchase
Price in accordance with Section 2.2;

(c) if Indemnitor makes any indemnification payment pursuant to this ARTICLE 9
or otherwise by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby under any
theory of recovery, Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment and to the extent permitted by law, to any rights and remedies of the
Indemnitee to recoup amounts paid from third parties with respect to the
matters giving rise to indemnification hereunder;

(d) the amount of any and all Losses under this ARTICLE 9 shall be determined
net of any amounts recovered by Indemnitee under the insurance policies,
indemnities or other reimbursement arrangements of the Transferred Companies
with respect to such Losses (calculated net of any deductibles, co-payments,
increase in insurance premiums or other payment obligations (including
attorneys' fees and other costs of collection) resulting from the related
claims under applicable insurance policies); and

(e) The amount of any Loss claimed by an Indemnitee hereunder shall be reduced
to the extent of any Tax savings or benefits realized by the Indemnitee that
is attributable to any deduction, loss, credit or other Tax benefit resulting
from or arising out of such Loss. The Indemnitee shall be deemed to realize,
with respect to any taxable year, a Tax benefit ("Tax Benefit") attributable
to a Loss if, and to the extent that, the Indemnitee's cumulative liability
for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by excluding any
Tax items attributable to the Loss from all taxable years, exceeds the
Indemnitee's cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable
year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items attributable to the Loss
for all taxable years.

 (f) In no event will any party be entitled to recover or make a claim for any
amounts in respect of consequential, incidental or indirect damages, lost
profits or punitive damages and, in particular, no "multiple of profits" or
"multiple of cash flow" or similar valuation methodology shall be used in
calculating the amount of any Losses.

Section 9.11 Trustee Exculpation.

Buyer acknowledges that all trustees, co-trustees, special trustees (or their
designees) (the "Trustees") of the Sellers that are trusts (the "Seller
Trusts"), are executing this Agreement on behalf of such trusts, (b) the
Trustees have executed this Agreement solely as Trustees of the applicable
Seller Trusts in the exercise of the power and authority conferred upon and
vested in such Trustees pursuant to the applicable Seller Trusts, and (c)
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any liability on any
Trustee personally to perform or pay any express or implied covenant,
condition or obligation of any Seller under this Agreement, including any
indemnification obligation. Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of the
Buyer Group (i) expressly waives all such personal liabilities of the
Trustees, and (ii) affirms that it will not assert in any fashion any claim
personally against any Trustee.

ARTICLE 10.

or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an
amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the
time of the amendment.

Section 10.2 Extension.

At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, extend the time for the performance of any of the

Section 10.5 Interpretation.

When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, paragraph,
clause, Exhibit or Disclosure Schedule such reference shall be to an Article,
Section, paragraph, clause, Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. All words used in
this Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number as the
circumstances requires. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit but not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning set forth in this Agreement.
The word "including" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement
will mean "including, without limitation" unless otherwise specified. The
words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is
not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if". The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning
and effect as the word "shall". The words "assets" and "properties" shall be
deemed to have the same meaning, and to refer to all assets and properties,
whether real or personal, tangible or intangible. Any agreement, instrument or
Law defined or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise
specifically indicated. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all
references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money
of the United States of America.

Section 10.6 Disclosure Schedules.

All Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are
hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth
herein. Items referred to in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been "made
available" to Buyer if they have been posted to the Data Room. Neither the
specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty nor the
disclosure of a document or in a schedule comprising part of the Disclosure
Schedules is intended, or shall be construed or offered in any dispute between
the parties as evidence of, the materiality of such dollar amount, document or
information, nor does it establish any standard of materiality upon which to
judge the inclusion or omission of any similar documents or information in
that schedule or any other Disclosure Schedule. The information contained in
this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedules is disclosed solely for the
purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein
shall be deemed to be an admission of any matter whatsoever, including of any
violation of Law or breach of any contract. An exception or qualification set
forth in the Disclosure Schedules with respect to a particular representation
or warranty shall be deemed to be an exception or qualification with respect
to all other applicable representations and warranties to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
is applicable to such other Disclosure Schedule, whether or not such exception
or qualification is so numbered or such other representations and warranties
expressly refer to a schedule.

 Section 10.7 Sellers' Representative.

(a) Appointment. Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints Stephen Polk as the
sole and exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller for all
purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, with full
and exclusive power and authority to act on such Seller's behalf (the
"Sellers' Representative"). The appointment of the Sellers' Representative
hereunder is coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable and shall not be
affected by the death, incapacity, insolvency, bankruptcy, illness or other
inability to act of any Seller. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Sellers' Representative is hereby authorized, on behalf of the
Sellers, in his sole discretion, to:

(i) in connection with the Closing, execute and receive all documents,
instruments, certificates, statements and agreements on behalf of and in the
name of each Seller necessary to effectuate the Closing and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby;

(ii) receive and give all notices and service of process, make all filings,
enter into all contractual obligations, make all decisions, bring, prosecute,
defend, settle, compromise or otherwise resolve all claims, disputes and
Actions, authorize payments in respect of any such claims, disputes or Actions
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby;

(iii) execute and deliver, should it elect to do so in its good faith
discretion, on behalf of Sellers, any amendment to, or waiver of, any term or
provision of this Agreement or any consent, acknowledgment or release relating
to this Agreement; and

(iv) take all other actions permitted or required to be taken by or on behalf
of the Sellers under this Agreement and exercise any and all rights that the
Sellers or the Sellers' Representative are permitted or required to do or
exercise under this Agreement.

(b) Limitation of Liability. The Sellers' Representative shall not be held
liable to any of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates for actions
or omissions in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the power and
authority of the Sellers' Representative pursuant to this Agreement, except in
the case of the Sellers' Representative's gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct. The Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to rely on
the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts that it
reasonably determines to be experienced in the matter at issue, and will not
be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith based on such advice. The Sellers' Representative shall have no
liability to Buyer or the Buyer Group with respect to actions taken or omitted
to be taken in his capacity as the Sellers' Representative.

(c) Reliance on Appointment; Successor Sellers' Representative. Buyer and
members of the Buyer Group may rely on the appointment and authority of the
Sellers' Representative granted pursuant to this Section 10.7. In so doing,
Buyer and members of the Buyer

 Group may rely on any and all actions taken by and decisions of the Sellers'
Representative under this Agreement notwithstanding any dispute or
disagreement among any Seller or the Sellers' Representative with respect to
any such action or decision without any liability to, or obligation to inquire
of, any Seller, the Sellers' Representative or any other Person. Any decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Sellers' Representative shall constitute a
decision of all the Sellers and shall be final and binding upon each Seller.
The Sellers' Representative may resign at any time upon written notice to each
of the Sellers. In the event that the Sellers' Representative resigns or is
otherwise unable to serve, Sellers may remove and designate a successor
Sellers' Representative by a written instrument that is signed in writing by
holders of at least a majority-in-interest of Sellers; provided, that such
successor Sellers' Representative expressly assumes in writing the obligations
of the Sellers' Representative hereunder.

Section 10.8 Entire Agreement.

This Agreement (including the Exhibits, Appendix and Schedules hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior written agreements, arrangements, representations, communications and
understandings and all prior and contemporaneous oral agreements,
arrangements, representations, communications and understandings among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 10.9 Certain Third-Party Beneficiaries.

(a) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person other than the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature under or by reason of this Agreement except as provided in Section
10.14.

(b) Notwithstanding the Section 10.9(a), following the Effective Time, the
provisions of Section 6.10 shall be enforceable as provided therein.

Section 10.10 Governing Law.

This Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Share Purchase and the other transactions contemplated
hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the Laws of any other
jurisdiction that might be applied because of the conflicts of laws principles
of the State of Delaware.

Section 10.11 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers.

(a) Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that
any legal Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Share
Purchase or the other transactions contemplated hereby brought by any party or
its Affiliates against any other party or its Affiliates shall be brought and
determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; provided that if
jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, then any such legal Action may be brought in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court. Each of
the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the

 aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Share Purchase or the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any Action relating thereto
except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than Actions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award
rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the
parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient.

(b) Waivers. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as
described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (c) that (i) the Action in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper, or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

Section 10.12 Assignment; Successors.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under
this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation
of law or otherwise, by any party without the prior written consent of Buyer
(in the case of an assignment by the Sellers) or the Sellers (in the case of
an assignment by Buyer), and any such assignment without such prior written
consent shall be null and void; provided, however, that no assignment shall
limit the assignor's obligations hereunder; provided further that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign its rights under this
Agreement to any wholly owned subsidiary thereof, but no such assignment shall
limit Buyer's obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.13 Specific Performance.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms or otherwise breach such provisions and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for such
damages. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (i) it has an adequate remedy at law, or (ii) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of

 this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

Section 10.14 No Recourse to Lenders.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, each of the Sellers and the
Company agrees on its behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
that (i) none of the lenders, agents or arrangers under the Financing nor
their respective Affiliates, successors or assigns, nor their respective
current, former or future officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives, stockholders, limited partners, managers, members or partners
nor any Person who signs a joinder to the Financing Commitment nor any other
debt financing sources (collectively, the "Lender Related Parties") shall have
any liability or obligation to the Sellers, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Financing, the Financing Commitment or any of the transactions contemplated
herein or therein and (ii) the Lender Related Parties are express third party
beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions set forth in this
Section 10.14, and in Section 10.11 and Section 10.16, all of which shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of the Sellers and the Company.

Section 10.15 Severability.

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as either the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under this Section with
respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 10.16 Waiver of Jury Trial.

EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SHARE PURCHASE OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 10.17 Counterparts.

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall
be considered one and the same instrument and shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other parties. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by
facsimile or other electronic image scan transmission shall be effective as
delivery of an original executed counterpart hereof.

Section 10.18 No Presumption Against Drafting Party.

 Each of Buyer and the Sellers acknowledges that such party has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of Law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the drafting party has no application to the parties hereto
and is expressly waived.
