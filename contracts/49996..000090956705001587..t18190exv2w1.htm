INCO LIMITED, 
 a corporation existing under the laws 
 of Canada,  

  

(hereinafter called the "Offeror"),  

  

 \- and -  

  

FALCONBRIDGE LIMITED, 
 a corporation existing under the laws 
 of the Province of Ontario,  

  

(hereinafter called the "Company").  

  

 WHEREAS the Offeror desires to acquire all of the common shares (the "Common Shares") of the Company not currently owned by it and is prepared to make an offer to acquire such Common Shares; 

  

 AND WHEREAS the board of directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors") has determined, after receiving financial and legal advice, that it would be advisable and in the best interests of the Company for the Board of Directors to support the Offer (as hereinafter defined) and to recommend acceptance of the Offer to holders of Common Shares ("Shareholders") in writing and for the Company to co-operate with the Offeror and to use its reasonable best efforts to permit the Offer to be successful, all on the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein; 

  

 NOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSES that, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by each party, the parties hereby covenant and agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 

   

THE OFFER  

  

1.1 _The Offer_  

   

 (a) The Offeror shall promptly publicly announce its intention to make an offer and, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, either make, or cause a directly or indirectly wholly-owed subsidiary of the Offeror (the "Acquisition Company") to make, either alone, or jointly with the Offeror, an offer (the "Offer") to purchase all outstanding Common Shares (other than those owned directly or indirectly by the Offeror), including Common Shares issuable (and that, prior to the Expiry Time (as defined below) are actually issued) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of any securities of the Company that are convertible into or 

   ##### 

  

  

\- 2 -  

 

exchangeable or exercisable for Common Shares (the "Convertible Securities")
at a price per Common Share of: (i) Cdn. $34.00 in cash; or (ii) 0.6713 of a
common share of the Offeror (the "Offeror Shares") and Cdn. $0.05 in cash, at
the election of the holder thereof, but subject to an aggregate maximum of
Cdn. $2,872,648,913 in cash (the "Cash Maximum") and an aggregate maximum
of 200,702,404 Offeror Shares (the "Share Maximum") in accordance in all
material respects with all applicable securities Laws (as defined in Schedule
B to this Agreement) in Canada and the United States (collectively,
"Securities Laws"). On any take-up of Common Shares the Cash Maximum and
the Share Maximum will be pro rated to the Common Shares taken up on that
date in the same proportion that the number of Common Shares taken up on that
date bears to the total number of Common Shares outstanding on a Fully-
Diluted Basis (as defined below). In the event a Shareholder that is an
eligible Canadian resident receives a combination of cash and Offeror Shares,
at the request of such Shareholder delivered to the Offeror with its tender
of Common Shares, the Offeror will agree to duly and jointly complete with
the Shareholder an election under subsection 85(1) or subsection 85(2) of the
Income Tax Act (Canada) and the corresponding provision of any
applicable provincial tax legislation in respect of the transfer of the
Shareholders Common Shares to the Offeror. The term "Offer" shall include
any amendments to, or extensions of, the Offer made in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, subject to
subsection 1.1(d), removing or waiving any condition or extending the period
during which Common Shares may be deposited. The Offer shall be subject to
the condition that there has been validly deposited under the Offer and not
withdrawn at the Expiry Time such number of Common Shares which, together
with any Common Shares directly or indirectly owned by the Offeror,
constitutes at least 66 2/3% of the Common Shares outstanding at the Expiry
Time (calculated on a Fully-Diluted Basis) (as such condition may be amended
from time to time in accordance with this Agreement, the "Minimum
Tender Condition") and shall be subject to the other conditions described in
Schedule A hereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Fully-Diluted Basis"
means a basis which assumes that the number of Common Shares outstanding is
that number which would be outstanding if all rights to acquire
Common Shares, other than those which are not, and cannot in accordance with
their terms become, exerciseable within 120 days following the Outside Date
(as defined below). 

   

 (b) The Offeror shall mail the Offer and accompanying take-over bid circular (collectively, the "Circular") in accordance in all material respects with applicable Securities Laws to all registered Shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, not later than 11:59 p.m. (Toronto time) on the 20th business day (as defined in Section 7.8 below) following the execution of this Agreement (such time on such date being referred to herein as the "Latest Mailing Time"); provided, however, that if the mailing of the Offer is delayed by reason of: (a) an injunction, order or any other action made or taken by a court or regulatory authority of competent jurisdiction, then, provided that such injunction, order or other action is being contested or appealed by the Offeror, the Latest Mailing Time shall be extended to the earlier of 11:59 p.m. on November 30, 2005 and 11:59 p.m. on the fifth business day following the date on which such injunction, order or other action ceases to be in effect; (b) the Offeror not having obtained any regulatory waiver, consent or approval which is necessary to permit the Offeror to mail the Offer, then, provided that such regulatory waiver, consent or approval is being actively sought, the Latest Mailing Time shall be extended to the earlier of 11:59 p.m. on November 30, 2005 and 11:59 p.m. on the fifth business day following the date on which such waiver, consent 

   ##### 

  

  

\- 3 -  

 

or approval is obtained; (c) the Company not having provided to the Offeror
any information pertaining to the Company that is necessary for the
completion of the Circular by the Offeror, or not having provided the Offeror
with such other assistance in the preparation of the Circular as may be
reasonably requested by the Offeror in order that the Circular comply in all
material respects with applicable Securities Laws, then the Latest Mailing
Time shall be extended to 11:59 p.m. on the fifth business day following the
date on which the Company supplies such necessary information or other
assistance; and (d) any financial statements of the Company and
its predecessors (including financial information relating to the Company and
its predecessors required for the timely preparation of pro forma financial
statements of the Offeror) necessary for inclusion in the Circular not being
available, then provided that the Offeror is diligently pursuing the
preparation of the financial statements to be included in the Circular the
Latest Mailing Time shall be extended to 11:59 p.m. on the tenth business day
following the date on which such financial statements become available. The
Company and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment
upon the Circular prior to mailing, recognizing that whether or not such
comments are appropriate will be determined by the Offeror, acting reasonably.
The Offeror shall not be required to make the Offer in any jurisdiction where
it would be illegal to do so or in any jurisdiction other than Canada and the
United States which would require the Offeror to file a prospectus,
registration statement or other similar document. The Offeror shall file
the Circular and any other documents required by the Securities Laws in
connection with the Offer with applicable securities regulatory authorities
within the times and in the manner required by the Securities Laws. 

   

 (c) The Offer shall expire not earlier than 8:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the 60th day (the "Initial Expiry Time") after the date that the Offer is first commenced within the meaning of the _Securities Act_ (Ontario) (the "Commencement Date"), subject to the right of the Offeror to extend from time to time the period during which Common Shares may be deposited under the Offer (such Initial Expiry Time or any extension thereof, the "Expiry Time") if the Minimum Tender Condition or any other condition to the Offer is not satisfied or waived at the Expiry Time. If the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of Schedule A to this Agreement (the "Competition Clearance Conditions") have not been satisfied or waived by the Initial Expiry Time, the Offeror agrees that it will extend the Offer through one or more extensions for such number of days as does not exceed the lesser of: (i) an additional 60 days; and (ii) such number of days as is required for the Competition Clearance Conditions to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any other Person makes an offer to acquire the Common Shares by take-over bid which other offer has a stated expiry time that is earlier than the Initial Expiry Time, the Offeror may amend or vary the Offer to accelerate the Initial Expiry Time. For greater certainty, the provisions of Section 1.2 of this Agreement shall continue to apply to the Offer, notwithstanding an acceleration of the Initial Expiry Time made in accordance with the foregoing sentence. 

  

 (d) It is understood and agreed that the Offeror may, in its sole discretion, modify or waive any term or condition of the Offer; provided that the Offeror shall not, without the prior consent of the Company, increase the Minimum Tender Condition, impose additional conditions to the Offer or otherwise vary the Offer (or any terms or conditions thereof) in a manner which is adverse to the Shareholders (provided that, for certainty, the Offeror may in its sole discretion 

   ##### 

  

  

\- 4 -  

 

waive or decrease the Minimum Tender Condition (provided that it may not waive
the Minimum Tender Condition in order to acquire less than 50.01% of the
Common Shares outstanding (calculated on a Fully-Diluted Basis)), increase
the total consideration per Common Share and/or add additional consideration,
or accelerate the Initial Expiry Time in accordance with Section 1.1(c)
above). 

   

 (e) The obligation of the Offeror to make, or cause the Acquisition Company to make, the Offer is conditional on the prior satisfaction of the following conditions, all of which conditions are included for the sole benefit of the Offeror and the Acquisition Company and any or all of which may be waived by the Offeror and the Acquisition Company in whole or in part in its sole discretion without prejudice to any other right it may have under this Agreement and which shall be deemed to have been waived by the making of the Offer: 

  

       | (i)  |   | the obligations of the Offeror hereunder shall
not have been terminated pursuant to Section 6.1;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | no circumstance, fact, change, event or occurrence
caused by an individual, general partnership, limited partnership,
corporation, company, limited liability company, unincorporated association,
unincorporated syndicate, unincorporated organization, trust, trustee,
executor, administrator or other legal representative (a "Person") other than
the Offeror, an Affiliate (as defined below) of the Offeror or any Person
acting jointly or in concert with the Offeror, shall have occurred that would
render it impossible for the Minimum Tender Condition or one or more of the
conditions set out on Schedule A hereto to be satisfied;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | the Offeror shall have received all waivers, rulings
or orders necessary for the making of the Offer or to mail to the
Shareholders the Circular from all applicable securities commissions or other
regulatory authorities;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | the Offeror Shares shall have been conditionally
approved for listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSX") and the
Offeror has not been advised that the Offeror Shares would not be approved
for listing, subject to notice of issuance, by the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE");  
      
    | (v)  |   | the Board of Directors shall have unanimously
recommended that all Shareholders accept the Offer and shall not have
withdrawn such recommendation or changed, modified or qualified such
recommendation in a manner adverse to the Offeror, or taken any other action
or made any other public statement in connection with the Offer inconsistent
with such recommendation;  
      
    | (vi)  |   | the Company shall have complied in all respects with
its covenants in Section 5.2 and in all material respects with its other
covenants in this Agreement;

\- 5 -  

  

       | (vii)  |   | all representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Section 1.2 and Schedule C shall be true and correct in
all respects at the time of the making of the Offer; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (viii)  |   | no cease trade order, injunction or other
prohibition at law shall exist against the Offeror making the Offer or taking
up or paying for Common Shares deposited under the Offer.  
   

  

1.2 _Company Approval of the Offer_  

   

 (a) The Company represents and warrants to and in favour of the Offeror and acknowledges that the Offeror is relying upon such representations and warranties in entering into this Agreement, that, as of the date hereof: 

  

       | (i)  |   | CIBC World Markets Inc. has delivered an oral
opinion to the Board of Directors to the effect that the consideration to be
received under the Offer is fair from a financial point of view to all

    | (ii)  |   | the Board of Directors, upon consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, has unanimously determined that the price
offered under the Offer is fair from a financial point of view to all
Shareholders (other than the Offeror) and that it is in the best interests of
the Company for the Offer to be made and the Board of Directors to support it
and, accordingly, has unanimously approved the entering into of this
Agreement and the making of a recommendation that Shareholders (other than
the Offeror) accept the Offer. Each member of the Board of Directors has
agreed to support the Offer and has agreed that the press release to be
issued by the Offeror announcing the Offer may so state and that references
to such agreement may be made in the Circular and other documents relating to
the Offer; provided, however, that references herein to the unanimous
determination and approval of the Board of Directors and to the agreement of
each of the Directors shall not include Directors who have declared a
conflict of interest and have not participated in any consideration of the
Offer;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | the Company is a "foreign private issuer", as defined

end of the Companys last quarter or, if such quarter terminated within 60
days of the date hereof, as of the end of the Companys preceding quarter,
and as of the date hereof, by any Person whose address appears on the records
of the Company, any voting trustee, any depositary, any share transfer agent
or

       |   |   | any Person acting in a similar capacity on behalf
of the Company as being located in the United States. In addition, (A) the
aggregate trading volume of the Common Shares on the TSX exceeded the
aggregate trading volume of the Common Shares on the NYSE over the most
recent 12-calendar-month period, (B) the most recent annual report or annual

of Ontario or with the SEC does not indicate that U.S. holders hold 25% or
more of the Common Shares, and (C) the Company has no actual knowledge that
the level of U.S. ownership of the Common Shares equals or exceeds 25% of the
Common Shares.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 (b) The Company shall prepare and make available for distribution contemporaneously and together with the Circular, in both the English and French languages as circumstances may require, sufficient copies of a directors circular relating to the Offer (the "Directors Circular"), prepared in all material respects in accordance with all applicable Securities Laws, which shall reflect the foregoing determinations and recommendation, and the Company shall take all other reasonable action to support the Offer. Prior to printing the Directors Circular, the Company shall provide the Offeror with an opportunity to review and comment on it, recognizing that whether or not such comments are appropriate will be determined by the Company, acting reasonably. The Company shall file the Directors Circular and any other documents required by all applicable Securities Laws in connection with the Directors Circular with applicable securities regulatory authorities within the times and in the manner required by all applicable Securities Laws. 

  

 (c) The Company shall provide the Offeror, within two business days of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with a list of the registered holders of Common Shares and Convertible Securities and a list of participants in book based nominee registrants such as CDS and Co. and CEDE and Co. as may be made available to the Company upon request, together with their addresses and respective holdings of Common Shares and Convertible Securities. The Company shall concurrently provide the Offeror with the names, addresses and holdings of all Persons having rights to acquire Common Shares or Convertible Securities and the details of such rights. The Company shall from time to time promptly furnish the Offeror with such additional information, including updated or additional lists of Shareholders or holders of Convertible Securities, mailing labels and lists of securities positions and other assistance as the Offeror may reasonably request in order to be able to communicate the Offer to the Shareholders and to such other Persons as are entitled to receive the Offer under applicable Securities Laws. 

  

 (d) The Company agrees that if the Offer is not, or ceases to qualify as, a "Permitted Bid" under the Companys shareholder rights plan dated as of September 22, 2005 (the "Rights Plan"), the Company will immediately defer the separation time of the Rights (as defined in the Rights Plan) in respect of the Offer and to continue to defer separation of the Rights with respect to the Offer. The Company agrees that, immediately prior to the Expiry Time, it shall waive or suspend the operation of or otherwise render the Rights Plan inoperative against the Offer, any Compulsory Acquisition (as defined in Section 1.6) and any Subsequent Acquisition Transaction (as defined in Section 1.6). Subject to the foregoing, unless required by the terms of the Rights 

   ##### 

  

  

\- 7 -  

 

Plan with respect to a competing take-over or a final and non-appealable order
of a court having jurisdiction or an order of the Ontario Securities
Commission, the Company shall not redeem the Rights or otherwise waive,
amend, suspend the operation of or terminate the Rights Plan without the
prior written consent of the Offeror. 

   

 (e) Provided that the Offeror has acquired not less than 50.01% of the outstanding Common Shares (on a Fully-Diluted Basis) no later than 10 days after the Expiry Time, the Company agrees that it will, at the request of the Offeror, promptly take all necessary steps to redeem all of its outstanding Junior Preference Shares (Series 1, 2 and 3) and any other class of preference shares, or any outstanding convertible debentures. Such redemption shall be completed by the Company prior to the effective date of any Subsequent Acquisition Transaction announced by the Offeror. 

  

1.3 _Consent Under Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement_  

   

 The Company consents, pursuant to the provisions of Section 13 of the confidentiality and standstill agreement dated September 13, 2005 between the Offeror and the Company relating to the provision of confidential information by the Company to the Offeror (the "Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement"), to the making of the Offer and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein (collectively, the "Contemplated Transactions", which include the Offer, any Compulsory Acquisition, any Subsequent Acquisition Transaction or any subsequent amalgamation of the Offeror and the Company). The Company and the Offeror further agree that the provisions of Section 13 of the Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement cease to apply to the Offeror in their entirety provided that the provisions of the Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement shall once again apply to the Offeror if: (i) the Offer has expired and the Offeror has not acquired any Common Shares pursuant to the Offer; and (ii) each Competing Proposal which has been made prior to the expiry of the Offer has been withdrawn or otherwise terminated. 

  

1.4 _Outstanding Stock Options_  

   

 Subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, and the consent of the Offeror, acting reasonably, the Company may make such amendments to the Companys stock option plan (the "Stock Option Plan"), if any, as may be necessary, and take all such other steps as may be necessary or desirable, to allow all Persons holding options pursuant to the Stock Option Plan to become holders of options to acquire Offeror Shares in connection with the assumption of the Stock Option Plan by the Offeror upon the completion of a Contemplated Transaction. The options to acquire Offeror Shares shall be on the same terms and conditions as the currently outstanding options to acquire Common Shares of the Company held by such persons, including with respect to vesting schedules, expiry dates and exercise prices, except that each option to acquire one Common Share of the Company shall become an option to acquire 0.6723 Offeror Share(s) and have an exercise price per Offeror Share equal to the exercise price per Common Share of that option immediately prior to the Expiry Time divided by 0.6723. The Company shall not accelerate or take any action to facilitate acceleration (other than in accordance with the vesting terms originally granted and other than pursuant to commitments in respect of options in respect of no more than 3,171,754 shares made prior to the date hereof) of 

   ##### 

  

  

\- 8 -  

 

the vesting of any outstanding options under the Stock Option Plan; provided,
however, if the employment of any employee is terminated without cause within
one year of the Expiry Time, the Offeror and/or the Company shall take such
action as may be necessary to vest any unvested options granted under the
Stock Option Plan to such employee and to permit the exercise of such options
for a period of not less than 30 days following such termination. The Company
may take action to facilitate the tender to the Offer of the Common Shares
underlying vested stock options and, in particular, may allow the conditional
exercise of any outstanding vested options. 

   

1.5 _Directors and Officers_  

   

 Promptly upon the purchase by the Offeror of such number of Common Shares as represents at least a majority of the then outstanding Common Shares (the "Effective Date") and from time to time thereafter, the Company acknowledges that the Offeror shall be entitled (subject to the existing rights of the holders of the Companys Junior Preference Shares) to designate such number of members of the Board of Directors, and any committees thereof, as is proportionate to the percentage of the outstanding Common Shares owned by the Offeror and the Company shall not frustrate the Offerors attempts to do so and covenants to co-operate with the Offeror, subject to all applicable Laws, to enable the Offerors designees to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors and to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors, including, without limitation, at the request of the Offeror, by its reasonable best efforts to expand the Board of Directors and/or secure the resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to enable the Offerors designees to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors. 

  

1.6 _Subsequent Acquisition Transaction_  

   

 If, within 120 days after the date of the Offer, the Offer has been accepted by holders of not less than 90% of the outstanding Common Shares as at the Expiry Time, excluding Common Shares held by the Offeror, or an "Affiliate" or an "Associate" (as those terms are defined in the _Securities Act_ (Ontario)) of the Offeror, the Offeror or the Acquisition Company may at its option acquire (a "Compulsory Acquisition") the remainder of the Common Shares from those Shareholders who have not accepted the Offer pursuant to Section 188 of the _Business Corporations Act_ (Ontario) (the "OBCA"). If that statutory right of acquisition is not available, or the Offeror does not exercise such right, the Offeror intends to pursue other means of acquiring the remaining Common Shares not tendered to the Offer, although the Offeror shall not be under any obligation to do so. The Company agrees that, in the event the Offeror takes up and pays for Common Shares under the Offer representing at least a simple majority of the outstanding Common Shares (calculated on a Fully-Diluted Basis as at the Expiry Time), it will assist the Offeror in connection with any proposed amalgamation, statutory arrangement, amendment to articles, consolidation, capital reorganization or other transaction involving the Company and the Offeror or an Affiliate of the Offeror that the Offeror may, in its sole discretion, undertake to pursue (a "Subsequent Acquisition Transaction") to acquire the remaining Common Shares and to achieve an amalgamation of the Company and the Offeror, provided that the consideration per Common Share offered in connection with the Subsequent Acquisition Transaction is at least equivalent in value to the consideration per Common Share offered under the Offer, and further provided that for this purpose, in calculating the value of the 

   ##### 

  

  

\- 9 -  

 

consideration offered in any Subsequent Acquisition Transaction, each
Offerors Share shall be deemed to be at least equivalent in value to each
Offerors Share offered under the Offer. 

   

1.7 _Pre Take-Up Transactions_  

   

 (a) _Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations_. The Company shall, following the Commencement Date, effect such reorganizations of its business, operations and assets or such other transactions as the Offeror may request, acting reasonably (each such reorganization, a "Pre-Acquisition Reorganization"). The Offeror shall provide written notice to the Company of any proposed Pre-Acquisition Reorganization at least 10 business days prior to the Expiry Time. Upon receipt of such notice, the Offeror and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare prior to the Expiry Time all documentation necessary to give effect to each such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization as directed by the Offeror. The completion of any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Offeror of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Schedule A hereto and shall be effected immediately prior to the take up of the Common Shares tendered to the Offer by the Offeror (such date to be no earlier than the Expiry Time) or at such time thereafter as directed by the Offeror. 

  

 (b) _Subco Reorganization_. Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall take all necessary steps to prepare to effect as of, at, or as promptly as practicable following the Expiry Time as the Offeror may reasonably direct, such reorganization of its business, operations and assets as may be required to prepare a subsidiary ("Subco") holding the Companys Nikkelverk, Norway refinery and the Companys marketing organizations for the products currently produced at such refinery (the "Identified Assets") as the Offeror may reasonably direct for each of: (i) a possible sale of the shares, or all or substantially all of the assets, of Subco to a third party (a "Subco Third Party Sale"), (ii) a possible sale of Subco shares to the public (a "Subco Public Offering"); (iii) a possible distribution of Subco shares to shareholders of the Offeror (a "Subco Spin") (such reorganization, the "Subco Reorganization"); and the creation of a new agreement, to be effective as of the date of the Subco Reorganization but no earlier than the Expiry Time, covering the supply of one or more forms of intermediate products to the refinery referred to above, the terms and conditions of which agreement shall be as directed by the Offeror. 

  

 (c) _Subco Third Party Sale_. The Company shall, if requested by the Offeror, conduct an auction process in respect of a Subco Third Party Sale in such manner as the Offeror shall direct. If so directed by the Offeror, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to enter into a binding agreement to sell Subco to a third party on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Offeror, which agreement shall be effective, unless the Offeror has advised the Company of a later date for such condition, upon the Offeror acquiring a majority of the outstanding Common Shares. 

  

 (d) _Subco Public Offering and Subco Spin_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make all necessary preparations to effect the Subco Public Offering and the Subco Spin, in each case in such manner as the Offeror may direct.

 (e) _Filings_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall, at and in accordance with the directions of the Offeror:

promptly to prepare and file, as applicable all forms, statements, reports
and documents, required to be filed or furnished by it with the securities
regulatory authorities and stock exchanges in jurisdictions selected by
the Offeror including any prospectus or other documents necessary to effect
the Subco Public Offering or Subco Spin, to cause Subco to become a reporting
issuer or registrant in each jurisdiction selected by the Offeror and to have
its shares listed on the stock exchange(s) selected by the Offeror (the
"Subco Filings");  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | use reasonable best efforts to have the Subco Filings
approved or declared effective by the applicable regulatory authorities
(including the issuance of a final receipt for any Subco prospectus) and by
the stock exchange(s) selected by the Offeror; and  
      
    | (iii)  |   | use reasonable best efforts, and cause its
Subsidiaries (including Subco) to use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause any shares of Subco that are distributed to the public or to
shareholders of the Offeror in connection with a Subco Public Offering or a
Subco Spin, respectively, to be approved for listing on the stock exchange(s)
selected by the Offeror, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to
such distribution.  
   

  

 (f) _Accuracy of Information_. The Company agrees, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries (including Subco), that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Subco Filing will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 (g) _Compliance with Securities Laws_. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries (including Subco) to, cause all Subco Filings to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of applicable securities laws and the requirements of the stock exchange(s) selected by the Offeror, as applicable. 

  

 (h) _Auditors  Consents and Comfort Letters_. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries (including Subco) to, use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered: (A) to the Offeror, any consents of its independent auditors reasonably requested by the Offeror under all applicable Securities Laws, including consents to the incorporation by reference of the reports of such auditors on the financial statements of the Company and its predecessors into the Circular filed with the SEC under cover of Form F-8; and (B) to the Offeror and its directors, a letter of the Companys or such Subsidiarys independent auditors, dated the date on which any Subco Filings shall be made with the SEC or Canadian securities regulatory authorities and addressed to the Offeror and its directors, in form and substance customary for "comfort" letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with forms, statements, reports and documents required to be filed with the SEC and Canadian securities regulatory authorities.

 (e) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after it has received any proposal, inquiry, offer or request) notify the Offeror, at first orally and then in writing, of any proposal, inquiry, offer (or any amendment thereto) or request relating to or constituting an Acquisition Proposal, any request for discussions or negotiations, any request for representation on the Board of Directors and or any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any Subsidiary or any material joint venture or material mineral property of which the Companys directors, officers, representatives or agents are or became aware, or any amendments to the foregoing. Such notice shall include a description of the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, any proposal, inquiry, offer (including any amendment thereto) or request, and shall include copies of any such proposal, inquiry, offer or request or any amendment to any of the foregoing. The Company shall also provide such other details of the proposal, inquiry, offer or request, or any amendment to any of the foregoing, as the Offeror may reasonably request. The Company shall keep the Offeror promptly and fully informed of the status, including any change to the material terms, of any such proposal, inquiry, offer or request, or any amendment to any of the foregoing, and will respond promptly to all inquiries by the Offeror with respect thereto.

 (f) The Company shall ensure that its officers, directors, representatives and agents, and its Subsidiaries and their officers, directors, representatives and agents, are aware of the provisions of Sections 5.2(b) to 5.2(e) hereof and agree to be bound thereby, and it shall be responsible for any breach of such provisions by any of them or by any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary. 

  

 (g) The Company shall not accept, approve or recommend, nor enter into any agreement relating to, an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement contemplated by Section 5.2(c)(D) above) unless: 

  

       | (i)  |   | the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the Company has complied with Sections 5.2(b) through
5.2(h), inclusive;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | the Company has provided the Offeror with notice in
writing that there is a Superior Proposal together with all documentation
related to and detailing the Superior Proposal (including a copy of the
confidentiality agreement between the Company and the Person making the
Superior Proposal if not previously delivered) at least seven business days
prior to the date on which the Board of Directors proposes to accept,
approve, recommend or to enter into any agreement relating to such Superior
Proposal;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | seven business days shall have elapsed from the later
of the date the Offeror received notice of the Companys proposed
determination to accept, approve, recommend or to enter into any agreement
relating to such Superior Proposal, and the date the Offeror received a copy
of the written proposal in respect of the Acquisition Proposal and, if the
Offeror has proposed to amend the terms of the Offer in accordance with
Section 5.2(h), the Board of Directors (after receiving advice from its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) shall have determined in good
faith that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal compared to the
proposed amendment to the terms of the Offer by the Offeror;  
      
    | (v)  |   | the Company concurrently terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.1(k); and  
      
    | (vi)  |   | the Company has previously, or concurrently will have,
paid to the Offeror the Company Termination Payment.  
   

  

 (h) The Company acknowledges and agrees that, during the seven business day period referred to in Section 5.2(g)(iv) or such longer period as the Company may approve for such purpose, the Offeror shall have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of the Offer. The Board of Directors will review any proposal by the Offeror to amend the terms of the Offer in order to determine, in good faith in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, whether the Offerors proposal to amend the Offer would result in the Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of the Offer. 

   ##### 

  

  

\- 23 -  

 

The Board of Directors shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Offer
by press release after: (x) any Acquisition Proposal (which is determined not
to be a Superior Proposal) is publicly announced or made; or (y) the Board of
Directors determines that a proposed amendment to the terms of the Offer
would result in the Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal, and
the Offeror has so amended the terms of the Offer. The Offeror and its
counsel and other advisors shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the form and content of any such press release. 

  

Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors from responding
through a directors circular or otherwise as required by applicable
Securities Laws to an Acquisition Proposal that it determines is not a
Superior Proposal. 

  

The Company also acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification of
any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 5.2.

       |   |   | Offeror which has occurred since the date hereof;
(B) the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after receipt of
advice from its legal and financial advisors) that: (x) a Material Adverse
Change in the Offeror has occurred since the date hereof; and (y) the failure
to change the Boards recommendation, or refusal to reaffirm such
recommendation, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; and (C) the
Offeror has filed, or the Ontario Securities Commission has determined that
it should have filed, a Material Change Report in accordance with applicable
Securities Laws in respect of such Material Adverse Change;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
6.1(h) as a result of the Company being in default of any of its covenants or
obligations contained in Section 5.2 of this Agreement; or  
      
    | (iii)  |   | (A) prior to the termination of this Agreement a
Competing Proposal is publicly announced or otherwise made; and (B) during
the period commencing on the date hereof and ending 12 months following the
termination of this Agreement (X) a Competing Proposal is consummated, or (Y)
the Board of Directors approves or recommends a Competing Proposal, or the

Proposal, and that Competing Proposal is subsequently consummated at any time

Such payment shall be due: (A) in the case of a termination specified in
clause (i) or (ii) above, forthwith (and in any event within two business
days) following the termination of this Agreement but prior to or
concurrently with termination in the case of a termination pursuant to

 (c) The Company shall forthwith pay the Company Expense Payment to the Offeror by way of a wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by the Offeror if this Agreement is terminated in the circumstances set out in Section 6.1(h). 

  

 (d) The Company shall forthwith pay the Offeror Enhanced Expense Payment to the Offeror by way of a wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by the Offeror if the Offer is not completed as a result of the Minimum Tender Condition not having been satisfied in circumstances in which either the U.S./EC/Cdn. Clearances have been obtained or such U.S./EC/Cdn. Clearances have not been obtained and the Company has not complied with its covenants and obligations in Sections 1.7 and 5.1 (in either case, whether or not any other conditions of the Offer are also not satisfied) and this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1(d) unless: (A) the non-satisfaction of the Minimum Tender Condition arises solely as a result of a Material Adverse Change in respect of the Offeror which has occurred since the date hereof; (B) the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after receipt of advice from its legal and financial advisors) that: (x) a Material Adverse Change in the Offeror has occurred since the date hereof; and (y) the failure to change the Boards recommendation, or refusal to reaffirm such recommendation, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; and (C) the 

   ##### 

  

  

\- 25 -  

 

Offeror has filed, or the Ontario Securities Commission has determined that it
should have filed, a Material Change Report in accordance with applicable
Securities Laws in respect of such Material Adverse Change. 

   

 Moreover, in circumstances in which the Offeror Enhanced Expense Payment is payable under this Section 5.3(d), if within 18 months of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d) a Competing Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall, prior to or concurrently with the consummation of a Competing Proposal, pay to the Offeror the Offeror Termination Payment (less the amount of the Offeror Enhanced Expense Payment provided such latter amount has been paid to the Offeror). 

  

 (e) The Offeror shall forthwith pay the Offeror Expense Payment to the Company by way of a wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by the Company if this Agreement is terminated in the circumstances set out in Section 6.1(g). 

  

 (f) The Company acknowledges that the amount set out in this Section 5.3 in respect of the Company Termination Payment represents liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages, including opportunity costs, which the Offeror will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and resultant termination of this Agreement, and is not a penalty. The Company irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. 

  

5.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_  

   

 Each party shall give prompt notice to the other of any failure of such party, or any officer, director, employee, representative or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. 

  

5.5 _Investigation_  

   

 Upon reasonable notice and subject to the Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement, the Company agrees to continue to provide the Offeror and its representatives with reasonable access (without disruption to the conduct of the Companys business) during normal business hours to all books, records, information and files in its possession and control and access to its personnel on an as reasonably requested basis as well as reasonable access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries in order to allow the Offeror to continue to conduct such investigations as the Offeror may consider necessary or advisable for strategic planning, the structuring of the Subco Reorganization and any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization and other reasons related to the combination of the Company and the Offeror, and further agrees to assist the Offeror in all reasonable ways in any investigations which the Offeror may wish to conduct. Nothing in the foregoing shall require the Company to disclose information which it is prohibited from disclosing pursuant to a written confidentiality agreement or confidentiality provision of an agreement with third parties, or information which, in the opinion of the Company, acting reasonably, is competitively sensitive provided that, the Company accepts that the Offeror may have access to such sensitive information in connection with obtaining U.S./EC/Cdn. Clearances and creating Subco. Offeror will, subject to the Confidentiality and 

   ##### 

  

  

\- 26 -  

 

Standstill Agreement dated September 13, 2005 between it and the Company under
which the Offeror agreed to make available Confidential Information (as
defined therein) to the Company, make available information relating to the
Offeror and its business and operations to assist the Company in its
evaluation and work relating to the integration plan for the parties to be
implemented upon the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Any
investigation by a party hereto and its advisors shall not mitigate, diminish
or affect the representations and warranties of the other party contained in
this Agreement or any document or certificate given pursuant hereto.
For greater certainty, until the earlier of the Effective Date and the
termination of this Agreement, access to and exchange of competitively
sensitive confidential information ("Confidential Data") as between the
Offeror and the Company shall be limited to that which is reasonably necessary
for the purposes of securing the US/EC/Cdn. Clearances and the Other
Clearances, the preparation and settlement of definitive documents and the
advancement of the Offer as contemplated herein and shall be further limited
such that the dissemination of such Confidential Data shall be confined
to those representatives of the Offeror and the Company and their advisors
who have a need to know such information for these purposes and who agree to
respect such confidentiality in their dealings with such Confidential Data.
In particular, with reference to access to and the sharing of Confidential
Data of one party with representatives of the other party for the purposes
of preparing any filings or submissions under the Canadian Competition Act,
the EC Merger Regulation and the HSR Act in respect of the Offer, the general
principle which shall be applied is that such information shall be made
available to, exchanged or shared with counsel to the parties rather than the
parties or their representatives. 

   

5.6 _Shareholder Claims_  

   

 The Company shall not settle or compromise, or agree to settle or compromise, any claim brought by any present, former or purported holder of any securities of the Company in connection with the Contemplated Transactions prior to the Effective Date without the prior written consent of the Offeror. 

  

5.7 _Officers  and Directors Insurance_ 

   

 From and after the Effective Date, the Offeror agrees that for the period from the Expiry Time until six years after the Expiry Time, the Offeror will cause the Company or any successor to the Company to maintain the Companys current directors and officers insurance policy or a policy reasonably equivalent subject in either case to terms and conditions no less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company than those contained in the policy in effect on the date hereof ("Equivalent Insurance"), for all present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, covering claims made prior to or within six years after the Expiry Time; provided that such insurance remains available to the Company or such successor on commercially reasonable terms. Alternatively, the Offeror may purchase as an extension to the Companys current insurance policies, pre-paid non-cancellable run-off directors and officers liability insurance providing such coverage for such persons on terms comparable to those contained in the Companys current insurance policies. From and after the Effective Date, the Offeror shall, and shall cause the Company (or its successor) to, indemnify the current and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the fullest 

   ##### 

  

  

\- 27 -  

 

extent to which the Offeror and the Company are permitted to indemnify such
officers and directors under their respective charter, by-laws, applicable
Law and contracts of indemnity. 

   

5.8 _Alternative Transaction_  

   

 The Company agrees to co-operate in good faith with the Offeror and to take all reasonable steps and actions to assist the Offeror to complete any Contemplated Transaction as promptly as practicable. In addition, in the event that the Offeror concludes that it is necessary or desirable to proceed with another form of transaction (such as a plan of arrangement or amalgamation) whereby the Offeror or its Affiliates would effectively acquire all of the Common Shares within the same time periods and on economic terms (including, without limitation, tax treatment) having consequences to the Shareholders which are equivalent to or better than those contemplated by this Agreement (an "Alternative Transaction"), the Company agrees to support the completion of such Alternative Transaction in the same manner as the Offer and shall otherwise fulfill its covenants contained in this Agreement in respect of such Alternative Transaction.

   ##### 

  

  

\- 28 -  

  

 (f) by the Offeror, if: (i) any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any Contemplated Transactions (unless such order, decree or ruling has been withdrawn, reversed or otherwise made inapplicable); or (ii) any litigation or other proceeding is pending or has been threatened to be instituted by any Person or governmental authority, which, in the good faith judgment of the Offeror, could reasonably be expected to result in a decision, order, decree or ruling which enjoins, prohibits, grants damages in a material amount in respect of, or materially impairs the benefits of, any Contemplated Transactions; 

  

 (g) by the Company, if the Offeror is in default of any covenants or obligations under this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of the Offeror under this Agreement shall have been at the date hereof untrue or incorrect or shall have become untrue or incorrect at any time prior to the Expiry Time and such default or inaccuracy is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by the earlier of such date which is 30 days from the date of notice of such breach and the Expiry Time; 

  

 (h) by the Offeror, if the Company is in default of any covenants or obligations under this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of the Company under this Agreement shall have been at the date hereof untrue or incorrect or shall have become untrue or incorrect at any time prior to the Expiry Time and such default or inaccuracy is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by the earlier of such date which is within 30 days from the date of notice of such breach; 

  

 (i) by the Offeror, if: (i) the Board of Directors or any committee thereof fails to recommend or withdraws, modifies, changes or qualifies its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Offer in any manner adverse to the Offeror; (ii) the Board of Directors or any committee thereof recommends or approves, or publicly proposes to recommend or approve, an Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) the Company fails to take any action required under Section 1.2(d) of this Agreement with respect to the Rights Plan to defer the separation time of the Rights or to allow the timely completion of any Contemplated Transaction; 

  

 (j) by the Offeror, if the Board of Directors or any committee thereof fails to publicly affirm its approval or recommendation of the Offer within five calendar days of any written request to do so from the Offeror; and 

  

 (k) by the Company, if the Company proposes to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in compliance with the provisions of Section 5.2(g), provided that the Company has previously or concurrently will have paid to the Offeror the applicable Company Termination Payment and further provided that the Company has not breached any of its covenants, agreements or obligations in this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

  

\- 29 -  

  

6.3 _Waiver_  

   

 At any time prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1, any party hereto may: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party hereto; or (b) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the other party or with any conditions to its own obligations, in each case only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions are intended for its benefit. 

  

6.4 _Effect of Termination_  

   

 For greater certainty, the parties agree that the compensation or damages to be received pursuant to Section 5.3 of this Agreement is the sole remedy in compensation or damages of the party receiving such payment; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 6.4, and no payment of an amount under Section 5.3 of this Agreement, shall relieve or have the effect of relieving any party in any way from liability for damages incurred or suffered by a party as a result of an intentional or wilful breach of this Agreement, including the intentional or wilful making of a misrepresentation in this Agreement (including the Schedules hereto). Nothing herein shall preclude a party from seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any such covenants or agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith.

matters covered in earlier filings) in any document filed by or on behalf of
the Company with any securities regulatory authority in Canada or
elsewhere which the Offeror shall have determined in its reasonable judgment
constitutes a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or which,

expected to constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Offeror;

the Company to purchase any securities of the Company as a result of the
Offer or a Contemplated Transaction, and does not and will not adversely
affect the Offer or the Offeror, either before or on consummation of the
Offer, or the acquisition by the Offeror of any Common Shares under the Offer
or any Compulsory Acquisition or Subsequent Acquisition Transaction.

The failure by the Offeror at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed to be a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed to be an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.  #####

Statements" shall mean: (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of
the Offeror (including any related notes thereto) for the fiscal years ended

Such Offeror Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects,

       | (p)  |   | _Tax Matters_.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | All material reports, information statements and
returns ("Returns") relating to, or required to be filed in connection with,

material joint venture of the Offeror, or any of their respective assets,
except where such  ##### 

 

 

\- B9 -  

       |   |   | deficiencies, actions or proceedings are not
material to the Offeror, such Subsidiary or such material joint venture.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (q)  |   | _Compliance with Laws_ _._ The Offeror, its
Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures have complied with and are not
in violation of any applicable Laws, other than non-compliance or violations
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Offeror, or which would
not materially impair the ability of the Offeror to perform its obligations
hereunder or reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Offer, any Compulsory Acquisition or any subsequent
amalgamation of the Offeror and the Company.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (r)  |   | _Licences, Etc._ The Offeror, each Subsidiary and each
material joint venture owns, possesses, or has obtained and is in compliance
with, all licences, permits, certificates, orders, grants and other
authorizations of or from any governmental authority necessary to conduct its
businesses substantially as now conducted or as proposed to be conducted
except for where failure to do so would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Offeror, or would not reasonably be expected to materially
impair the ability of the Offeror to perform its obligations hereunder or
prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the Contemplated
Transactions.  
      
    | (s)  |   | _Insurance._ Policies of insurance in force as of the
date hereof naming the Offeror as an insured adequately cover all risks
reasonably and prudently foreseeable in the operation and conduct of the
business of the Offeror, its Subsidiaries and material joint ventures for
which, having regard to the nature of such risk and the relative cost of
obtaining insurance, it is in the opinion of the Offeror reasonable to seek
such insurance rather than provide for self insurance. All such policies
of insurance shall remain in force and effect (subject to taking into account
insurance market conditions and offerings and industry practices) and shall
not be cancelled or otherwise terminated as a result of any of the
Contemplated Transactions other than such cancellations as would not
individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect with respect
to the Offeror or such cancellations as have been Disclosed to the Company.  
      
    | (t)  |   | _Environmental_. All operations of the Offeror, its
Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures have been and are now in
compliance with all applicable Laws, including applicable common laws,
relating to the protection of the environment and employee and public health
and safety ("Environmental Laws"), except where the failure to be in
compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Offeror. Except as Disclosed
Publicly, or except for those with respect to which adequate provision in
accordance with Canadian GAAP has been made on the Offerors financial  ##### 

 

 

\- B10 -  

       |   |   | statements, neither the Offeror nor any of
its Subsidiaries or material joint ventures is subject to:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | any proceeding, application, order or directive
which relates to environmental, health or safety matters, and which may
require any material work, repairs, construction or expenditures; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | any demand or notice with respect to any Environmental
Laws applicable to the Offeror, any Subsidiary or any material joint
venture including, without limitation, any regulations respecting the use,
storage, treatment, transportation or disposition of any pollutant,
contaminant, waste of any nature, hazardous substance, hazardous material,
toxic substance, dangerous substance or dangerous good as defined, judicially
interpreted or identified in any Environmental Law;  
   

  

       |   |   | which, in each case, individually or in the
aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Offeror.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (u)  |   | _Property and Title._ Applying customary standards in
the Canadian mining industry, each of the Offeror, its Subsidiaries and its
material joint ventures has sufficient title, clear of any title defect or
Encumbrance (other than as Disclosed Publicly) to its operating properties
and properties with estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and/or
estimated mineral resources (other than property to which it is lessee, in
which case it has a valid leasehold interest) and has good and
sufficient title to the real property interests including, without
limitation, fee simple estate of and in real property, leases, easements,
rights of way, permits or licences from landowners or authorities permitting
the use of land by the Offeror, its Subsidiaries and its material joint
ventures necessary to permit the operation of their respective businesses as
presently owned and conducted. The Offeror, its Subsidiaries and its material
joint ventures hold all mineral rights required to continue their
respective business and operations as currently conducted and as proposed to
be conducted as Disclosed Publicly, except to the extent that a failure to do
so would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Offeror. All mineral rights held by the Offeror, its Subsidiaries and its
material joint ventures are free and clear of all Encumbrances and royalty
burdens (other than as Disclosed Publicly), and none of such mineral rights
are subject to reduction by reference to mine payout or otherwise except for
those created in the ordinary course of business and which would not have
a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Offeror, except for such
failures of title that would, individually or in the aggregate, not have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Offeror.  
      
    | (v)  |   | _Mineral Reserves and Resources._ The estimated proven
and probable mineral reserves and estimated indicated, measured and inferred
mineral resources Disclosed Publicly by the Offeror as of year-end 2004 have
been prepared and disclosed in all material respects in accordance with
accepted engineering  ##### 

 

 

\- B11 -  

       |   |   | practices and all applicable Laws. There has been
no material reduction in the aggregate amount of estimated mineral reserves,
estimated mineral resources or mineralized material of the Offeror, its
Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures, taken as a whole, from the
amounts Disclosed Publicly by the Offeror as of December 31, 2004.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (w)  |   | _Operational Matters._   
      
    |   |   | Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Offeror:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | all rentals, royalties, overriding royalty
interests, production payments, net profits, interest burdens and other
payments due or payable on or prior to the date hereof under or with respect
to the direct or indirect assets of the Offeror, its Subsidiaries and its
material joint ventures have been properly and timely paid;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | all rentals, payments, and obligations due and payable
or performable on or prior to the date hereof under or on account of any of
the direct or indirect assets of the Offeror, its Subsidiaries and its
material joint ventures have been duly paid, performed, or provided for prior
to the date hereof;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | all: (i) mines where the Offeror or a Subsidiary of
the Offeror is operator at the relevant time have been developed in
accordance with mining practices and in compliance with all applicable Laws;
and (ii) mines located in or on the lands of the Offeror, any Subsidiary or
material joint venture, or lands pooled or unitized therewith, which have
been abandoned by the Offeror or any Subsidiary or material joint venture of
the Offeror, have been abandoned in accordance with good mining practices and
in compliance with all applicable Laws; and (iii) all future abandonment,
remediation and reclamation obligations have been accurately Disclosed
Publicly by the Offeror without omission of information necessary to make the
disclosure not misleading; and  
      
    | (iv)  |   | all costs, expenses, and liabilities payable on or
prior to the date hereof under the terms of any contracts and agreements to
which the Offeror or any of its Subsidiaries or material joint ventures is
directly or indirectly bound have been properly and timely paid, except for
such expenses that are being currently paid prior to delinquency in the
ordinary course of business.  
   

  

       | (x)  |   | _Non-Arm s Length Transactions_. Except as
Disclosed to the Company, there are no contracts or other transactions
between the Offeror or any of its Subsidiaries or material joint ventures, on
the one hand, and any (i) officer or director of the Offeror or any of its
Subsidiaries or material joint ventures, (ii) any holder of  
---|---|---|--- ##### 

 

 

\- B12 -  

       |   |   | record or beneficial owner of 5% or more of any
class of the voting or non-voting equity securities of the Offeror, or (iii)
any Affiliate or Associate of any such officer, director or beneficial owner,
on the other hand.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (y)  |   | _Reports._ The Offeror has filed with all applicable
securities regulatory authorities, stock exchanges and all applicable self-
regulatory organizations true and complete copies of all forms, reports,
schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed by it since
January 1, 2003, and all such documents complied in all material respects
with the requirements of applicable Securities Laws. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Offeror has filed with the
Ontario Securities Commission and the applicable securities regulatory
authorities of the other provinces and territories of Canada, by posting upon
the SEDAR system, true and complete copies of all forms, reports, schedules,
statements and other documents required in accordance with applicable
Securities Laws to be filed by it in the last three years. (Such forms,
reports, schedules, statements and other documents, including any financial
statements or other documents, including any schedules included therein, are
referred to as the "Offeror SEDAR Documents".) The Offeror has also filed
with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents
required to be so filed by it in the last three years in accordance with
applicable Securities Laws in the United States (the "Offeror
SEC Documents"). The Offeror SEDAR Documents and the Offeror SEC Documents at
the time filed: (i) did not contain any misrepresentation of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; and (ii) complied in all material respects
with the requirements of applicable Securities Laws. The Offeror has not
filed any confidential material change report with the Ontario Securities
Commission or any other securities authority or regulator or any stock
exchange or other self-regulatory authority which at the date hereof remains
confidential.  
      
    | (z)  |   | _Disclosure Controls and Procedures._ The Offeror has
devised and maintained a system of disclosure controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Offeror
under applicable Securities Laws is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in applicable Securities Laws.
Such disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Offeror in the reports and other filings under applicable Securities
Laws is accumulated and communicated to the Offerors management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  
      
    | (aa)  |   | _Internal Control Over Financial Reporting._ The
Offeror maintains internal control over financial reporting. Such internal
control over financial reporting is  ##### 

 

 

\- B13 -  

       |   |   | effective in providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with Canadian GAAP
and includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Offeror and its
Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with Canadian GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Offeror and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Offeror and its
Subsidiaries; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Offerors and its Subsidiaries assets that could have a material effect on
its financial statements. To the Knowledge of the Offeror, prior to the date
of this Agreement: (A) there are no significant deficiencies in the design or
operation of, or material weaknesses in, the Offerors internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Offerors ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (B) there is no fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Offerors internal control over financial reporting. Since December 31,
2004 and prior to the date of this Agreement, the Offeror has received no (x)
material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters or (y) expressions of concern from employees of
the Offeror regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (bb)  |   | _Up-the-Ladder Reporting_. No attorney representing
the Offeror or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the
Offeror or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of
any Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the
Offeror or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Offerors chief legal officer, audit committee (or
other committee designated for the purpose) of the board of directors or the
board of directors.  
      
    | (cc)  |   | _Stock Exchange Compliance._ The Offeror is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE and the TSX.  
      
    | (dd)  |   | _No Prohibited Personal Loans._ Neither the Offeror
nor any of its Subsidiaries has made, arranged or modified (in any material
way) any extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan or otherwise, to
any executive officer or director of the Offeror or any of its Subsidiaries
that would be prohibited by Section 402 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002.  
      
    | (ee)  |   | _Fees._ The Offeror has Disclosed to the Company all
agreements that could give rise to any claim for an advisory fee, success
fee, brokerage commission, finders  ##### 

 

 

\- B14 -  

       |   |   | fee or other like payment against the Offeror or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Offer.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ff)  |   | _Cumulative Breach_. The breaches, if any, of the
representations made by the Offeror in this Agreement that would occur if all
references in such representations to phrases concerning materiality were
deleted, are not breaches that in the aggregate represent circumstances which
have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Offeror.  
      
    | (gg)  |   | _Financing Arrangements_. The Offeror has made
adequate arrangements to ensure that the required funds are available to
effect payment in full of the cash component of the purchase price payable
for all of the Common Shares acquired pursuant to the Offer.  
    #####

 Subject to any exceptions contained in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company represents and warrants to and in favour of the Offeror as follows:

Company free and clear of all Encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever
held by third parties. Other than as Disclosed to the Offeror or Disclosed

the Companys Subsidiaries; and (ii) all ownership interests of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in the Companys material joint ventures are owned free
and clear of all Encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever held by third

privileges or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments (pre-
emptive, contingent or otherwise) obligating the Company or any Subsidiary to

kind convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of the Company. All
outstanding Company Equity Securities and the Common Shares to be issued on
conversion of the Convertible Debentures and Preferred Shares, Series H, and
on exercise of the Options have been duly authorized. The outstanding Company
Equity Securities are, and the Common Shares to be issued on conversion of
the Convertible Debentures and on exercise of the Options, will be when

shares, free of pre-emptive rights. There are no outstanding bonds,
debentures or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company having the right
to vote (or, other than the Convertible Debentures, that are convertible for

the outstanding Company Equity Securities on any matter. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to repurchase, redeem (except
on the exercise of retraction rights in the discretion of the holder in
accordance with the terms of outstanding securities) or otherwise acquire any
of its outstanding securities or with respect to the voting or disposition of
any outstanding securities of any of its Subsidiaries or material joint
ventures. No holder of securities issued by the Company or any Subsidiary
has any right to compel the Company to register or otherwise qualify
securities for public sale in Canada or the United States or elsewhere.

Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Offer

---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | The authorization of this Agreement, the execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the performance by it of its
obligations under this Agreement, and the consummation of the Offer, any
Compulsory Acquisition or any subsequent Amalgamation of the Offeror and the
Company, will not:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | result (with or without notice or the passage of
time) in a violation or breach of, or constitute a default under, require any
consent to be obtained under or give rise to any third party right of
termination, cancellation, acceleration, penalty or payment obligation or

of incorporation, articles, by-laws or other charter documents or
any agreement with a shareholder or the agreements covering any of
its material joint ventures;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | any applicable Laws (subject to obtaining
the regulatory approvals Disclosed to the Offeror), except to the
extent that the violation or breach of, or failure to obtain any
consent under, any applicable Laws, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Company or, if any Contemplated Transaction were consummated,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Offeror; or  
      
    | (C)  |   | any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, licence, permit, government grant to which the Company, any
Subsidiary or any of its material joint ventures is party or by which it is
bound, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company or, if any Contemplated Transaction were consummated, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Offeror;

credit of the Company, any Subsidiary or any of its material joint ventures
to cease to be available; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (iii)  |   | result in the imposition of any encumbrance, charge
or lien upon any assets of the Company, any Subsidiary or any of its material
joint ventures, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company.  
   

  

       |   |   | No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
declaration or filing with, any governmental authority is required to be
obtained by the Company, its Subsidiaries or its material joint ventures in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement other than those
which are contemplated by this Agreement or Disclosed to the Offeror.

    | (d)  |   | _Financial Statements._ "Predecessor Financial
Statements" shall mean the audited consolidated financial statements of
Noranda Inc. (including any related notes thereto) for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004, and the unaudited consolidated
financial statements of Noranda Inc. for each of the quarters ended March 31,
2005 and June 30, 2005. "Company Financial Statements" shall mean: (i) the
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including any
related notes thereto) for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003; and (ii) the unaudited consolidated financial statements
of the Company for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2005 and June 30,
2005. The Predecessor Financial Statements and the Company Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP and all
applicable Laws and have been reconciled to U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") in accordance with all
applicable SEC requirements. Such Predecessor Financial Statements and
Company Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position and results of operations of Noranda Inc. and
the Company as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
covered thereby applied on a basis consistent with the immediately prior
period and throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated
expressly in the notes thereto) and, in the case of unaudited statements,
subject to normal, recurring year-end adjustments that are not material. Such
Predecessor Financial Statements and Company Financial Statements reflect
appropriate and adequate reserves in respect of contingent liabilities, if
any, of Noranda Inc., the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements of Noranda
Inc. as at March 31, 2005, for the twelve month period ended December 31,
2004 and for the three month period ended March 31, 2005 appearing
as Schedule I to the Joint Management Information Circular of the Company
dated June 2, 2005, including the notes thereto, were prepared in  ##### 

 

 

\- C5 -  

       |   |   | accordance with Canadian GAAP and were prepared
and presented in accordance with all applicable Securities Laws.
The assumptions contained therein were suitably supported and consistent with
the financial results and financial statements of the Company and its
predecessors, such statements provide a reasonable basis for the compilation
of such pro forma financial statements, and such pro forma financial
statements accurately reflect such assumptions.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | _Liabilities._ Except as Disclosed Publicly, or for
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2004, none of the Company,
its predecessors nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries or material joint
ventures has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) except for those that would not, in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company.  
      
    | (f)  |   | _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ Except as
Disclosed Publicly, since December 31, 2004: (i) and prior to the date
hereof, each of the Company, its predecessors, their Subsidiaries and each of
the Companys material joint ventures has conducted its business only in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; and (ii) there
have not occurred any circumstances or events which would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to give rise to a Material Adverse
Change with respect to the Company, or have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company.  
      
    | (g)  |   | _Books and Records._ The financial books, records and
accounts of the Company, each of its Subsidiaries and each of its material
joint ventures, in all material respects: (i) have been maintained in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the country of
domicile of each such entity on a basis consistent with prior years; (ii) are
stated in reasonable detail and accurately and fairly reflect the material
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and each of its material joint ventures; and (iii) accurately
and fairly reflect the basis for the Company Financial Statements. The
Companys and its Subsidiaries corporate minute books contain minutes of all
meetings and resolutions of the directors and securityholders held.  
      
    | (h)  |   | _Material Contracts and Non-Competition Agreements._
Except for contracts withheld from the Offeror due to confidentiality
reasons, regulatory reasons or commercial sensitivity, the Company has
provided the Offeror with complete copies of all material contracts of the
Company, whether or not entered into in the ordinary course of business.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary, nor any of its material joint
ventures, is a party to or bound by any non-competition agreement or any
other agreement or obligation which purports to limit the manner or the
localities in which all or any material portion of the business of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or its material joint ventures is or would be
conducted other than such contracts which individually or in the aggregate
would not have a  ##### 

 

 

\- C6 -  

       |   |   | Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company or would not materially impair the ability of the Company to perform
its obligations hereunder or reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Offer, any Compulsory Acquisition or any
subsequent amalgamation of the Offeror and the Company.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (i)  |   | _No Defaults._ Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of its material joint ventures, nor, to the Knowledge
of the Company, any other party thereto, is in default under, and there
exists no event, condition or occurrence which, after notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute such a default under: (A) any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture or other instrument evidencing any indebtedness to which the
Company, any Subsidiary or any material joint venture is a party; or (B) any
contract, agreement, lease, licence, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation other than any evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money the
breach of any of which referred to in this subparagraph, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company. In connection with its evaluation and analysis
of the possible alternatives to, as well as the actions actually taken to
implement, the amalgamation of Falconbridge Limited and Noranda Inc. on or
about June 30, 2005, nothing came to the attention of the predecessor
companies to the Company which would, in any material respect, adversely
affect the timing of the Offeror to complete the Compulsory Acquisition, or
Subsequent Acquisition Transaction as currently contemplated by the
Offeror.  
      
    | (j)  |   | _Litigation._ (i) There is no claim, action, proceeding
or investigation that has been commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary or material joint venture of
the Company before any governmental authority which, if determined adversely
to the Company or the Subsidiary or material joint venture of the Company, as
the case may be, would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in liability to the Company or such Subsidiary or material
joint venture of the Company in excess of Cdn. $100 million or have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or, if any
Contemplated Transaction were completed, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Offeror; (ii) neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries or material joint ventures, nor any of their
respective assets and properties, is subject to any outstanding judgment,
order, writ, injunction or decree that involves or may involve, or requires
or may require an expenditure of a material amount of money as a condition
to, or a necessity for, the right or ability of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or material joint ventures to conduct its business in a
manner in which it currently conducts such business which would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company; (iii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any material joint venture is subject to any warranty,
negligence, performance or other claims or disputes or potential claims or
disputes in respect of products or services currently being  ##### 

 

 

\- C7 -  

       |   |   | delivered or previously delivered, and to the
Knowledge of the Company there are no events or circumstances which would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such claims or disputes or
potential claims or disputes, in each case which, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company.

---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the use by the Company, any Subsidiaries and its

its material joint ventures have commenced legal proceedings against any
Person relating to an infringement by such Person of any Applicable IP;  
   

  

       |   |   | except in each case to the extent that could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material

aggregate not have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   |   | The Company, its Subsidiaries and its material
joint ventures have operated in accordance with all applicable Laws with
respect to employment and labour, including, but not limited to, employment
and labour standards, occupational health and safety, employment equity, pay
equity, workers compensation, human rights and labour relations and there
are no current, pending or threatened proceedings before any board or
tribunal with respect to any of the areas listed herein other than where the
failure to so operate, or for such proceedings which individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (m)  |   | _Collective Agreements._ All collective agreements to
which the Company, any Subsidiary or any material joint venture is a party
(the "Collective Agreements") have been Disclosed to the Offeror, and the
Offeror has been provided with current and complete copies of such Collective
Agreements. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no threatened or
apparent union organizing activities involving employees of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of its material joint ventures not already covered by the
Collective Agreements that would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect

its material joint ventures, is in material violation of any provision under

Effect with respect to the Company.  
      
    | (o)  |   | _Pension and Employee Benefits._ Except as Disclosed
Publicly:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | The Company has complied, in all material
respects, with all the terms of all agreements and all applicable Laws in

venture, as applicable.  
   

  

       | (p)  |   | _Tax Matters_.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | All material reports, information statements and
returns ("Returns") relating to, or required to be filed in connection with,
any Taxes (as defined below) required to be filed by or on behalf of the

action or proceeding for assessment or collection of Taxes, nor has such
event been asserted or threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary or
material joint venture of the Company, or any of their respective
assets, except where such deficiencies, actions or proceedings are not
material to the Company, such Subsidiary or such material joint venture.  
   

  

       | (q)  |   | _Compliance with Laws_ _._ The Company, its
Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures have complied with and are not
in violation of any applicable Laws, other than non-compliance or violations
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company, or which would
not materially impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
hereunder or reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Offer, any Compulsory Acquisition or any subsequent
amalgamation of the Offeror and the Company.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (r)  |   | _Licences, Etc._ The Company, each Subsidiary and each
material joint venture owns, possesses, or has obtained and is in compliance
with, all licences, permits, certificates, orders, grants and other
authorizations of or from any governmental authority necessary to conduct its
businesses substantially as now conducted or as proposed to be conducted
except for where failure to do so would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Company, or would not reasonably be expected to materially
impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder or
prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the Contemplated
Transactions.  
      
    | (s)  |   | _Insurance._ Policies of insurance in force as of the
date hereof naming the Company as an insured adequately cover all risks
reasonably and prudently foreseeable in the operation and conduct of the
business of the Company, its Subsidiaries and material joint ventures for
which, having regard to the nature of such risk and the relative cost of
obtaining insurance, it is in the opinion of the Company reasonable to seek
such insurance rather than provide for self insurance. All such policies
of insurance shall remain in force and effect (subject to taking into account
insurance market conditions and offerings and industry practices) and shall
not be cancelled or otherwise terminated as a result of any of the
Contemplated Transactions other than such cancellations as would not  #####

       |   |   | individually or in the aggregate have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or such cancellations as
have been Disclosed to the Offeror.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (t)  |   | _Environmental_. All operations of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures have been and are now in
compliance with all applicable Laws, including applicable common laws,
relating to the protection of the environment and employee and public health
and safety ("Environmental Laws"), except where the failure to be in
compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company. Except as Disclosed
Publicly, or except for those with respect to which adequate provision in
accordance with Canadian GAAP has been made on the financial statements of
the Company or a predecessor to the Company, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries or material joint ventures, is subject to:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | any proceeding, application, order or directive
which relates to environmental, health or safety matters, and which may
require any material work, repairs, construction or expenditures; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | any demand or notice with respect to any Environmental
Laws applicable to the Company, any Subsidiary or any material joint

contaminant, waste of any nature, hazardous substance, hazardous material,
toxic substance, dangerous substance or dangerous good as defined, judicially
interpreted or identified in any Environmental Law;

    | (u)  |   | _Property and Title._ Applying customary standards in
the Canadian mining industry, each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its
material joint ventures has sufficient title, clear of any title defect or

and properties with estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and/or
estimated mineral resources (other than property to which it is lessee, in

not constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company. All

ventures are free and clear of all Encumbrances and royalty  #####

and none of such mineral rights are subject to reduction by reference to mine
payout or otherwise except for those created in the ordinary course of
business and which would not have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to

Company.

\- C13 -

\- C14 -

Company under applicable Securities Laws is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable Securities
Laws. Such disclosure controls and procedures include, without

    | (aa)  |   | _Internal Control Over Financial Reporting._ The
Company maintains internal control over financial reporting. Such internal
control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the

maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with Canadian GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the

Subsidiaries; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the

its financial statements. To the Knowledge of the Company, prior to the date
of this Agreement: (A) there are no significant deficiencies in the design or
operation of, or material weaknesses in, the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the Offerors ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (B) there is no fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Since December 31, 2004

material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters or (y) expressions of concern from employees of
the Company regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.

whether or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has
reported evidence of a violation of any Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary
duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Companys chief
legal officer, audit committee (or other committee designated for
the purpose) of the board of directors or the board of directors.  #####

---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (dd)  |   | _No Prohibited Personal Loans._ Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has made, arranged or modified (in any material
way) any extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan or otherwise, to
any executive officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that would be prohibited by Section 402 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002.  
      
    | (ee)  |   | _Fees._ The Company has delivered to the Offeror
complete copies of all agreements that could give rise to any claim for an
advisory fee, success fee, brokerage commission, finders fee or other like
payment against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Offer.  
      
    | (ff)  |   | _Cumulative Breach_. The breaches, if any, of the
representations made by the Company in this Agreement that would occur if all
references in such representations to phrases concerning materiality were
deleted, are not breaches that in the aggregate: (i) represent circumstances
which have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company or, in the event that any Contemplated
Transaction were consummated, would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Offeror.
