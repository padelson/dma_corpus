Common Share of: (i)&nbsp;Cdn. $34.00 in cash; or (ii)&nbsp;0.6713 of a common share of the Offeror (the
&#147;<B>Offeror Shares</B>&#148;) and Cdn. $0.05 in cash, at the election of the holder thereof, but subject to an
aggregate maximum of Cdn. $2,872,648,913 in cash (the &#147;<B>Cash Maximum</B>&#148;) and an aggregate maximum of
200,702,404 Offeror Shares (the &#147;<B>Share Maximum</B>&#148;) in accordance in all material respects with all
applicable securities Laws (as defined in Schedule&nbsp;B to this Agreement) in Canada and the United
States (collectively, &#147;<B>Securities Laws</B>&#148;). On any take-up of Common Shares the Cash Maximum and the
Share Maximum will be pro rated to the Common Shares taken up on that date in the same proportion
that the number of Common Shares taken up on that date bears to the total number of Common Shares
outstanding on a Fully-Diluted Basis (as defined below).
In the event a Shareholder that
is an eligible Canadian resident receives a combination of cash and Offeror Shares, at the request
of such Shareholder delivered to the Offeror with its tender of Common Shares, the Offeror will
agree to duly and jointly complete with the Shareholder an election under subsection 85(1) or
subsection 85(2) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and the corresponding provision of any applicable
provincial tax legislation in respect of the transfer of the Shareholder&#146;s Common Shares to the
Offeror. The term &#147;<B>Offer</B>&#148; shall include any amendments to, or extensions of, the Offer made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, subject to subsection
1.1(d), removing or waiving any condition or extending the period during which Common Shares may be
deposited. The Offer shall be subject to the condition that there has been validly deposited under
the Offer and not withdrawn at the Expiry Time such number of Common Shares which, together with
any Common Shares directly or indirectly owned by the Offeror, constitutes at least 66 2/3% of the
Common Shares outstanding at the Expiry Time (calculated on a Fully-Diluted Basis) (as such
condition may be amended from time to time in accordance with this Agreement, the &#147;<B>Minimum Tender
Condition</B>&#148;) and shall be subject to the other conditions described in Schedule&nbsp;A hereto. For the
purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<B>Fully-Diluted Basis</B>&#148; means a basis which assumes that the number of
Common Shares outstanding is that number which would be outstanding if all rights to acquire Common
Shares, other than those which are not, and cannot in accordance with their terms become,
exerciseable within 120&nbsp;days following the Outside Date (as defined below).

such financial statements become available. The Company and its counsel shall be given an
opportunity to review and comment upon the Circular prior to mailing, recognizing that whether or
not such comments are appropriate will be determined by the Offeror, acting reasonably. The
Offeror shall not be required to make the Offer in any jurisdiction where it would be illegal to do
so or in any jurisdiction other than Canada and the United States which would require the Offeror
to file a prospectus, registration statement or other similar document. The Offeror shall file the
Circular and any other documents required by the Securities Laws in connection with the Offer with

other Person makes an offer to acquire the Common Shares by take-over bid which other offer has a
stated expiry time that is earlier than the Initial Expiry Time, the Offeror may amend or vary the
Offer to accelerate the Initial Expiry Time. For greater certainty, the provisions of Section&nbsp;1.2

purposes of securing the US/EC/Cdn. Clearances and the Other Clearances, the preparation and

shall be further limited such that the dissemination of such Confidential Data shall be confined to
those representatives of the Offeror and the Company and their advisors who have a need to know
such information for these purposes and who agree to respect such confidentiality in their dealings
with such Confidential Data. In particular, with reference to access to and the sharing of
Confidential Data of one party with representatives of the other party for the purposes of
preparing any filings or submissions under the Canadian Competition Act, the EC Merger Regulation
and the HSR Act in respect of the Offer, the general principle which shall be applied is that such

    <TD><I>Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. </I>The Company maintains internal
control over financial reporting. Such internal control over financial reporting is
effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with Canadian GAAP and includes policies and procedures that: (i)&nbsp;pertain to
the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
Canadian GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Company&#146;s and its Subsidiaries&#146; assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. To the Knowledge of the Company, prior
to the date of this Agreement: (A)&nbsp;there are no significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of, or material weaknesses in, the Company&#146;s internal controls
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Offeror&#146;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information,
and (B)&nbsp;there is no fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting. Since December&nbsp;31, 2004 and prior to the date of this
Agreement, the Company has received no (x)&nbsp;material complaints from any source
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters or (y)
expressions of concern from employees of the Company regarding questionable
accounting or auditing matters.</TD>
