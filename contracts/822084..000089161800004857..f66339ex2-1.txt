5    EXECUTION VERSION    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 3, 2000 (this "Agreement"), among TYCO
ACQUISITION CORP. X ("Parent"), a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-
owned subsidiary of TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD. ("Guarantor"), a Bermuda company,
VLMS, INC., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub"), and INNERDYNE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of
Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement,
and declared it advisable that Parent acquire all of the outstanding shares
of the Company through (i) an exchange offer (the "Offer") to exchange common
shares, par value $0.20 per share, of Guarantor ("Guarantor Common Shares")
for all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share (the "Company Common Stock"), of the Company (the "Shares") and
(ii) a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), each
pursuant to and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL");   WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend, by
approving resolutions authorizing this Agreement, to adopt this Agreement as
a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and the regulations thereunder,
and that the Offer and the Merger (together, the "Transaction") and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be undertaken pursuant to such
plan. For accounting purposes, the Merger is intended to be accounted for as
a "purchase" under United States generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP");   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the Company\'s willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Guarantor has agreed fully and unconditionally to guarantee
the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and other obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub in this Agreement (the "Guarantee"); and  
WHEREAS, the Company, Merger Sub and Parent desire to make
certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with, and
establish various conditions precedent to, the transactions contemplated
hereby.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements hereinafter set
forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:    6    ARTICLE I  
TENDER OFFER AND MERGER   SECTION 1.01 The Offer. (a) Provided that (i) this
Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.01 and
(ii) none of the events set forth in Annex I hereto shall have occurred and
be continuing, Parent shall, as soon as practicable after the date hereof,
commence the Offer. Each Share accepted by Parent pursuant to the Offer shall
be exchanged for the right to receive from Parent that number of fully paid
and nonassessable Guarantor Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio.  
For purposes of this Agreement:   "Average Share Price" means the average of
the Daily Per Share Prices for the five consecutive trading days ending on
the second trading day prior to the Designated Expiration Date.   "Daily
Per Share Price" for any trading day means the volume-weighted average of the
per share selling price on the NYSE of Guarantor Common Shares for that day,
as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets (or if such service
is unavailable, a service providing similar information selected by Parent
and the Company).   "Designated Expiration Date" means the date designated
for the expiration of the Offer following which Parent will first accept
Shares for exchange, as such expiration date may be extended from time to
time.   "Exchange Ratio" means $7.50 (the "Merger Price") divided by the
Average Share Price, subject to adjustment as provided in Section
1.09(e).   "NASDAQ" means the Nasdaq Stock Market.   "NYSE" means the New
York Stock Exchange.   (b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be
the twentieth business day from and including the date of commencement of the
Offer. The Offer shall be subject to the condition that there shall be
validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer prior to the
expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of Shares which,
together with the Shares then owned by Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub (if
any), represents at least a majority of the total number of outstanding
Shares, assuming the exercise of all options, rights and convertible
securities (if any) then currently exercisable or convertible or exercisable
within 180 days thereafter and the issuance of all Shares that the Company is
obligated to issue thereunder (such total number of outstanding Shares being
hereinafter referred to as the "Fully Diluted Shares") (the "Minimum
Condition") and to the other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto. Parent
and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive the conditions to the
Offer and to make any change in the terms or conditions of the Offer;
provided, that, without the prior written consent of the Company, no change
shall be made which decreases the number of Shares sought in the
Offer, changes the form or decreases the amount of consideration to be paid,
imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I,
changes or waives the Minimum    -2-  7  Condition or imposes any
conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I, extends
the Offer (except as set forth in the following paragraph), or makes any
other change to any of the terms and conditions to the Offer which is adverse
to the holders of Shares.   (c) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this
Agreement and the satisfaction (or waiver to the extent permitted by this
Agreement) of the conditions to the Offer, Parent shall accept for exchange
all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon
as practicable after the applicable expiration date of the Offer and shall
exchange for Guarantor Common Shares all such Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement promptly after acceptance; provided that (x) Parent
shall extend the Offer for successive extension periods not in excess of 10
business days per extension but in no event ending later than April 30, 2001,
if, at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer or any extension thereof,
any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied, until such
time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, and (y) Parent may extend
the Offer if and to the extent required by the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC"). In addition,
Parent may extend the Offer after the acceptance of Shares thereunder for a
further period of time by means of a subsequent offering period under Rule
14d-11 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and
the SEC\'s rules and regulations thereunder (the "Exchange Act"), of not more
than 20 business days to meet the objective (which is not a condition to the
Offer) that there be validly tendered, in accordance with the terms of the
Offer, prior to the expiration date of the Offer (as so extended) and
not withdrawn a number of Shares which, together with Shares then owned
by Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub, represents at least 90% of the
outstanding Shares.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional Guarantor Common
Shares shall be issued in connection with the exchange of Guarantor Common
Shares for Shares upon consummation of the Offer, and in lieu thereof each
tendering stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional
Guarantor Common Share in the Offer will be paid an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (B) the Average Share
Price.   (d) As soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall cause Guarantor to prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 to register the offer and sale of
Guarantor Common Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger (the
"Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement will include a
preliminary prospectus containing the information required under Rule
14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the "Preliminary Prospectus").
As soon as practicable but not later than the date of commencement of the
Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file, and cause Guarantor to file,
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer which will contain or incorporate by reference all or part of the
Preliminary Prospectus and form of the related letter of
transmittal (together with any supplements or amendments thereto,
collectively the "Offer Documents") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each
agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Registration Statement or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and
Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as
so corrected to be filed with the    -3-  8  SEC and to be disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO, the
Registration Statement and the Offer Documents and any material amendments
thereto prior to their being filed with the SEC.   SECTION 1.02 Company
Action. (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that its
Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has by unanimous vote
of the directors participating therein (i) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are
advisable and are fair to and in the best interest of the Company\'s
stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions
and other matters contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in
accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, and (iii) resolved to recommend
acceptance of the Offer and approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger by the Company\'s stockholders (the recommendations referred to in
this clause (iii) are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the
"Recommendations"). The Company further represents that U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray Inc. (the "Company Financial Advisor") has rendered to the Company\'s
Board of Directors its opinion that the consideration to be received by the
Company\'s stockholders pursuant to this Agreement is fair to
such stockholders from a financial point of view. The Company has been
advised that all of its directors and executive officers currently intend to
tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer.   (b) As soon as practicable on
the day that the Offer is commenced, the Company will file with the SEC and
disseminate to holders of Shares a Solicitation/ Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9") which shall reflect the
Recommendations, provided that they have not been withdrawn as permitted
hereby. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree, promptly to correct
any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as
so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any material
amendments thereto prior to its being filed with the SEC.   (c) The Company
will promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 5.03) with a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists
of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case as
of the most recent practicable date, and will provide to Parent and Merger
Sub such additional information (including, without limitation, updated lists
of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request in connection
with the Offer.   SECTION 1.03 Directors. (a) Effective upon the acceptance
for exchange by Parent of Shares pursuant to the Offer (the "Appointment
Time"), Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company\'s Board of Directors
that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the
Company\'s Board of Directors (giving effect to the election of any
additional directors pursuant to this    -4-  9  Section 1.03) and (ii)
the percentage that the number of Shares owned by Guarantor, Parent and
Merger Sub (including Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number
of Shares outstanding, and the Company shall take all action reasonably
necessary to cause Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the
Company\'s Board of Directors, including, without limitation, increasing
the number of directors, or seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors, or both; provided that, prior to the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 1.05), the Company\'s Board of Directors shall always have
at least two members who were directors of the Company prior to consummation
of the Offer (each, a "Continuing Director"). If the number of Continuing
Directors is reduced to less than two for any reason prior to the Effective
Time, the remaining and departing Continuing Directors shall be entitled to
designate a person to fill the vacancy and, thereafter, such person shall be
a Continuing Director. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if Parent\'s designees are elected to the Company\'s Board of
Directors prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of the Continuing
Directors shall be required for the Company to (a) amend or terminate this
Agreement or agree or consent to any amendment or termination of this
Agreement, (b) waive any of the Company\'s or its stockholders\' rights,
benefits or remedies hereunder, (c) extend the time for performance of
Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s respective obligations hereunder, or (d) approve
any other action by the Company which is reasonably likely to adversely
affect the interests of the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent,
Merger Sub and their affiliates), with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) The Company\'s obligations to appoint
designees to its Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all actions required pursuant to this Section 1.03 and Rule
14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03 and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company
and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-l to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03. Parent will supply
to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.   SECTION 1.04 The Merger. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").   SECTION 1.05 Effective Time;
Closing. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company and Merger
Sub will prepare and file a certificate of merger, in such appropriate form
as determined by the parties, with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the
"Certificate of Merger") (the time of such filing (or such later time as may
be agreed in writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the
Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as practicable on
or after the Closing Date. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place at the offices of Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP, 919 Third
Avenue, New York, New York, at a time and date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or at
such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing
(the "Closing Date").    -5-  10   SECTION 1.06 Effect of the Merger.
At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall possess all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub, and shall be subject to all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub.   SECTION 1.07 Certificate of
Incorporation; Bylaws. (a) At the Effective Time, the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended, as provided by law; provided, however, that at the
Effective Time Article Fourth of the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows:
"The number of shares that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is
10,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share".   (b) At the
Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended.   SECTION 1.08 Directors and Officers. The initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly
appointed.   SECTION 1.09 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:   (a) Conversion of the Company
Common Stock. Each share of the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of the Company
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.09(b) and other than shares
as to which appraisal rights are exercised pursuant to Section 1.14, will be
canceled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Section
1.09(e)) into the right to receive the number of Guarantor Common Shares
equal to the Exchange Ratio upon surrender of the certificate representing
such share of the Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.10
(together with the cash in lieu of fractional Guarantor Common Shares as
specified below, the "Merger Consideration"). No fraction of a Guarantor
Common Share will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof, a
cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 1.10(e).   (b) Cancellation
of the Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of the Company Common
Stock held by the Company or owned by Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof.    -6-  11   (c) Stock Options; Employee
Stock Purchase Plan. At the Effective Time, all options or rights ("Company
Stock Options") to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding, whether
under (i) the Company\'s 1987 Stock Option Plan, (ii) the Company\'s 1989
Incentive Stock Plan (the "1989 Plan"), (iii) the Company\'s 1996 Stock
Option Plan, (iv) the Company\'s 2000 Directors\' Option Plan or (v)
otherwise (together, the "Company Stock Option Plans"), shall be treated in
accordance with Section 5.12 of this Agreement. Rights outstanding under the
Company\'s employee stock purchase plan (the "Company ESPP") or any similar
U.S. plan shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.12 of this
Agreement.   (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock"),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares
of Merger Sub common stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. If,
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Guarantor or the
Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period,
or the issuance or exercise of the Rights (as hereinafter defined), the
Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement
shall be appropriately adjusted.   SECTION 1.10 Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall select an institution reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the
Merger.   (b) Exchange Fund. Following the Effective Time, Parent
shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed for exchange in
accordance with this Article I, (i) the Guarantor Common Shares and (ii) an
amount of cash sufficient to permit the Exchange Agent to make the necessary
payments of cash in lieu of fractional Guarantor Common Shares in accordance
with Section 1.10(e) (such cash in lieu of fractional shares and Guarantor
Common Shares, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") payable pursuant
to Section 1.09 in exchange for outstanding shares of the Company Common
Stock.   (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates ("Certificates") which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock
whose shares were converted into the right to receive Guarantor Common Shares
pursuant to Section 1.09, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (that
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the   
-7-  12  surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing Guarantor Common Shares. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole Guarantor
Common Shares into which their shares of the Company Common Stock were
converted at the Effective Time, (or an equivalent evidence of ownership of
Guarantor Common Shares under Guarantor\'s direct registration system)
payment in lieu of fractional shares that such holders have the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.10(e) and any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 1.10(d), and the Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates
will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes,
to evidence only the right to receive the number of full Guarantor Common
Shares into which such shares of the Company Common Stock shall have been so
converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the
issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.10(e) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.10(d). No interest
will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional Guarantor Common
Shares or on any unpaid dividends or distributions payable to holders of
Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of the
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of Guarantor Common
Shares (or an equivalent evidence of ownership of Guarantor Common Shares
under Guarantor\'s direct registration system) may be issued to a transferee
if the Certificate representing such shares of the Company Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.   (d) Distributions With Respect to
Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
after the date of this Agreement with respect to Guarantor Common Shares with
a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any
unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the Guarantor Common Shares
represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall
surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable law, following surrender
of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the holders of
certificates representing whole Guarantor Common Shares issued in exchange
therefor (or an equivalent evidence of ownership of Guarantor Common Shares
under Guarantor\'s direct registration system), without interest, (i)
promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to the number of
Guarantor Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
1.10(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
Guarantor Common Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender,
payable with respect to such whole Guarantor Common Shares.   (e) Fractional
Shares. No certificate or scrip representing fractional Guarantor Common
Shares will be issued in the Offer or the Merger upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional Guarantor Common Shares will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of
Guarantor Common Shares. In lieu of any such fractional Guarantor Common
Shares, each holder of Certificates who would otherwise have been entitled to
a fraction of a Guarantor Common Share in exchange for such Certificate   
-8-  13  (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such
holder) pursuant to this Section shall receive from the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, a cash payment in lieu of such fractional Guarantor Common Share,
determined by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled by (B) the Average Share Price.   (f)
Required Withholding. The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement, and from any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 1.10(d), to any holder or former holder of the Company Common Stock
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under
any other applicable law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.   (g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event
that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, certificates representing the Guarantor Common Shares into which the
shares of the Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates were
converted pursuant to Section 1.09 (or an equivalent evidence of ownership of
Guarantor Common Shares under Guarantor\'s direct registration system), cash
for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.10(e)
and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.10(d);
provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the delivery of such certificates representing Guarantor Common
Shares, cash and other distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Guarantor,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   (h) No
Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.10,
neither the Exchange Agent, Guarantor, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Guarantor Common Shares or
the Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (i)
Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of the Company Common Stock for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of the Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the
provisions of this Section 1.10 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the
Guarantor Common Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional Guarantor
Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.10(e) and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Guarantor Common Shares to
which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.10(d), in each case, without
any interest thereon.   SECTION 1.11 No Further Ownership Rights in the
Company Common Stock. All Guarantor Common Shares issued in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 1.10(d) and (e)) shall be deemed to have been issued    -9- 
14  in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the
Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of the Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after
the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article I.   SECTION 1.12 Tax Consequences. It is intended by the
parties hereto that the Transaction shall constitute a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto adopt
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Income Tax Regulations.  
SECTION 1.13 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub, the officers and directors of the Company, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation will take all such lawful and necessary action in the name of the
Company or Merger Sub. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform all of its
obligations relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.   SECTION 1.14 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding Section 1.09,
if the Merger is effectuated pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL
shall not be converted into a right to receive from Parent that number of
fully paid and nonassessable Guarantor Common Shares equal to the Exchange
Ratio, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses
his or her right to appraisal. If after the Effective Time such holder fails
to perfect or withdraws or loses his or her right to appraisal, such Shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
a right to receive from Parent that number of fully paid and nonassessable
Guarantor Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Any amounts paid to a holder
pursuant to a right of appraisal will be paid by the Company out of Company
assets and in no event shall Parent or any affiliate thereof reimburse the
Company for such payments.    ARTICLE II   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF THE COMPANY   The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:   SECTION 2.01 Organization and Qualification;
Subsidiaries. (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the    -10- 
15  jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power
and authority necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports
to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good
standing or to have such power or authority would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Except as disclosed in
Section 2.01 of the written disclosure schedule previously delivered by the
Company to the Parent (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in Section
2.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not directly or
indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in,
any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or
entity, with respect to which interest the Company has invested (and
currently owns) or is required to invest $100,000 or more, excluding
securities in any publicly-traded company held for investment by the Company
and comprising less than five percent of the outstanding stock of
such company.   (b) The Company has no subsidiaries.   (c) When used in
connection with the Company or Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, as the
case may be, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect or
circumstance that is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the
business, assets (including intangible assets), financial condition or
results of operations of the Company or Guarantor and its subsidiaries, as
the case may be, in each case taken as a whole; provided, however, that the
following shall be excluded from the definition of "Material Adverse Effect"
and from any determination as to whether a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or may occur: changes, effects or circumstances, that are applicable
to (A) the healthcare or medical device industries generally, (B) the United
States securities markets generally, (C) changes or disruptions
resulting from the announcement of the execution of this Agreement and the
proposed consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including without limitation, impacts on distributors, license partners,
employees or consultants, other than the loss of one or more customers which,
individually or in the aggregate, accounted for more than 20% of the sales of
the Company in the most recent fiscal year (collectively, without giving
effect to the qualifications regarding loss of more than 20% of sales,
"Transaction Changes"), and (D) changes in economic, regulatory or political
conditions generally.   (d) The failure of a representation or warranty to
be true and correct, either individually or together with the failure of
other representations or warranties to be true and correct, or the failure to
perform an obligation, agreement or covenant shall be deemed to have a
Material Adverse Effect if (x) the business, assets (including intangible
assets), financial condition, or results of operations of the Company, or of
Guarantor and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, as the case may be, are or
are reasonably likely to be materially worse than if such representation or
warranty had been true and correct or such obligation, agreement or covenant
had been performed, excluding, however, the effects of the changes specified
in the proviso set forth in Section 2.01(c), (y) in the case of the Company,
such representation or warranty materially misstates the    -11- 
16  capitalization of the Company or (z) the failure of such representation
or warranty to be true and correct or the failure to perform such
obligation, agreement or covenant materially and adversely affects the
ability of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 2.02 Certificate
of Incorporation and By-laws. The Company has heretofore made available to
Parent a complete and correct copy of its Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws as amended to date (the "Company Charter
Documents"). Such Company Charter Documents are in full force and effect. The
Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the Company Charter
Documents, except for violations of the Company Charter Documents which do
not and are not reasonably likely to materially interfere with the
operations of the Company.   SECTION 2.03 Capitalization. The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 40,000,000 shares of Company Common
Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Company Preferred Stock"). As of September 29, 2000, (i) 23,077,723 shares
of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable (excluding shares which are issued but
not outstanding all of which are not entitled to vote), (ii) 3,065,381 shares
of Company Common Stock were reserved for existing grants and 1,487,272
shares were reserved for future grants pursuant to the Company Stock Option
Plans, (iii) 356,286 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and
available for future issuance pursuant to the Company ESPP, and (iv) 232,500
shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding
warrants. There are no outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock. Except
as set forth in Section 2.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no change in
such capitalization has occurred since September 29, 2000, except for changes
resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options and shares issued
pursuant to the ESPP. Except as set forth in Section 2.01, this Section 2.03
or Section 2.11 or in Section 2.03 or Section 2.11(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character binding on the
Company relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or
obligating the Company to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of,
or other equity interests in, the Company. All shares of Company Common
Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid and nonassessable.
Except as disclosed in Section 2.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Company SEC Documents (as defined in Section 2.07), there are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of Company Common Stock. Except as disclosed in Section
2.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no obligations, contingent
or otherwise, of the Company to provide funds to, or make any investment (in
the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any entity other
than obligations in amounts less than $50,000 individually and $250,000 in
the aggregate.   SECTION 2.04 Authority Relative to this Agreement. (a) The
Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by
all    -12-  17  necessary corporate action, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated (other than the
approval by the Company\'s stockholders in accordance with the DGCL and the
Company Charter Documents and the filings and recording of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL).   (b) Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties in Section 3.13, the provisions of Section 203
of the DGCL will not apply to the Offer or the Merger.   (c) As of the date
hereof, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) unanimously determined
that it is advisable and in the best interest of the Company\'s stockholders
for the Company to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, (ii)
unanimously approved this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, and (iii) unanimously recommended the
adoption and approval of this Agreement by holders of the Company
Common Stock and directed that this Agreement be submitted for consideration
by the Company\'s stockholders at the meeting of the stockholders of the
Company to consider the Merger (the "Company Stockholders Meeting"). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Guarantor,
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and/or the Guarantee hereof, as
applicable, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms.   SECTION
2.05 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. (a) Section 2.05(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule includes, as of the date hereof, a list of (i)

business and involving, in the case of any such contact, agreement,
commitment, or other understanding or arrangement, individual payments or
receipts by the Company of less than $150,000 over the term of such contract,
commitment, agreement, or other understanding or arrangement; and (iii) all
agreements which are required to be filed as "material contracts" with the
SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act but have not been so
filed with the SEC.   (b) Except as set forth in Section 2.05(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company does not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company
will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, (ii) conflict with or violate any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the Company or
by which its properties are bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach
of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default), or impair the Company\'s rights or alter the
rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights
of termination,    -13-  18  amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or result in the creation of a lien or encumbrance on (including a right to
purchase) any of the properties or assets of the Company pursuant to, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company is a party
or by which the Company or any of its properties are bound or affected,
except, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect.   (c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company does not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will
not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing
with or notification to any governmental, administrative or regulatory
authority, domestic or foreign (each a "Governmental Authority"), except (i)
for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder (the "Securities

merger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations

this Agreement, and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger or other

consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Merger, or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing
its material obligations under this Agreement, or would not otherwise
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
Adverse Effect, or (iii) as to which any necessary consents,
approvals, authorizations, permits, filings or notifications have heretofore
been obtained or filed, as the case may be, by the Company.   SECTION 2.06
Compliance; Permits. (a) Except as disclosed in Section 2.06(a) of the

Effect; provided, the Company makes no representation in this Section 2.06(a)
with respect to matters covered by Sections 2.11, 2.12, 2.16 and 2.17.  
(b) Except as disclosed in Section 2.06(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule

in the aggregate,    -14-  19  to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company is in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except as
described in the Company SEC Documents or where the failure to so comply
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 2.07 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are
not expected to be material in amount.   SECTION 2.08 Absence of Certain

amendments or changes in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws

SEC Documents, there is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding

governmental body, agency or official, United States or non-United States,
which would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have
a Material Adverse Effect or that in any manner challenges or seeks to

the other transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 2.11 Employee Benefit
Plans; Employment Agreements. (a) Section 2.11(a) of the Company Disclosure

Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and
has all corporate power and all government licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted,
except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
the absence of which would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Guarantor. Parent has heretofore made available to

and authority necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports
to own, lease and operate and to carry on its business as now conducted,
except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Guarantor. Each subsidiary of Guarantor is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure
to be so qualified or in good standing would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Guarantor. Except as set forth in Section 3.01(b)

Company (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule"), all of Guarantor\'s "significant"
subsidiaries, as defined in Regulation S-X, and their respective

Agreement, the execution, delivery and performance by Guarantor of the
Guarantee and the consummation by Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, as applicable, do not and

complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act and Exchange Act, as the case may be; and (ii) each

to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.   (b) Each of the consolidated

or any other Person for whom Guarantor or any subsidiary may be liable or any
of their respective properties before any court or arbitrator or any
governmental body, agency or official, United States or non-United States,
that would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have

seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the Merger, the Offer or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 3.10
Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus. (a) Subject to the
accuracy of the representations of the Company in Section 2.13:   (i) the
Registration Statement, as it may be amended, pursuant to which the Guarantor

the Company or become effective under the Securities Act, or at any time
Parent accepts for exchange Shares pursuant to the Offer, contain any untrue

Additionally, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any and all written consents of customers which, pursuant to the
terms of any contracts, agreements or arrangements with such customers, are
required to prevent the termination of such contracts, agreements or
arrangements in connection with, or as a result of, the Transaction, except
if and insofar as the failure to obtain such consents would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 4.02 No Solicitation. (a) The Company shall not, directly
or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative or
agent of the Company, solicit or encourage the initiation of (including
by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals regarding any
merger, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including without
limitation by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving the
Company that if consummated would constitute an Alternative Transaction (as
defined in Section 7.01) (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being
referred to herein as an "Acquisition Proposal"). Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (i)
furnishing information to a third party which has made a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal (as defined below) not
solicited in violation of this Agreement, provided that such third party has
executed an agreement with confidentiality provisions substantially similar
to those then in effect between the Company and a subsidiary of Guarantor or
(ii) subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 4.02,
including Sections 4.02(c) and (d), considering and negotiating a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal not solicited in violation
of this Agreement; provided, however, that, as to each of clauses (i) and
(ii), (x) such actions occur at a time prior to initial acceptance of Shares
for exchange in the Offer and (y) the Board of Directors of the Company
reasonably determines in good faith (after due consultation with independent
counsel, which may be Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP), that it is or is
reasonably likely to be required to do so in order to discharge properly its
fiduciary duties. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means
any proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all of the equity
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors or all or substantially all the assets of the Company, on terms
which the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes (i)
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, which may be the Company Financial Advisor) to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement taking into account at the time
of determination any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent and (ii) to be more favorable to the Company than the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement after taking into
account all pertinent factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of
the Company under the laws of    -35-  40  the State of Delaware;
provided, however, that a Superior Proposal may be subject to a due diligence
review of confidential information and to other customary conditions.   (b)
The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any modification of or
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic
information relating to the Company in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the
Company by any person or entity that informs the Board of Directors of the
Company that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal.
Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate
the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to
make an Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access
to the books and records of the Company, the terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal, and whether
the Company is providing or intends to provide the person making the
Acquisition Proposal with access to information concerning the Company as
provided in Section 4.02(a). The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on
a current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material
changes or modifications in the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall also immediately notify
Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters into negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal.   (c) Except to the extent the Board of Directors of
the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after due consultation with
independent counsel, which may be Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP) that it
is or is reasonably likely to be required to act to the contrary in order to
discharge properly its fiduciary duties (and, with respect to the approval,
recommendation or entering into any, Acquisition Proposal, it may take such
contrary action only after the second business day following Parent\'s and
Merger Sub\'s receipt of written notice of the Board of Directors\' intention
to do so), neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company
shall withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval by such Board of Directors of
this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger.   (d) The Company and the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not (i) redeem the rights (the "Rights")
issued under the Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated as of September 19,
1997, as amended, between the Company and the American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"), or waive or amend
any provision of the Rights Agreement, in any such case to permit or
facilitate the consummation of any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative
Transaction, or (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to, or otherwise
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal or Alternative Transaction, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms. It is understood and agreed that a
deferral of the distribution of Rights following the commencement of a tender
offer or exchange offer shall not be prohibited hereunder.   (e) Nothing
contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to its
stockholders required by applicable law, rule or regulation.    -36- 
41   (f) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent and
Merger Sub) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. The
Company agrees not to release any third party from the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any agreement to which the Company is a party.  
(g) The Company shall ensure that the officers and directors of the Company
and any investment banker or other advisor or representative retained by the
Company are aware of the restrictions described in this Section 4.02.  
SECTION 4.03 Conduct of Business by Guarantor Pending the Merger. During the
period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of
the termination of this Agreement or the initial acceptance of Shares for
Exchange in the Offer, Parent covenants and agrees that, except as set forth
in Section 4.03 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or unless the Company shall
otherwise agree in writing, Parent shall take all action necessary so that
(i) Guarantor shall conduct its business, and cause the businesses of its
subsidiaries to be conducted, in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practice, including actions taken by Guarantor or

consummate the Merger, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause Guarantor
to, as soon as practicable following the acceptance of Shares pursuant to the
Offer, prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the Company Stockholders Meeting,
and the Company shall, and Parent shall cause Guarantor to, prepare and
Parent shall file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement (the "Post-Effective Amendment") for the offer and exchange of the
Guarantor Common Shares pursuant to the Merger and in which the Proxy

Parent shall cause Guarantor to, use all reasonable efforts to have the Post-
Effective Amendment declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing and to maintain such effectiveness for so
long as shall be required for the issuance of the Guarantor Common Shares in
the Merger. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders as promptly
as practicable after the Post-Effective Amendment is declared effective under
the Securities Act. Parent shall also cause Guarantor to take any action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required
to be taken under the applicable state securities laws in connection with the
issuance of Guarantor Common Shares in the Offer and the Merger, and the
Company shall furnish to Guarantor all information concerning the Company and
the holders of capital stock of the Company as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution
of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. No filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Post-
Effective Amendment or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by the
Company or the Guarantor, without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company,
promptly after Guarantor receives notice thereof, of the time when the Post-
Effective Amendment has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Guarantor Common Shares issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Post-Effective Amendment or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. Company
will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request
by the SEC for the amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either of the Post-
Effective Amendment or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information   
-38-  43  shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.   (b) Parent shall
cause Guarantor to include as an exhibit to the Registration Statement tax
opinions of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe
LLP, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and to the
Company, on the basis of customary facts, representations, warranties,
covenants and assumptions set forth in such opinions (including without
limitation assumptions that (i) the Minimum Condition shall be satisfied, and
(ii) the Merger shall be completed promptly following the Offer), to the
effect that the Transaction will be treated for federal income tax purposes
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code that is
not subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.367(a)-3(c) (other than with respect to Company stockholders who
are or will be "5% transferee stockholders" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)), and that each of Guarantor, Parent
and the Company will be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(b) of the Code.   (c) The Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor
of approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement.   SECTION 5.02
Company Stockholders Meeting. (a) If Section 5.02(c) shall not apply and

establish, prior to or as soon as practicable following the date upon which
the Post-Effective Amendment becomes effective, a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly
as practicable for the purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement,
and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders and to hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable after the Post-
Effective Amendment is declared effective under the Securities Act.
The Company shall solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of approval
of this Agreement and shall take all other reasonable action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders in favor of such
approval.   (b) Parent and Merger Sub agree to vote all Shares acquired
in the Offer or otherwise beneficially owned by them, Guarantor or any of
their subsidiaries in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger at the Company Stockholder Meeting and to take such other actions
to effectuate as promptly as practicable the Merger pursuant to Section 251
of the DGCL, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing above, if Parent shall
acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Shares in the Offer, Parent shall
contribute all of its Company Common Stock to Merger Sub and the parties
hereto shall take all necessary actions (including actions referred to in
Sections 5.01 (a) and (b) above, as applicable) to cause the Merger to become
effective, as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer, without
a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of
the DGCL.    -39-  44   SECTION 5.03 Access to Information;
Confidentiality. Upon reasonable notice and subject to restrictions contained
in confidentiality agreements to which such party is subject (from which such
party shall use reasonable efforts to be released), the Company shall and
Parent shall take all action necessary such that Guarantor shall (i) afford
to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of
the other, reasonable access, during the period after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, to its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, (ii) during such
period, furnish promptly to the other all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably
request, and each shall make available to the other the appropriate
individuals (including attorneys, accountants and other professionals) for
discussion of the other\'s business, properties and personnel as either
Parent or the Company may reasonably request. Each party shall keep such
information confidential in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality
agreement, dated August 1, 2000 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between a
subsidiary of Guarantor and the Company.   SECTION 5.04 Consents; Approvals.
The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
and to cooperate with each other in order to obtain all consents, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders (including, without limitation, all
United States and non-United States governmental and regulatory rulings and
approvals), and the Company and Parent shall make (or Parent shall take all
action necessary such that Guarantor will make) all filings (including,
without limitation, all filings with United States and non-United States
governmental or regulatory agencies) required in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
Parent and the consummation by them of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   SECTION 5.05 Agreements with Respect to Affiliates. The
Company shall deliver to Parent, prior to the date the Registration Statement

Letter") identifying all persons who are anticipated to be "affiliates" of
the Company at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting for purposes of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act ("Rule 145"). The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is identified as an
"affiliate" in the Affiliate Letter to deliver to Parent, prior to the date
of the initial acceptance of Shares for exchange in the Offer, a written
agreement (an "Affiliate Agreement") restricting the sales of securities by
such affiliates in accordance with the restrictions on affiliates under Rule
145, in a form mutually agreeable to the Company and Parent.   SECTION 5.06
Indemnification and Insurance. (a) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect
to indemnification set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
the By-laws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, modified
or otherwise repealed for a period of six years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder as of the
Effective Time of individuals who at the Effective Time were directors,
officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is
required after the Effective Time by law and then only to the minimum extent
required by such law.   (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law or under the Surviving Corporation\'s
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws,    -40-  45  indemnify and
hold harmless, each present and former director, officer or employee of the
Company (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or
expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, (x) arising out of or pertaining
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) otherwise with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
to the same extent as provided in the Company\'s Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws or any applicable contract or agreement as in effect
on the date hereof, in each case for a period of six years after the
Effective Time. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) and
subject to the specific terms of any indemnification contract, (i) any
counsel retained by the Indemnified Parties for any period after the
Effective Time shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation,
(ii) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements
therefor are received and (iii) the Surviving Corporation will cooperate in
the defense of any such matter; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld);
and provided, further, that, in the event that any claim or claims
for indemnification are asserted or made within such six-year period, all
rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until the disposition of any and all such claims. The Indemnified
Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them in each
applicable jurisdiction with respect to any single action unless there is,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties, in which case each Indemnified Person with respect to whom such a
conflict exists (or group of such Indemnified Persons who among them have no
such conflict) may retain one separate law firm in each applicable
jurisdiction.   (c) The Surviving Corporation shall honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to indemnification
agreements and employment agreements (the employee parties under such
agreements being referred to as the "Officer Employees") with the Company\'s
directors and officers existing at or before the Effective Time.   (d) In
addition, Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time,
the Company\'s current directors and officers with an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO; Insurance") that is no less
favorable than the existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO; Insurance in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance, but in such case shall
purchase as much such coverage as possible for such amount.   (e) From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall unconditionally guarantee the timely
payment of all funds owing by, and the timely performance of all other
obligations of, the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.06.

Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable
by the Indemnified Parties.   SECTION 5.07 Notification of Certain Matters.
The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event
the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be expected to
cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be
materially untrue or inaccurate, or (ii) any failure of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub, as the case may be, materially to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   SECTION 5.08 Further
Action/Tax Treatment. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof,
each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly
as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to obtain in
a timely manner all necessary waivers, consents and approvals and to effect
all necessary registrations and filings, and otherwise to satisfy or cause to
be satisfied all conditions precedent to its obligations under this
Agreement. The foregoing covenant shall not include any obligation
by Guarantor to agree to divest, abandon, license, enter into, modify,
maintain or renew any contract arrangement regarding or take similar action
with respect to any assets (tangible or intangible) of Guarantor or the
Company. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause Guarantor to, use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Transaction to qualify, and will not (either before
or after consummation of the Merger) take any actions, or fail to take any
action, that might reasonably be expected to prevent the Transaction from
qualifying as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the
Code that is not subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-(3)(c) (other than with respect to
Company stockholders who are or will be "5% transferee stockholders" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)). Parent

the regulations thereunder, the Transaction for United States federal income
tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code.   SECTION 5.09 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any
written public statement with respect to the Transaction or this Agreement
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld; provided, however, that either party may, without the prior consent
of the other, issue such press release or make such public statement as may
upon the advice of counsel be required by law or the rules and regulations of
the NYSE or The Nasdaq Stock Market if it has used all reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party.    -42-  47   SECTION 5.10 Guarantor
Common Shares. (a) Parent shall take all action necessary so that Guarantor
shall transfer to Parent the Guarantor Common Shares to be delivered by

transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and any similar taxes which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that

In no event shall Parent or any affiliate thereof reimburse the Company for
the payment of such taxes and fees.   SECTION 5.12 Option Plans; ESPP; Other
Programs. (a) Except as provided in Paragraph (b) below, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, or such earlier date as required pursuant to the relevant

fully vested and immediately exercisable and the holder of each such Company
Stock Option shall be entitled to exercise such option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, or such earlier date as required pursuant to the relevant
Company Stock Option Plan. Except as provided in Paragraph (b) below, any
such outstanding Company Stock Option remaining unexercised as of the
Effective Time shall expire as of such time, and shall entitle the holder
thereof to an amount in cash equal to the amount by which (i) the product of
the Exchange Ratio and the Average Share Price, multiplied by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock for which the Company Stock Option was
exercisable as of the Effective Time exceeds (ii) the aggregate exercise
price of the Company Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock
Option.   (b) Each Company Stock Option issued after April 7, 1993
under the 1989 Plan shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions set forth in the relevant Company Stock Option Plan and
applicable award agreement immediately prior to the Effective Time; except
that (i) each such Company Stock Option will be exercisable (or will become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole Guarantor
Common Shares equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such the Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of Guarantor Common Shares and (ii)
the per share exercise price for the Guarantor Common Shares issuable upon
exercise of such Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of the Company Common
Stock at which such Company Stock option was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent; provided, however, that the holder of any such Company Stock Option may
agree that such option be treated under Section 5.12(a).    -43-  48

with respect to all employees of the Company who become employees of Parent
or Surviving Corporation immediately following the Closing (the
"Transferred Employees"), provide for their coverage under pension and
welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements (the "Current Benefit
Plans") providing benefits not substantially less favorable in the aggregate
to the Transferred Employees than the Current Benefit Plans covering such
Transferred Employees as in effect immediately prior to the Closing,
including group health plans which do not exclude or limit the coverage of
such Transferred Employees on account of waiting periods or pre-existing
conditions, and which have in all material respects identical or superior
coverage in terms of employee participation.   (c) It is expressly agreed
that (i) the provisions of Sections 5.12(e) and 5.13 are not intended to be
for the benefit of or otherwise enforceable by any third party, including,
without limitation, any Transferred Employees and (ii) except as provided in
Section 5.12(e), nothing herein shall prevent the Surviving Corporation or

modifying the terms and conditions of employment or other service of any
particular employee or any other person.   SECTION 5.14 Rights Agreement.

Property Transfer Statutes. The Company agrees that it shall use its
reasonable commercial efforts to comply promptly with all requirements of
applicable state property transfer laws as may be required by the relevant
state agency and shall take all action necessary to cause the transactions
contemplated hereby to be effected in compliance with applicable state
property transfer laws. The Company, after consultation with Parent, shall
determine which actions must be taken prior to or after the Effective Time to

provide Parent with any documents required to be submitted to the relevant
state agency prior to submission, and the Company shall not take any action
to comply with applicable state property transfer laws without Parent\'s

Company with respect to such compliance.   SECTION 5.17 Amendment of 401(k)

Warrant prior to the Effective Time, the number (rounded to the nearest whole
number) of Guarantor Common Shares as the holder of such Warrant would have
been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised
such Warrant in full immediately prior to the Effective Time, at a price per
Guarantor Common Share equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for Company
Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Warrant divided by (y)
the number of Guarantor Common Shares deemed purchasable pursuant to such
Warrant.    -45-  50   ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

any representation or warranty of the Company or Parent, respectively, set
forth in this Agreement, shall have become untrue in any material respect,
or, in the case of such representations and warranties as are qualified by
materiality, in any respect a "Terminating Change"), in either case other
than by reason of a Terminating Breach (as hereinafter defined); provided
that, if any such Terminating Change is curable prior to the Designated
Expiration Date by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, through the
exercise of its reasonable best efforts, and for so long as the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, continues to exercise such reasonable best
efforts, neither Parent nor the Company, respectively, may terminate
this Agreement under this Section 7.01(g); or    -47-  52   (h) prior

reasonable best efforts, neither Parent nor the Company, respectively, may
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.01(h); or   (i) by the
Company, in order to accept a Superior Proposal; provided that (A) Parent
shall not have accepted any Shares for exchange pursuant to the Offer; (B)

clause of this Section 7.01, the Agreement shall also be deemed to have been
terminated pursuant to such other clauses.   As used herein, "Alternative
Transaction" means any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or

part of any party hereto or any of its affiliates, directors, officers or

nothing herein shall relieve the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from liability
for any willful material breach hereof (it being understood    -48-

not constitute such a willful material breach).   SECTION 7.03 Fees and
Expenses. (a) Except as set forth in this Section 7.03, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the

shall be publicly announced by the Company or any third party within 9 months
following the date of termination of this Agreement and such transaction
shall at any time thereafter be consummated on substantially the terms
