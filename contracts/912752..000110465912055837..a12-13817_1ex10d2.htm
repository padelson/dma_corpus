and all rights of Seller against a third party thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Seller, Buyer nor any of their Affiliates shall be required

 **Section 2.09.** ** **_General Proration_.

 



 

(a) All Purchased Assets that would be classified as current assets in
accordance with GAAP, and all Assumed Liabilities that would be classified as
current liabilities in accordance with GAAP, shall be prorated between Buyer
and Seller as of the Effective Time, including by taking into account the
elapsed time or consumption of an asset during the month in which the
Effective Time occurs (respectively, the " _Prorated Purchased Assets_ " and
the " _Prorated Assumed Liabilities_ "). Such Prorated Purchased Assets and
Prorated Assumed Liabilities relating to the period prior to the Effective
Time shall be for the account of Seller and those relating to the period on
and after the Effective Time for the account of Buyer and shall be prorated
accordingly. In accordance with this _Section 2.09_, (i) Buyer shall be
required to pay to Seller the amount of any Prorated Purchased Asset
previously paid for by Seller or a High Plains Entity, to the extent Buyer
will receive a current benefit on and after the Effective Time, provided that
such amount should not have been recognized as an expense in accordance with
GAAP prior to the Effective Time (the " _Buyer Prorated Amount_ "); and (ii)
Seller shall be required to pay to Buyer the amount of any Prorated Assumed
Liabilities to the extent they arise with respect to the operation of the
Business prior to the Effective Time and are not assumed or paid for by Seller
(the " _Seller Prorated Amount_ "). Such payment by Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, shall be made within ten (10) Business Days after the Final
Settlement Statement becomes final and binding upon the parties.

 



 

(b) Such prorations shall include all ad valorem and other property Taxes, FCC
regulatory fees, utility expenses, liabilities and obligations under
Contracts, rents and similar prepaid and deferred items, reimbursable expenses
and all other expenses and obligations, such as deferred revenue and
prepayments and sales commissions, attributable to the ownership and operation
of the Stations that straddle the period before and after the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.09_ to the contrary, (i) except
as set forth in this clause (b), with respect to Tradeout Agreements for the
sale of time for goods or services assumed by Buyer, if at the Effective Time,
the Stations have an aggregate negative barter balance (i.e., the amount by
which the value of air time to be provided by the Stations the Effective Time
exceeds the fair market value of corresponding goods and services to be
received after such date), there shall be no proration or adjustment, unless
the aggregate negative barter balance of the Stations exceeds $150,000, in
which event such excess shall be treated as prepaid time sales of Seller, and
adjusted for as a proration in Buyers favor. In determining barter balances,
the value of air time shall be based upon Sellers rates as of the Effective
Time, and corresponding goods and services shall include those to be received
by the Stations after the Effective Time plus those received by the Stations
before the Effective Time to the extent conveyed by Seller to Buyer as part of
the Purchased Assets, (ii) there shall be no proration under this _Section
2.09_ to the extent there is an aggregate positive barter balance with respect
to Tradeout Agreements and (iii) there shall be no proration under this
_Section 2.09_ for Program

 



      
 

 



 

Rights agreements except to the extent that any payments or performance due
under such Program Rights agreements relate to a payment period that straddles
the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Accrued vacation and 10% of accrued sick pay for Transferred Employees
shall be included in the prorations.

 



 

(d) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Newport shall
provide Buyer with a good faith estimate of the prorations contemplated by
this _Section 2.09_ (the " _Estimated Settlement Statement_ "). Any payment
required to be made by either party pursuant to such preliminary estimate
shall be made by the appropriate party at the Closing in accordance therewith,
absent manifest error. Newport will afford Buyer reasonable access to all
records and work papers used in preparing the Estimated Settlement Statement,
and Buyer shall notify Newport of any good faith disagreement with such
calculation within two (2) Business Days of receiving the Estimated Settlement
Statement. At the Closing, (i) Buyer shall be required to pay to Seller the
amount equal to the Estimated Adjustment if the Estimated Adjustment is a
positive number or (ii) Seller shall be required to pay to Buyer the amount
equal to the Estimated Adjustment if the Estimated Adjustment is a negative
number.

 



 

(e) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Newport a proposed proration of assets and liabilities in the
manner described in this _Section 2.09_ (the " _Settlement Statement_ ")
setting forth the Seller Prorated Amount and the Buyer Prorated Amount,
together with a schedule setting forth, in reasonable detail, the components
thereof.

 



 

(f) Newport shall provide reasonable access to such employees, books, records,
financial statements, and its independent auditors as Buyer reasonably
believes is necessary or desirable in connection with its preparation of the
Settlement Statement.

 



 

(g) During the thirty (30)-day period following the receipt of the Settlement
Statement, Newport and its independent auditors shall be permitted to review
and make copies reasonably required of, (i) the financial statements relating
to the Settlement Statement, (ii) the working papers relating to the
Settlement Statement, (iii) the books and records relating to the Settlement
Statement and, (iv) any supporting schedules, analyses and other documentation
relating to the Settlement Statement.

 



 

(h) The Settlement Statement shall become final and binding (the " _Final
Settlement Statement_ ") upon the parties on the 45th day following delivery
thereof, unless Newport gives written notice of its disagreement with the
Settlement Statement (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer prior to such
date. The Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature
of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is given to Buyer
in the period specified, then the Final Settlement Statement (as revised in
accordance with clause (i) or (ii) below) shall become final and binding upon
the parties on the earlier of (i) the date Buyer and Newport resolve in
writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement or (ii) the date any disputed matters are finally
resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Within ten (10) Business Days after the Final Settlement Statement becomes
final and binding upon the parties, (i) Buyer shall be required to pay to
Seller the amount, if any, by which the Final Adjustment is higher than the
Estimated Adjustment or (ii) Seller shall be required to pay to Buyer the
amount, if any, by which the Estimated Adjustment is higher than the Final
Adjustment, as the case may be. All payments made pursuant to this _Section
2.09(i)_ must be made via wire transfer in immediately available funds to an
account designated by the recipient party, together with interest thereon at
the prime rate (as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported
thereby, by another authoritative source) as in effect from time to time from
the Effective Time to the date of actual payment.

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Newport delivers a Notice
of Disagreement, Seller or Buyer shall be required to make a payment of any
undisputed amount to the other regardless of the resolution of the disputed
items contained in the Notice of Disagreement. Seller or Buyer, as applicable,
shall within ten Business Days of the receipt of the Notice of Disagreement
make payment to the other by wire transfer in immediately available funds of
such undisputed amount owed by Seller or Buyer to the other, as the case may
be, together with interest thereon, calculated as described above.

 



 

(k) During the thirty (30)-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement to Buyer that complies with the preceding paragraphs, Buyer and
Newport shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences they
may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement.
During such period (i) Buyer and its independent auditors, at Buyers sole
cost and expense, shall be, and Newport and its independent auditors, at
Newports sole cost and expense, shall be, in each case permitted to review
and make copies reasonably required of (w) the financial statements of the
Business, in the case of Buyer, and Buyer, in the case of Newport, relating to
the Notice of Disagreement, (x) the working papers of Newport, in the case of
Buyer, and Buyer, in the case of Newport, and such other partys auditors, if
any, relating to the Notice of Disagreement, (y) the books and records of
Newport, in the case of Buyer, and Buyer, in the case of Newport, relating to
the Notice of Disagreement, and (z) any supporting schedules, analyses and
documentation relating to the Notice of Disagreement; and (ii) Newport, in the
case of Buyer, and Buyer, in the case of Newport, shall provide reasonable
access, upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, to
such employees of such other party and such other partys independent
auditors, as such first party reasonably believes is necessary or desirable in
connection with its review of the Notice of Disagreement.

 



 

(l) If, at the end of such thirty (30)-day period, Buyer and Newport have not
resolved such differences, Buyer and Newport shall submit to the Accounting
Firm for review and resolution any and all matters that remain in dispute and
that were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement. Within sixty (60)
days after selection of the Accounting Firm, Buyer and Newport shall submit
their respective positions to the Accounting Firm, in writing, together with
any other materials relied upon in support of their respective positions.
Buyer and Newport shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving the matters in dispute within
thirty (30) days following the submission of such materials to the Accounting
Firm. Buyer and Newport agree that judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
party against which such determination is to be enforced. Except as specified
in the following sentence, the

 



      
 

 



 

cost of any arbitration (including the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm) pursuant to this _Section 2.09_ shall be borne by Buyer and Newport in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting
Firm, which proportional allocations shall also be determined by the
Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is
rendered on the matters submitted. The fees and expenses (if any) of Buyers
independent auditors and attorneys incurred in connection with the review of
the Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Buyer, and the fees and expenses
(if any) of Newports independent auditors and attorneys incurred in
connection with their review of the Settlement Statement shall be borne by
Newport.

 



 

 **Section 2.10.** ** **_Multi-Station Agreements_. In the event that one or
more Other Seller Stations is party to, or has rights or obligations with
respect to, an Assumed Contract (a " _Multi-Station Agreement_ "), the rights
and obligations under such Multi-Station Agreement that are assigned to and
assumed by Buyer (and included in the Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities, as the case may be) shall include only those rights and
obligations under such Multi-Station Agreement that are applicable to the
Stations. The rights of each Other Seller Station with respect to such Station
Contract and the obligations of each Other Seller Station to such Station
Contract shall not be assigned to and assumed by Buyer (and shall be Excluded
Assets).

 



 

 **Section 2.11.** ** **_Closing on Certain Stations_. Notwithstanding
anything set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event FCC Consent
or HSR Clearance has not been obtained prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day
prior to the Termination Date and the principal reason such FCC Consent or HSR
Clearance has not been obtained (as reasonably determined by the respective

foregoing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its

policies on the Owned Real Property and commitments for lessees and lenders
title insurance policies for all Real Property that is leased pursuant to a
Real Property Lease (collectively the " _Title Commitments_ "), and (b) an
ALTA survey on each parcel of Real Property (the " _Surveys_ "). The Title

such amount as Buyer directs. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in
obtaining such Title Commitments and Surveys, provided that neither Seller nor

Liens, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of such objectionable matter as
soon as Buyer becomes aware that such matter is not an Assumed Liability or
Permitted Lien, and Seller agrees to use such efforts that are necessary to
remove such objectionable matter as required pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

Purchased Assets between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,

appropriate under the circumstances) any lost or damaged Purchased Asset (the
" _Damaged Asset_ ") unless such Damaged Asset was obsolete and unnecessary

Plains Entitys (as applicable) past practice and the FCC Licenses. If Seller
is unable to repair or replace a Damaged Asset by the Effective Time, Seller
shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Buyer
in repairing or replacing the Damaged Assets or assign to Buyer the applicable
portion of any insurance proceeds not previously expended by Seller or a High
Plains Entity to repair or replace the damaged or destroyed property after the

any Damaged Asset for which Seller makes a payment or which is replaced by
Seller or a High Plains Entity pursuant to this _Section 5.04_.

directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage or entertain any
inquiries or proposals from, discuss or negotiate with, provide any nonpublic
information to or consider the merits of any inquiries or proposals from any
Person (other than Buyer) relating to any business combination transaction
involving the Purchased Assets or the Stations (other than in the ordinary
course of business or as provided by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this _Section 5.05_ will cease to apply in the event that (a) Buyer
determines in good faith that any further reasonable efforts of Buyer
requested by Seller to prosecute the FCC Applications pursuant to _Section
7.01(b)_ should not be made, (b) Seller determines in good faith that the FCC
Consent is not likely to be granted or (c) Seller determines in good faith
that any other condition to the Closing in _Article X_ is not likely to be
satisfied (other than as a result of Sellers breach). Seller shall notify
Buyer of any such inquiry or proposal within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt
or awareness of the same by Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
acknowledges that this _Section 5.05_ does not apply to any potential
transaction involving the Other Seller Stations, Newport, High Plains, their
respective Subsidiaries or their assets on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.06.** ** **_No-Hire_. During the period beginning on the date
hereof and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, each
Seller will not, and each Seller will cause the High Plains Entities, their
respective subsidiaries and any successor entity formed by Providence and
Sandy DiPasquale to acquire, own and operate television stations (collectively
with Seller, the " _Seller Prohibited Entities_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit to employ or hire any Employee of Newport or High Plains
who is contemplated to be or is a Transferred Employee, unless Buyer first
terminates the employment of such employee, such employee voluntarily
terminates without inducement by Newport or High Plains or Buyer gives its
written consent to such employment or offer of employment; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such entities shall be permitted to make a general
solicitation for employment not targeted to any Employee of Seller who is
contemplated to be or is a Transferred Employee and shall not be prohibited
from employing any such employee pursuant to such a general solicitation. The
time period referred to in this _Section 5.06_ shall be tolled on a day-for-
day basis for each day during which any Seller Prohibited Entity participates
in any activity in violation of this _Section 5.06_ so

 



      
 

 



 

that the Seller Prohibited Entities shall be restricted from engaging in the
conduct referred to in this _Section 5.06_ of this Agreement for the full
period contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **Section 5.07.** ** **_Financial Statements_. Seller shall deliver to Buyer
(i) prior to the 60th day following Closing audited combined financial
statements of the Stations for the year ended December 31, 2011, (ii) within
60 days after the date hereof for the 2012 second calendar quarter and within
60 days after the end of each calendar quarter with respect to any calendar
quarter after the 2012 second calendar quarter prior to the Closing Date,

quarter (with footnotes and comparative period presented) and (iii) if the
Closing occurs after December 31, 2012, within 60 days after Closing, audited
combined financial statements of the Stations for the year ended December 31,
2012. Buyer and Seller shall each pay fifty percent of the fees and expenses
of Sellers accounting firm in connection with the preparation and/or review
of the financial statements required by this _Section 5.07_ until such fees
and expenses have reached $200,000 in the aggregate, and Buyer shall pay all
such fees and expenses in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate. Buyer and
Seller will reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the
preparation of the financial statements required pursuant to this _Section
5.07_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI** 
COVENANTS OF BUYER

 



 

 **Section 6.01.** ** **_Access to Information_. As soon as practicable after
the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice, Buyer will afford promptly to Seller
and its agents reasonable access to its properties, books, records, employees
and auditors to the extent necessary to permit Seller to determine any matter
relating to its rights and obligations (or those of its Affiliates) hereunder
or to any period ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that Seller will hold, and will cause its agents to hold, in confidence, all
confidential or proprietary information to which it has had access to pursuant
to this _Section 6.01_; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that such access
shall not unreasonably interfere with Buyers business or operations.

 



 

 **Section 6.02.** ** **_Accounts Receivable_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall deliver to Buyer, promptly after the commencement of the
Collection Period, a statement of the Accounts Receivable. Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect the Accounts Receivable during the
period (the " _Collection Period_ ") beginning on the Closing Date and ending
on the 150th day thereafter, in the ordinary course of business; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall be under no obligation to commence or not to
commence litigation or legal action to effect collection. Any payment received
by Buyer during the Collection Period from a customer of the Stations that was
or is also a customer of Seller or a High Plains Entity and that is obligated
with respect to any Accounts Receivable shall be deposited by Buyer in the
Seller Account on the date of receipt thereof (each such payment, a "
_Specified Payment_ " and, collectively, the " _Specified Payments_ "). Any
payments that are made directly to Seller or a High Plains Entity during the
Collection Period relating to the Accounts Receivable shall be retained by
Seller. Buyer and its Affiliates shall not discount, adjust or otherwise
compromise any Accounts Receivable and Buyer shall promptly refer any disputed
Accounts Receivable to Seller.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each Specified Payment received by Seller or a High Plains Entity pursuant
to _Section 6.02(a)_ that is not specifically designated in writing as a
payment of a particular invoice or invoices shall be presumptively applied by
Seller to the accounts receivable for such customer outstanding for the
longest amount of time, and the portion of each such Specified Payment, if
any, that is attributable to accounts receivable that are not Accounts
Receivable (each such portion, a " _Remitted Payment_ " and, collectively, the
" _Remitted Payments_ "), shall be remitted by Seller to Buyer in accordance
with _Section 6.02(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Closing
Date, Seller or Buyer received or receives a written notice of dispute from a
customer with respect to an Accounts Receivable that has not been resolved,
then Seller shall apply any payments from such customer to such customers
oldest, non-disputed accounts receivable, whether or not an Accounts
Receivable.

 



 

(c) Seller shall deposit all Remitted Payments (without offset) into an
account identified by Buyer in immediately available funds by wire transfer on
or before the fifth (5th) Business Day following the receipt by Seller thereof
pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)_. Seller shall furnish Buyer with a list of the
amounts collected during such calendar month and in any prior calendar months
with respect to the Accounts Receivable and a schedule of the amount remaining
outstanding under each particular account. Each of Seller and Buyer shall be
entitled during the sixty (60)-day period following the Collection Period to
inspect and/or audit the records maintained by each other pursuant to this
_Section 6.02_, upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business
hours.

 



 

(d) Following the expiration of the Collection Period, neither Buyer nor
Seller shall have any further obligations under this _Section 6.02_, except
that Buyer shall immediately pay over to Seller any amounts subsequently paid
to it with respect to any Accounts Receivable. Following the Collection
Period, Seller may pursue collections of all the Accounts Receivable, and
Buyer shall deliver to Seller all files, records, notes and any other
materials relating to the Accounts Receivable and shall otherwise cooperate
with Seller for the purpose of collecting any outstanding Accounts Receivable.

 



 

(e) Buyer acknowledges that Seller may maintain all established cash
management lockbox arrangements in place at the Effective Time for remittance
until such time as Seller deems appropriate to close such lockboxes. Buyer
agrees to update the Accounts Receivable aging reports to reflect all Seller
lockbox receipts, and Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer to keep the
Accounts Receivable age reports current. In addition, Seller shall, on or
before the fifth (5th) Business Day following the end of the calendar month in
which any of Buyers receivables are received by Seller through its lockbox,
remit to Buyer such receivable collections.

 



 

(f) If Seller or Buyer fails to timely remit any amounts collected pursuant to
this _Section 6.02_, such amount shall bear interest at the prime rate (as
reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, by another
authoritative source) as in effect from time to time from the date any such
amount was due until the date of actual payment.

 



 

(g) All amounts received by Seller (other than amounts representing Remitted
Payments) pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall not be required to be
refunded or repaid by Seller for any circumstance.

 



       
 

 



 

 **Section 6.03.** ** **_Termination of Rights to the Names and Marks_. As
soon as practicable after the Closing Date (and in any event within ninety
(90) days thereafter), Buyer shall and shall cause each of its Affiliates to
(a) cease and discontinue all uses of and (b) delete or remove the names and
marks set forth on _Disclosure Schedule Section 6.03_ from all products,
signage, vehicles, properties, technical information and promotional
materials. Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that the rights of the
Business to the names and marks set forth on _Disclosure Schedule Section
6.03_ pursuant to the terms of any agreements between Seller and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Stations, on the other, shall terminate
on the Closing Date.

 



 

 **Section 6.04.** ** **_Insurance Policies_. All of the insurance policies
with respect to the Stations and the Business shall be cancelled by Seller as
of the Closing Date, and any refunded premiums shall be retained by Seller.
Buyer will be solely responsible for acquiring and placing its casualty
insurance, business interruption insurance, liability insurance and other
insurance policies for the Stations and the Business, including the Purchased
Assets and Assumed Liabilities, for periods after the Closing.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII** 
COVENANTS OF BUYER AND SELLER

 



 

 **Section 7.01.** ** **_Governmental Consents_.

 



 

(a) Within five (5) business days of the date of this Agreement, Buyer and
Seller (and, pursuant to the Option Exercise Agreement, High Plains License)
shall jointly file an application or applications with the FCC (collectively,
the " _FCC Application_ ") requesting FCC consent to the assignment of the FCC
Licenses to Buyer. Buyer and Seller (and, pursuant to the Option Exercise
Agreement, High Plains License) shall diligently prosecute the FCC Application
and otherwise use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as
soon as possible; provided, however, except as provided in the following
sentence, neither Buyer nor Seller or a High Plains Entity shall be required
to pay consideration to any third party to obtain FCC Consent. Buyer and
Seller shall each pay one-half (1/2) of the FCC filing fees relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, irrespective of whether the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. Buyer and Seller each shall
oppose any petitions to deny or other objections filed with respect to the FCC
Applications to the extent such petition or objection relates to such party.
Subject to the "proposed resolutions" set forth on _Disclosure Schedule
Section 4.06_, neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any intentional action
that would, or intentionally fail to take such action the failure of which to
take would, reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially delaying
the receipt of the FCC Consent. Buyer and Seller (and, pursuant to the Option
Exercise Agreement, High Plains License) shall each promptly enter into
customary tolling or other arrangements if necessary and requested by the FCC
to resolve any complaints with the FCC relating to any of the FCC Licenses,
and, subject to the indemnification obligation set forth in Section
12.03(a)(iii), Buyer agrees to accept liability in connection with any
enforcement action by the FCC with respect to such complaints if so requested
by the FCC as part of such tolling or other arrangements. If the Closing shall
not have occurred for any reason within the original effective period of the
FCC Consent, and neither party shall have terminated this Agreement under
_Section 11.01_, Buyer and Seller (and, pursuant to the Option Exercise
Agreement, High Plains License) shall jointly request an extension of the
effective

 



      
 

 



 

period of the FCC Consent. No extension of the FCC Consent shall limit the
right of either party to exercise its rights under _Section 11.01_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the assignment of an FCC License of any
Station to Buyer is not permitted by the applicable rules of the FCC, then
Buyer shall take all necessary action to cause its rights and obligations
under this Agreement in respect of the Designated Station Assets to be
assigned to, and assumed by, a Qualified Assignee subject to, and accordance
with, the "proposed resolutions" set forth on _Disclosure Schedule Section
4.06_. Buyer shall be responsible for arranging all aspects of any necessary
assignment to a Qualified Assignee, and in such a manner intended to not delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) Within thirty-five (35) days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and
Seller shall make all required filings with the Federal Trade Commission (the
" _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")
pursuant to the HSR Act, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
(including a request for early termination of the waiting period thereunder),
and shall thereafter promptly respond to all requests received from such
agencies for additional information or documentation. Expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is referred to
herein as the " _HSR Clearance._ " Any filing fees payable under the HSR Act
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and any costs of experts
jointly engaged by Buyer and Seller to assist in obtaining the HSR Clearance
shall be borne one-half (1/2) by each the Buyer and Seller.

 



 

(d) The FCC Licenses of the Stations expire on the dates corresponding thereto
as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.12(a)(1)_ _. _If, at any point
prior to Closing, an application for the renewal of any FCC License (a "
_Renewal Application_ ") must be filed pursuant to the Communications Laws,
Seller shall timely execute, file and prosecute with the FCC such Renewal
Application in accordance with this _Section 7.01(d)_ hereof. If the FCC
Application is granted by the FCC subject to a renewal condition, then,
without limitation of _Section 7.01(a)_, _(b)_ or _(e)_ the term " _FCC
Consent_ " shall be deemed to also include the satisfaction of such renewal
condition. In addition, Buyer acknowledges that, to the extent reasonably
necessary to expedite grant by the FCC of any Renewal Application and thereby
to facilitate grant of the FCC Application, Seller and High Plains License (as
applicable) shall be permitted to enter into tolling agreements with the FCC
to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a
forfeiture penalty against a Station in connection with (i) any pending
complaints that such Station aired programming that contained obscene,
indecent or profane material, or (ii) any other enforcement matters against a
Station with respect to which the FCC may permit Seller or High Plains License
(as applicable) to enter into a tolling agreement; provided that Buyer shall
only agree to accept liability in connection with any such complaint or
enforcement action by the FCC, if so requested by the FCC as part of such
tolling or other arrangements, subject to the indemnification obligation set
forth in Section 12.03(a)(iii). Buyer and Seller shall consult in good faith
with each other prior to Seller or High Plains License (as applicable)
entering into any such tolling agreement under this _Section 7.01(d)_.

 



 

(e) In connection with their obligations pursuant to this _Section 7.01_ with
respect to pursuing the FCC Consent and the HSR Clearance, Buyer and Seller
shall (i) keep each other informed in all material respects and on a
reasonably timely basis of any material

 



      
 

 



 

communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any
governmental agency and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any Action by a private party, in each case with respect to
this Agreement, the Stations or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
notify each other of all documents filed with or received from any
governmental agency with respect to this Agreement, the Stations or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) furnish each other with such
information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection
with their preparation of any governmental filing hereunder and (iv) cooperate
in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission
with a governmental agency in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or
before any governmental agency relating to this Agreement, the Stations or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any Action initiated by a private
party. Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
each of Buyer and Seller shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other on, all information
relating to the other party or parties, as the case may be, and their
respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any governmental agency with
respect to this Agreement, the Stations or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

 **Section 7.02.** ** **_Confidentiality_. Seller and Buyer (or an Affiliate
of Buyer) are parties to the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to Seller
and its stations. To the extent not already a direct party thereto, Buyer
hereby assumes the Confidentiality Agreement and agrees to be bound by the
provisions thereof. Without limiting the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, subject to the requirements of applicable law, all non-public
information regarding Seller, the High Plains Entities and their Affiliates
and their business and properties that is disclosed in connection with the
negotiation, preparation or performance of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all financial information provided by Seller and the High Plains
Entities to Buyer) shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any
other Person, except Buyers representatives and lenders for the purpose of
consummating the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.03.** ** **_Sublicense under NexGen Source Code_.

(b) Effective upon the Closing Date:

 



 

(i) Buyer covenants and agrees that it shall use the Source Code solely in
connection with Buyers ownership and operation of the Stations, and except as

license, sublicense or grant any of its rights with respect to the Source Code
to any other Person, or otherwise permit any other Person to possess or use
the Source Code in any manner, other than to a Person that acquires one of
more of the Stations from Buyer or its Affiliates, in which case, Buyer shall
ensure that such Person agrees to be bound to the terms and conditions set
forth in this _Section 7.03_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Clear
Channel Communications, Inc. and its Affiliates are using and may continue to
use, and that Seller is not sublicensing to Buyer, certain software, firmware
and

 



      
 

 



 

hardware that may have previously been used in connection with or bundled with
the Source Code or into which the Source Code may have been previously
integrated, and Buyer covenants and agrees that it (and any Person that
acquires, directly or indirectly, one of more of the Stations from Buyer or
its Affiliates) will not make any claim or initiate or maintain any suit or
other proceeding against Clear Channel Communications, Inc. and its Affiliates
in respect of such retained software, firmware and hardware or the use, sale,
assignment, license or other disposition thereof.

 



 

(ii) Seller hereby grants to Buyer and its Affiliates a non-exclusive,
perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up, sublicensable (but soley to the extent
set forth in this Section 7.03(b)), transferable (but solely to the extent set
forth in this _Section 7.03(b)(ii)_), worldwide license to use, reproduce,
distribute, display, perform, improve, modify, update, upgrade, enhance, make
derivative works based upon and otherwise exploit the Source Code, but in each
case, solely in connection with the ownership and operation of the Other

license, sublicense or grant any of its rights with respect to the Source Code
to any other Person, or otherwise permit any other Person to possess or use
the Source Code in any manner, except that the license granted pursuant to
this _Section 7.03(b)(ii)_ may be sub-licensed and/or assigned by Seller to
any Person that acquires, directly or indirectly, one of more of the Stations
from Buyer or its Affiliates.

 



 

 **Section 7.04.** ** **_Control Prior to Closing_. The parties acknowledge
and agree that, for the purposes of the Communications Laws, this Agreement
and, without limitation, the covenants in _Article V_, are not intended to
and shall not be construed to transfer control of any Station or to give Buyer
any right to, directly or indirectly, control, supervise or direct, or attempt
to control, supervise or direct, the programming, operations, or any other
matter relating to any Station prior to the Closing Date, and the FCC
Licensees shall have complete control and supervision of the programming,
operations, policies and all other matters relating to each Station up to the
time of the Closing.

 



 

 **Section 7.05.** ** **_Public Announcements_. Prior to Closing, no party
shall, without the prior written consent of the other, issue any press release
or make any other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except to the extent that such party is so obligated by law

of such party are listed or traded, in which case such party shall give
advance notice to the other, and except that the parties shall cooperate to
make a mutually agreeable announcement.

 



 

 **Section 7.06.** ** **_Notices of Certain Events_. From the date hereof
until the earlier to occur of the Closing Date and such time as this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with _Article XI_, Seller, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, shall each promptly notify the other of:

 



 

(a) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(b) in the case of Seller, (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
which, to its knowledge, has caused any representation or warranty made by it
herein to be

 



      
 

 



 

untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing and (ii) any material failure on the part of
Seller to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement set
forth herein to be complied with or satisfied by Seller hereunder on or after

Seller and its Affiliates may retain and use, at their own expense, copies of
all documents or materials transferred hereunder, in each case, which (i) are
used in connection with the businesses of Seller or its Affiliates, other than
the Business, (ii) Seller or any of its Affiliates in good faith determines it
is reasonably likely to need access to in connection with the defense (or any
counterclaim, cross-claim or similar claim in connection therewith) of any

Subsidiaries shall maintain, and provide Buyer and its representatives
reasonable access to, those records of Seller and its Subsidiaries insofar as
they relate to the Purchased Assets that relate to periods prior to the
consummation of the Closing, during normal business hours and on at least ten
(10) Business Days prior written notice (or such shorter time period as
necessitated by the urgency of the underlying facts and circumstances). If
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall desire to dispose of any of such books
and records prior to the expiration of such three (3)-year period in
accordance with the record retention policies of Seller then in effect, Seller
shall, prior to such disposal, give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at Buyers
expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Buyer may select,
subject to destruction of correspondence and other similar documents in the
ordinary course, in accordance with customary retention policies and
applicable Law.

 



 

 **Section 7.08.** ** **_Cooperation in Litigation_. Buyer and Seller shall
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) reasonably cooperate with
each other at the requesting partys expense in the prosecution or defense of
any claim, litigation or other proceeding arising from or related to the
conduct of the Business and involving one or more third parties. The party
requesting such cooperation shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(excluding internal costs) incurred in providing such cooperation (including

to the TOC Buyer.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII** 
PENSION, EMPLOYEE AND UNION MATTERS

 



 

 **Section 8.01.** ** **_Employment_.

 



 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, subject to _Section 2.11_, Buyer shall
offer employment to each Employee employed immediately prior to such date who
is listed on the list included as _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.14(a)_ or
who is hired after the date of such list with the prior, written consent of
Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and who (i) is
not on authorized leave of absence, sick leave, short or long term disability
leave, military leave or layoff with recall rights (" _Active Employees_ ");
or (ii) is on authorized leave of absence, sick leave, short or long term
disability leave, military leave or layoff with recall rights and who returns
to active employment immediately following such absence and within six months
of the Closing Date, or such later date as required under applicable law ("
_Inactive Employees_ "). For the purposes hereof, all Active Employees,
Inactive Employees who accept Buyers offer of employment and commence
employment on the applicable Employment Commencement Date are hereinafter
referred to collectively as the " _Transferred Employees,_ " and the "
_Employment Commencement Date_ " as referred to herein shall mean (x) as to
those Transferred Employees who are Active Employees hired pursuant to this
_Section 8.01_, the Closing Date, and (z) those Transferred Employees who are
Inactive Employees, the date on which the Transferred Employee begins
employment with Buyer. Buyer shall employ at-will those Transferred Employees
who are not Union Employees (the " _Non-Union Transferred Employees_ ") and
who do not have employment agreements with Seller initially at a monetary
compensation (consisting of base salary, commission rate and normal bonus
opportunity) at least as favorable as those provided by Seller immediately
prior to the Employment Commencement Date. The initial terms and conditions of
employment for those Non-Union Transferred Employees who have employment
agreements with Seller shall be as set forth in such employment agreements.
Buyer agrees so long as such Non-Union Transferred Employees remain employed
by Buyer, Buyer shall provide each Non-Union Transferred Employee with
compensation that, in the aggregate, is no less favorable than the
compensation provided to the Non-Union Transferred Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time and employee benefits that are no less favorable to the
employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that sales commissions and bonuses based on
performance may be less to the extent of changes in performance by such Non-
Union Transferred Employee, to the extent such sales commissions and bonuses
are based thereon; _provided_ , _further_ , that, except as set forth in
_Section 8.05_, Buyer shall not be obligated to provide Non-Union Transferred
Employees credit for past time with respect to sick leave. Buyer agrees that
Buyer shall provide severance benefits to the Non-Union Transferred Employees
on terms

 



      
 

 



 

that are at least as favorable as those provided to similarly situated
employees of Buyer. Buyer shall employ those Transferred Employees that are
Union Employees in accordance with the terms and conditions established in the
applicable Bargaining Agreement and under applicable Law. To the extent
permitted by Law, Buyer shall give Transferred Employees full credit for
purposes of eligibility waiting periods and vesting and benefit accrual (other
than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under the employee
benefit plans or arrangements or severance practices maintained by the Buyer
or its Affiliates in which such Transferred Employees participate for such
Transferred Employees service with the Seller or its Affiliates or
predecessors.

 



 

(b) If and to the extent any Seller has entered into or is bound by any
Bargaining Agreements, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully in the
assignment and assumption of such Bargaining Agreements and in any
negotiations with respect thereto such that, as of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall have (whether through such an assumption, negotiations or otherwise) the
same rights and obligations with respect to the Union Employees who are
Transferred Employees as Seller had immediately before such date.

 



 

 **Section 8.02.** ** **_Savings Plan_. Buyer shall cause a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan established or designated by Buyer (a " _Buyer s
401(k) Plan_") to accept rollover contributions from the Transferred Employees
of any account balances distributed to them by the existing tax-qualified
defined contribution plan established or designated by Seller (" _Seller s
401(k) Plan_"). Buyer shall allow any such Transferred Employees outstanding
plan loan to be rolled into Buyers 401(k) Plan. The distribution and rollover
described herein shall comply with applicable Law, and each party shall make
all filings and take any actions required of such party by applicable Law in
connection therewith. Buyers 401(k) Plan shall credit Transferred Employees
with service credit for eligibility and vesting purposes for service
recognized for the equivalent purposes under Sellers 401(k) Plan.

 



 

 **Section 8.03.** ** **_Employee Welfare Plans_. Seller shall retain
responsibility for and continue to pay all medical, life insurance, disability
and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for each Transferred Employee
with respect to claims incurred under the terms of the Employee Plans by such
Employees or their covered dependents prior to the Employment Commencement
Date. Expenses and benefits with respect to claims incurred by Transferred
Employees or their covered dependents on or after the Employment Commencement
Date shall be the responsibility of Buyer, subject to the terms and conditions
of Buyers welfare plans. With respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained
by Buyer for the benefit of Transferred Employees on and after the Employment
Commencement Date, to the extent permitted by law, Buyer shall (a) cause there
to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre existing condition
limitations to the same extent generally waived by Buyer with respect to its
employees and (b) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-
of-pocket limitations, amounts paid by such Transferred Employees for the plan
year in which the Closing occurs with respect to similar plans maintained by
Seller.

 



 

 **Section 8.04.** ** **_Vacation_. To the extent Buyer has received a credit
in the prorations, Buyer will assume all liabilities for unpaid, accrued
vacation of each Transferred Employee as of the Employment Commencement Date,
giving credit under Buyers vacation policy for service with Seller, and shall
permit Transferred Employees to use their vacation

 



      
 

 



 

entitlement accrued as of the Closing Date in accordance with Buyers policy
for carrying over unused vacation. To the extent that, following the Closing
Date, Buyers policies do not permit a Transferred Employee to use any accrued
and unused vacation for which Buyer has assumed the liabilities hereunder
(other than as a result of such Transferred Employees failure to use such
vacation despite his or her eligibility to do so, without adverse
consequences, under Buyers policies), Buyer will pay such Transferred
Employee for any such vacation. Service with both Seller and Buyer shall be
taken into account in determining Transferred Employees vacation entitlement
under Buyers vacation policy after the Closing Date.

 



 

 **Section 8.05.** ** **_Sick Leave_. To the extent Buyer has received a
credit in the prorations, Buyer shall grant credit for all unused sick leave
accrued by Transferred Employees on the basis of their service during the
current calendar year as employees of Seller in accordance with Buyers policy
on sick leave.

 



 

 **Section 8.06.** ** **_No Further Rights_. Without limiting the generality
of _Section 13.08_, nothing in this _Article VIII_, express or implied, is
intended to confer on any Person (including any Transferred Employees and any
current or former employees of Seller or the FCC Licensees) other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
_Article VIII_.

 



 

 **Section 8.07.** ** **_Flexible Spending Plan_. As of the Closing Date (the
" _Transfer Date_ "), Seller shall transfer from the Employee Plans that are
medical and dependent care account plans (each, a " _Seller FSA Plan_ ") to
one or more medical and dependent care account plans established or designated
by Buyer (collectively, the " _Buyer FSA Plan_ ") the account balances
(positive or negative) of Transferred Employees, and Buyer shall be
responsible for the obligations of the Seller FSA Plans to provide benefits to
the Transferred Employees with respect to such transferred account balances at
or after the Transfer Date (whether or not such claims are incurred prior to,
on or after the Transfer Date). Each Transferred Employee shall be permitted
to continue to have payroll deductions made as most recently elected by him or
her under the applicable Seller FSA Plan. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the end of the plan year for the Buyer FSA Plan, including any grace
period, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for benefits paid by the Seller
FSA Plans to any Transferred Employee prior to the Transfer Date to the extent
in excess of the payroll deductions made in respect of such Transferred
Employee at or prior to the Transfer Date but only to the extent that such
Transferred Employee continues to contribute to the Buyer FSA Plan the amount
of such deficiency. This _Section 8.07_ shall be interpreted and administered
in a manner consistent with Rev. Rul. 2002-32.

 



 

 **Section 8.08.** ** **_Payroll Matters_.

 



 

(a) Seller and Buyer shall follow the " _standard procedures_ " for preparing
and filing Internal Revenue Service Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statements), as
described in Revenue Procedure 2004-53 for Transferred Employees. Under this
procedure, (i) Seller shall provide all required Forms W-2 to (x) all
Transferred Employees reflecting wages paid and taxes withheld by Seller prior
to the Employment Commencement Date, and (y) all other employees and former
employees of Seller who are not Transferred Employees reflecting all wages
paid and taxes withheld by Seller, and (ii) Buyer (or one of its Affiliates)
shall provide all required Forms W-2

 



      
 

 



 

to all Transferred Employees reflecting all wages paid and taxes withheld by
Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) on and after the Employment Commencement
Date.

 



 

(b) Seller and Buyer shall adopt the " _alternative procedure_ " of Revenue
Procedure 2004-53 for purposes of filing Internal Revenue Service Forms W-4
(Employees Withholding Allowance Certificate) and W-5 (Earned Income Credit
Advance Payment Certificate). Under this procedure, Seller shall provide to
Buyer all Internal Revenue Service Forms W-4 and W-5 on file with respect to
each Transferred Employee and any written notices received from the Internal
Revenue Service under Reg. § 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g)(5) of the Code, and Buyer will
honor these forms until such time, if any, that such Transferred Employee
submits a revised form.

 



 

(c) With respect to garnishments, tax levies, child support orders, and wage
assignments in effect with Seller on the Employment Commencement Date for
Transferred Employees and with respect to which Seller has notified Buyer in
writing, Buyer shall honor such payroll deduction authorizations with respect
to Transferred Employees and will continue to make payroll deductions and
payments to the authorized payee, as specified by a court or order which was
filed with Seller on or before the Employment Commencement Date, to the extent
such payroll deductions and payments are in compliance with applicable Law,
and Seller will continue to make such payroll deductions and payments to
authorized payees as required by Law with respect to all other employees of
the Business who are not Transferred Employees. Seller shall, as soon as
practicable after the Employment Commencement Date, provide Buyer with such
information in the possession of Seller as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer and necessary for Buyer to make the payroll deductions and payments to
the authorized payee as required by this Section 8.08(c).

 



 

 **Section 8.09.** ** **_WARN Act_. Buyer shall not take any action on or
after the Closing Date that would cause any termination of employment of any
employees by Seller that occurs before the Closing to constitute a " _plant
closing_ " or " _mass layoff_ " under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act
of 1988, as amended (the " _WARN Act_ ") or any similar state or local Law, or
to create any liability to Seller for any employment terminations under
applicable Law. Assumed Liabilities assumed by Buyer pursuant to _Section
2.03_ shall include all liabilities with respect to any amounts (including any
severance, fines or penalties) payable under or pursuant to the WARN Act or
any similar state or local Law with respect to any Employees who do not become
Transferred Employees as a result of Buyers failure to extend offers of
employment or continued employment as required by _Section 8.01_ or in
connection with events that occur from and after the Closing, and Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for any such amounts or any liabilities thereof incurred by
Seller.

consideration within the meaning of and for the purposes of Section 1060 of
the Code shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets and any other rights

allocation of such consideration on a Market-by-Market basis (the " _Market-
by-Market Allocation_ "). Buyer and Seller shall file all Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the Market-by-Market Allocation unless otherwise
required by applicable law. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith
regarding the allocation of the Purchase Price and any Assumed Obligations
allocated to a Market pursuant to the Market-by-Market Allocation among the
assets of the Stations in such Market in accordance with the requirements of
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

party agrees to complete and timely file IRS Form 8594 (or any successor
form), to file all income Tax Returns in accordance with such allocation, and
to

reach agreement with respect to such allocation then the parties shall have no
further obligation under this Section 9.06 and each party shall make its own
determination of such allocation for financial and Tax reporting purposes
provided that such partys own determination of such allocation shall be
consistent with the Market-by-Market Allocation unless otherwise required by
applicable law.

anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ ") so long
as the terminating party is not then in breach of any of its representations,

contemplated by this Agreement or if a Governmental Authority of competent

the part of Seller set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty of Seller shall have become untrue, in either case such that the
condition set forth in _Section 10.03(a)_ would not be satisfied, unless such

 **Section 11.02.** ** **_Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.01_, this Agreement (other than _Section 7.02_, this _Article XI_, and
_Article XIII_, which shall remain in full force and effect) shall forthwith
become null and void, and no party hereto

 



      
 

 



 

(nor any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or employees)
shall have any liability or further obligation, except as provided in _Section
11.02(b)_ and _Section 11.02(c)_ below. A termination of this Agreement shall
not terminate the Confidentiality Agreement, nor, in each case, affect the
parties rights and obligations thereunder.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section
11.01(c)(i)_ or _Section 11.01(c)(ii)_, then Seller shall be entitled to the
Escrow Deposit as liquidated damages, and the parties to the Escrow Agreement
shall immediately deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
directing such disbursement. If this Agreement is terminated by Seller
pursuant to _Section 11.01(c)(iii)_, then Seller shall be entitled to the sum
of Forty-One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($41,250,000) (the "
_Default Payment_ ") as liquidated damages, and Buyer shall, within one (1)
Business Day of delivery of notice of termination of this Agreement by Seller,
pay the Default Payment to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
federal funds pursuant to wire instructions provided by Seller to Buyer.
Seller shall, in addition, be entitled to prompt payment on demand from Buyer
of the reasonable attorneys fees actually incurred by Seller in enforcing its
rights under this Agreement. The parties understand and agree that the amount
of liquidated damages represents Sellers and Buyers reasonable estimate of
actual damages and does not constitute a penalty. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that Seller
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.01(c)(i)_, _Section
11.01(c)(ii)_ or _Section 11.01(c)(iii)_, the payment of the Escrow Deposit
or the Default Payment, as the case may be, together with any attorneys fees,
pursuant to this _Section 11.02(b)_, shall be Sellers sole and exclusive
remedy for damages of any nature or kind that Seller may suffer as a result of
Buyers breach or default under this Agreement or Buyers failure to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which would result
in Sellers right to terminate this Agreement under _Section 11.01(c)(i)_,
_Section 11.01(c)(ii)_ or _Section 11.01(c)(iii)_, as the case may be. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the liquidated damages amount is
reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to
be caused by material breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty
of proof of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of
otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to
be consummated hereunder.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section
11.01(d)(i)_ or _Section 11.01(d)(ii)_, then Seller shall be liable for any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by Buyer in an aggregate amount not to
exceed Forty-One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($41,250,000).

 



 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated under the provisions of this _Article XI_
for any reason other than by Seller pursuant to _Section 11.01(c)(i)_,
_Section 11.01(c)(ii)_ or _Section 11.01(c)(iii)_, then the parties to the
Escrow Agreement shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
directing the disbursement of the Escrow Deposit to Buyer.

anniversary of the Closing Date. None of the covenants and agreements shall
survive the Closing except to the extent such covenants and agreements
contemplate performance after the Closing, in which case such covenants and
agreements shall survive until performed. No claim may be brought under this
Agreement unless written notice describing in reasonable detail the nature and

forth in _Section 12.01_ and (B) until the aggregate amount of Seller
Indemnified Parties Losses resulting from Buyer Warranty Breaches exceeds
fifty-two one hundredths of one percent (.52%) of the Purchase Price (the "
_Threshold_ ") and then only to the extent of such Losses in excess of twenty-
six one hundredths of one percent (.26%) of the Purchase Price (the "
_Deductible_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the cumulative indemnification
obligation of Buyer under this _Section 12.02(b)_ shall in no event exceed
ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Cap_ "), _provided_ _further_
, _however_ , that neither the Deductible nor the Cap shall apply in the case
of any indemnification under clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of _Section
12.02(a)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 12.02(b)_ above, on and as of the date that is
six (6) months following the Closing Date, the Cap shall be reduced to an
amount equal to (x) five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price plus (y) the
amount of any claims by the Seller Indemnified Parties for indemnification
under this Agreement outstanding and unpaid as of such date, if any, pursuant
to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. On the
date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, the Cap shall be
reduced to the amount of any claims by the Seller Indemnified Parties for
indemnification under this Agreement outstanding and unpaid as of such date,
if any, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 12.03.** ** **_Indemnification by Seller_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 12.01_, Seller, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify against and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective
employees, officers, directors, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from, and agrees to promptly defend any Buyer
Indemnified Party from and reimburse any Buyer Indemnified Party for, any and
all Losses which such Buyer Indemnified Party may at any time suffer or incur,
or become subject to, as a result of or in connection with

 



 

(i) Sellers breach of any of the representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement (each such breach, a " _Seller Warranty Breach_ ");

 



 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Seller under
the terms of this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) the Excluded Liabilities (including any Losses which Buyer incurs as a
result of accepting liability for any enforcement action by the FCC relating
to any period prior to the Closing) or, subject to _Section 9.02_, any
failure to comply with laws relating to bulk sales; and

 



 

(iv) the Excluded Assets.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Seller shall not be
required to indemnify and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant
to _Section 12.03(a)_: (A) unless such Buyer Indemnified Party has asserted a
claim with respect to such matters within the applicable survival period set
forth in _Section 12.01_ and (B) until the aggregate amount of Buyer
Indemnified Parties Losses resulting from Seller Warranty Breaches exceeds
the Threshold, and then only to the extent of such Losses in excess of the
Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , that the cumulative indemnification
obligation of Seller under this _Section 12.03(b)_ shall in no event exceed
the Cap; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that neither the Deductible nor
the Cap shall apply in the case of any indemnification under clauses (ii),
(iii) and (iv) of _Section 12.03(a)_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 12.02(b)_ above, on and as of the date that is
six (6) months following the Closing Date, the Cap shall be reduced to an
amount equal to (x) five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price plus (y) the
amount of any claims by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for indemnification
under this Agreement outstanding and unpaid as of such date, if any, pursuant
to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. On

 



      
 

 



 

the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, the Cap shall
be reduced to the amount of any claims by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
indemnification under this Agreement outstanding and unpaid as of such date,
if any, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) At Closing, Providence Equity Partners VI L.P. and Providence Equity
Partners VI-A L.P. (collectively, " _Providence_ ") are delivering a guarantee
in favor of Buyer, in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_
(the " _Providence Guarantee_ "), pursuant to which Providence is guaranteeing
Sellers obligations under this _Section 12.03_.

 



 

 **Section 12.04.** ** **_Notification of Claims_.

 



 

(a) A party entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Section 12.02_ or
_Section 12.03_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party
liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of
any claim or demand that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or
could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that a failure to give prompt notice or to include any specified
information in any notice will not affect the rights or obligations of any
party hereunder except and only to the extent that, as a result of such
failure, any party that was entitled to receive such notice was damaged as a
result of such failure. Subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to defend in
good faith third party claims as hereinafter provided, the Indemnifying Party
shall satisfy its obligations under this _Article XII_ within thirty (30)
days after the receipt of written notice thereof from the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) If the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of any claim
or demand pursuant to _Section 12.04(a)_, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to
defend any such claim or demand asserted against the Indemnified Party for so
long as the Indemnifying Party shall continue in good faith to diligently
defend against such action or claim. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense of any such claim or demand at its own
expense. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party in writing,
as promptly as possible (but in any case five (5) Business Days before the due
date for the answer or response to a claim) after the date of the notice of
claim given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party under _Section
12.04(a)_ of its election to defend in good faith any such third party claim
or demand. So long as the Indemnifying Party is defending in good faith any
such claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise such claim or demand
without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and the Indemnified Party shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party or its agents all records and other material in the
Indemnified Partys possession reasonably required by it for its use in
contesting any third party claim or demand. Whether or not the Indemnifying
Party elects to defend any such claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall
have no obligations to do so. In the event: (i) the Indemnifying Party elects
not to defend such claim or action; or (ii) the Indemnifying Party elects to
defend such claim or action but fails to diligently defend such claim or
action in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct
the defense thereof and to settle or compromise such claim or action without
the consent of the Indemnifying Party, except that with respect to the
settlement or compromise of such a claim, demand or action, the Indemnified
Party shall not settle or compromise any such claim or

 



      
 

 



 

demand or action without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld), unless the Indemnifying Party is given a
full and completed release of any and all liability by all relevant parties
relating thereto and has no obligation to pay any damages.

 



 

 **Section 12.05.** ** **_Net Losses; Subrogation; Mitigation_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of
any Losses incurred or suffered by an Indemnified Party shall be calculated
after giving effect to (i) any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified
Person (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Losses and (ii) any
recoveries obtained by the Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) from
any other third party. Each Indemnified Party shall exercise reasonable best
efforts to obtain such proceeds, benefits and recoveries. If any such
proceeds, benefits or recoveries are received by an Indemnified Party (or any
of its Affiliates) with respect to any Losses after an Indemnifying Party has
made a payment to the Indemnified Party with respect thereto, the Indemnified
Party (or such Affiliate) shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of
such proceeds, benefits or recoveries (up to the amount of the Indemnifying
Partys payment). With respect to any Losses incurred or suffered by an
Indemnified Party, no liability shall attach to the Indemnifying Party in
respect of any Losses to the extent that the same Losses have been recovered
by the Indemnified Person from the Indemnifying Party, accordingly, the
Indemnified Person may only recover once in respect of the same Loss.

 



 

(b) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses,
the Indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to
all rights of the Indemnified Party (and its Affiliates) against any third
party in respect of the Losses to which such payment relates. Such Indemnified
Party (and its Affiliates) and Indemnifying Party shall execute upon request
all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence or further perfect such
subrogation rights.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Losses,
whether by asserting claims against a third party or by otherwise qualifying
for a benefit that would reduce or eliminate an indemnified matter; _provided_
, _however_ , that no party shall be required to use such efforts if they
would be demonstrably detrimental in any material respect to such party.

 



 

 **Section 12.06.** ** **_Computation of Indemnifiable Losses_. Any
calculation of Losses for purposes of this _Article XII_ shall be (a) reduced
to take account of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified
Party arising from the deductibility of any such Loss in the year such Loss is
incurred; and (b) increased to take account of any net Tax liability actually
realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt or accrual of any
indemnity obligation hereunder. To the extent permitted by law, all indemnity
payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated by the parties
hereto as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



 

 **Section 12.07.** ** **_Exclusive Remedies_. Buyer and Seller acknowledge
and agree that, if the Closing occurs, the indemnification provisions of this
_Article XII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Buyer and Seller
for any breach of the representations or warranties or nonperformance of any
covenants and agreements of Buyer or Seller contained in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and neither party shall have any
liability to the other party under any circumstances for special, indirect,
consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, or lost profits, diminution in
value or any damages based on any type of multiple of earnings of any
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall relieve or limit the liability of either party from any
liability or Losses arising out of or resulting from fraud or intentional
breach in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

 **Section 12.08.** ** **_No Special Damages, Mitigation_. No Indemnifying
Party shall be liable to any Indemnified Party for special, indirect,
consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, or lost profits, diminution in
value or any damages based on any type of multiple of earnings.

 



 

 **Section 12.09.** ** **_Treatment of Indemnity Benefits_. All payments made
by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, to or for the benefit of the other
pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be
treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and such agreed
treatment shall govern for purposes of this Agreement.

any Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the

 **Section 13.06.** ** **_Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Neither party may assign its rights under
this Agreement without the other partys prior written consent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) Buyer may assign its rights hereunder to an affiliate of
Buyer upon written notice to, but without consent of, Seller, provided that
(i) any such assignment does not delay or impede processing of the FCC
Applications, grant of the FCC Consent, clearance or approval under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law or regulation or Closing, (ii) any such
assignee delivers to Seller a written assumption of this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Buyer shall remain liable for all of its obligations hereunder, and (iv)
Buyer shall be solely responsible for any third party consents necessary in
connection therewith (none of which are a condition to Closing; and (b) solely
to the extent set forth in _Section 7.01_, Buyer may assign its right to
purchase the Designated Station Assets, any portion thereof, (and delegate its
duty to assume the Assumed Liabilities corresponding thereto) to a Qualified
Assignee by written notice to, but without consent of, Seller. With respect to
any assignment permitted under this _Section 13.06_, (i) any such assignee,
including a Qualified Assignee, shall deliver to Seller a written instrument
of assumption with respect to this Agreement or the Designated Station Assets,
as applicable, in which such assignee (A) shall make to Seller the
representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ of this Agreement
with respect to such assignee and (B) shall covenant to Seller to observe,
satisfy, discharge and perform the covenants of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement (except, in the case of a Qualified Assignee, to the extent that any
such covenant relates solely to Station Assets other than Designated Station
Assets and the corresponding Assumed Obligations) and (ii) Buyer shall remain
liable for all of its obligations hereunder (including those assigned to such
assignee).

 



 

 **Section 13.07.** ** **_No Recourse_. No past, present or future director,

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including its negotiation
and/or execution.

 



 

 **Section 13.08.** ** **_No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly
provided in _Article IX_, _Article XII_ and _Section 13.06_, this Agreement
is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 13.09.** ** **_Amendments and Waivers_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by an instrument in
writing signed by Newport, High Plains, the FCC Licensee (only to the extent
that any amendment or modification adversely effects the FCC Licensees
obligations under this Agreement) and Buyer.

 



 

(b) At any time prior to the Closing, either party may (i) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other party hereto contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto or (iii) waive compliance by the other party hereto with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to
be bound thereby.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

 



 

 **Section 13.10.** ** **_Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and the negotiation, execution, performance or
nonperformance, interpretation, termination, construction and all matters
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether arising in
law or in equity (collectively, the " _Covered Matters_ "), and all claims or
causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to the Covered Matters, except for documents, agreements and
instruments that specify otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware without giving effect to the choice of law provisions thereof. All
recording matters relating to the conveyance of each parcel of Owned Real
Property will be conducted in conformity with the applicable requirements of
local law governing the location of such parcel.

 



 

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined exclusively in the Delaware Chancery Court, and the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
(and, in the case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any
such Action and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set
forth in this _Section 13.10_ shall not constitute general consents to
service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any
purpose except as provided in this _Section 13.10_ and shall not be deemed to
confer rights on any third party. The parties hereto agree that a final
judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable law.

 



 

 **Section 13.11.** ** **_Specific Performance_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

 **Section 13.12.** ** **_WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,

 



      
 

 



 

PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF BUYER OR SELLER
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

 **Section 13.13.** ** **_Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by facsimile or e-mail shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 13.14.** ** **_No Presumption_. This Agreement shall be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted.

 



 

 **Section 13.15.** ** **_Disclosure Schedules_.

 



 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) matters reflected in the
Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to the matters required by
the Agreement to be disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules, (ii) the Disclosure
Schedules may include certain items and information solely for informational
purposes for the convenience of the parties and (iii) the disclosure by Seller
of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgment by Seller that the matter is required to be disclosed by the
terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material. The specification of
any dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in the
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedules
are not intended to imply that such amounts are within or outside the ordinary
course of business for purposes of the Agreement.

 



 

(b) If and to the extent any information required to be furnished in any
section of the Disclosure Schedules is contained in the Agreement or in any
section of the Disclosure Schedules, such information shall be deemed to be
included in all sections of the Disclosure Schedules to the extent that the
relevance of any such information to any other section of the Disclosure
Schedules is readily apparent from the text of such disclosure.

 



 

(c) Seller has disclosed the information contained in the Disclosure Schedules
solely for purposes of the Agreement, and no information contained therein
shall be deemed to be an admission by any party thereto to any third party of
any matter whatsoever, including of any violation of Law or breach of any
agreement.
