 **PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT**

 



 

This Purchase and Sale Agreement (this " ** _Agreement_** ") is dated as of
May 29, 2015 (the " ** _Execution Date_** "), by and between Bridger, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" ** _Seller_** ") and Ferrellgas
Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" ** _Purchaser_** "). Seller
and Purchaser are sometimes referred to herein individually as a " **
_Party_** " and collectively as the " ** _Parties_**."

 



 

 **RECITALS:**

 



 

A. Seller owns (i) all of the outstanding membership interests (the " **
_Membership Interests_** ") of Bridger Logistics, LLC, a Louisiana limited
liability company (the " ** _Acquired Company_** ") and (ii) directly or
indirectly all of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the " **
_Subsidiary Membership Interests_** ") of each of the Acquired Subsidiaries
(together with the Acquired Company, the " ** _Company Group_** ").

 



 

B. The Acquired Company directly or indirectly owns or as of the Closing Date
will directly or indirectly own all of the issued and outstanding Subsidiary
Membership Interests.

 



 

C. Seller desires to sell, and Purchaser desires to acquire, all of the
Membership Interests upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises and the mutual
promises, representations, warranties, covenants, conditions and agreements
contained herein, and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be
legally bound by the terms hereof, agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE 1 
DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION**

 



 

Section 1.1 _Defined Terms_. In addition to the terms defined in the
introductory paragraph and the Recitals of this Agreement, for purposes
hereof, the capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meanings set forth in _Appendix A_.

 



 

Section 1.2 _References and Rules of Construction_. All references in this
Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Appendices, Articles, Sections, subsections,
clauses and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding Exhibits, Schedules,
Appendices, Articles, Sections, subsections, clauses and other subdivisions of
or to this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at
the beginning of any Exhibits, Schedules, Appendices, Articles, Sections,
subsections, clauses and other subdivisions of this Agreement are for
convenience only, do not constitute any part of this Agreement and shall be
disregarded in construing the language hereof. The words "this Agreement,"
"herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and words of similar import,
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section,
subsection, clause or other subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words
"this Article," "this Section," "this subsection," "this clause," and words of
similar import, refer only to the Article, Section, subsection and clause
hereof in which such words occur. The word "including" (in its various forms)
means including without limitation. All references to "$" or "dollars" shall
be deemed references to United States dollars. Each accounting term not
defined herein will have

      
 

 



 

the meaning given to it under GAAP as interpreted as of the date of this
Agreement. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, the word "or" is not
exclusive. Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be
construed to state and include any other gender, and words, terms and titles
(including terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to
include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires.
Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are attached to and by
this reference incorporated herein for all purposes. Reference herein to any
federal, state, local or foreign Law shall be deemed to also refer to all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. The words "day" or "days" shall mean calendar day, unless denoted
as a Business Day. The words "will" and "will not" are expressions of command
and not merely expressions of future intent or expectation. When used in this
Agreement, the word "either" shall be deemed to mean "one or the other", not
"both". In each instance herein where the phrase "have a Material Adverse
Effect" or similar phrase is used, such phrase shall be deemed to include
"constitute a Material Adverse Effect."

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2 
PURCHASE AND SALE; PURCHASE PRICE**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, Seller shall sell, transfer, assign, convey
and deliver to Purchaser the Membership Interests, and Purchaser shall
purchase, acquire and accept the Membership Interests, in each case free and
clear of Liens (other than Liens arising as a result of applicable state or
federal securities Laws).

 



 

Section 2.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate consideration to be paid by
Purchaser for the Membership Interests (the " ** _Purchase Price_** ") shall
be equal to (i) $562,500,000, (the " ** _Cash Purchase Price_** "), _plus_
(ii) the Aggregate Adjustment as finally determined pursuant to and at the
time provided under _Section 2.4_ (which the Parties agree may be a negative
number), _minus_ (iii) the Seller Portion of the RandW Premium Amount, _plus_
(iv) 11,200,000 LP Units (the " ** _Equity Purchase Price_** "). The Estimated
Cash Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in _Section 8.3(a)_.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Closing Estimates_. At least three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the "
** _Estimated Closing Statement_** ") containing Sellers good faith estimate
of the Estimated Aggregate Adjustment, together with a reasonably detailed
computation of such estimate. Attached hereto as _Schedule 2.3_ is an
illustrative calculation of the Aggregate Adjustment as of the Balance Sheet
Date, as if the Balance Sheet Date was the Closing Date. The Estimated
Aggregate Adjustment shall be prepared in accordance with the illustrative
calculation included on _Schedule 2.3_ using the same methodologies,
practices, policies and judgments as were used in the preparation of the
Financial Statements, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, including _Schedule 2.3_ (the " ** _Accounting Principles_** ").

 



 

Section 2.4 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Reconciliation_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within 60 days thereafter, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a closing
statement (the " ** _Closing_**

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Statement_** "), setting forth Purchasers good faith calculation of the
Aggregate Adjustment. Purchaser shall prepare the Closing Statement and the
Aggregate Adjustment in accordance with the illustrative calculation included
on _Schedule 2.3_ using the Accounting Principles.

 



 

(b) Within 30 days after Sellers receipt of the Closing Statement, Seller
shall notify Purchaser in writing whether Seller agrees or disagrees with the
Closing Statement. If Purchaser does not receive such notice within such
30-day period, it shall be deemed that Seller has accepted the Closing
Statement with respect to all items set forth therein as of the expiration of
such 30-day period. If Seller accepts (or is deemed to accept, as provided in
the immediately preceding sentence) the Closing Statement, Purchaser or
Seller, as appropriate, shall, within five Business Days of such acceptance
(or deemed acceptance), make the following adjustments: (i) if the Aggregate
Adjustment is $1,000,000 greater than the Estimated Aggregate Adjustment,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller the full amount by which the Aggregate
Adjustment exceeds the Estimated Aggregate Adjustment in cash (by means of
federal funds wire or interbank transfer in immediately available funds) or
(ii) if the Aggregate Adjustment is $1,000,000 less than the Estimated
Aggregate Adjustment, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the full amount by which
the Aggregate Adjustment is less than the Estimated Aggregate Adjustment in LP
Units, valued at $24.55 per LP Unit; _provided_ , that any Retention Bonus
Amounts shall not be subject to the $1,000,000 threshold described in clause
(ii). In the event that any payment required by this _Section 2.4(b)_ is not
made by the appropriate Party when due pursuant to the terms of this _Section
2.4(b)_, such payment shall accrue interest from the date such payment was due
at the lesser of (A) 5% per annum and (B) the maximum rate permitted by
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) If Seller disagrees with Purchasers calculation of the Aggregate
Adjustment set forth in the Closing Statement, each notice delivered by or on
behalf of Seller pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ (a " ** _Seller Notice of
Disagreement_** ") shall specify Sellers calculation of the Aggregate
Adjustment and shall specify in reasonable detail the items or amounts as to
which Seller disagrees and the nature and extent of such disagreement. Seller
shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in
the Closing Statement and the Aggregate Adjustment. Purchaser and Seller shall
have a period of 30 days from Purchasers receipt of a Seller Notice of
Disagreement to resolve any disagreement specified therein. Any disputed
amounts that cannot be agreed to by the Parties within 30 days after
Purchasers receipt of a Seller Notice of Disagreement shall be determined by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, (the " ** _Accounting Firm_** "). The engagement
of and the determination by the Accounting Firm (or any other accounting firm
designated by the Accounting Firm as set forth below) shall be completed
within 60 days after such assignment is given to the Accounting Firm and shall
be final and binding on, and non-appealable by, Seller and Purchaser. If for
any reason the Accounting Firm is unable to act in such capacity, such
determination will be made by any other nationally recognized accounting firm
selected by the Accounting Firm, which other accounting firm does not have a
material relationship with either Seller or Purchaser. Purchaser agrees that
it will cause each member of the Company Group to promptly provide reasonable
access to its books, records, supporting documents, work papers and personnel
to Seller and its Representatives (including the Accounting Firm) at
reasonable times in connection with any dispute under this _Section 2.4(c)_,
and Purchaser and Seller agree that they will use their Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cause their respective independent accountants to
cooperate and assist in the preparation of the conduct of the audits and
reviews referred to in this _Section 2.4(c)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the access Purchaser is obligated to cause to be provided

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder shall not be construed to cause any member of the Company Group or
Purchaser to take any action that could adversely affect the attorney-client
privilege (or any similar privilege). The fees and expenses payable to the
Accounting Firm (or any other accounting firm designated by the Accounting
Firm) in connection with determining the difference, if any, in the Aggregate
Adjustment set forth in the Closing Statement as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 2.4(c)_ (the " ** _Final Adjustment Amount_** ") shall be
split equally between Purchaser and Seller.

 



 

(d) Within five Business Days of the date on which the last disputed item
required to determine the Final Adjustment Amount is resolved by the
Accounting Firm, Purchaser or Seller, as appropriate, shall make the payments
described in _Section 2.4(b)_ hereof.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SELLER**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Generally_.

 



 

(a) Inclusion of a matter on a Schedule in relation to a representation or
warranty that addresses matters having a Material Adverse Effect shall not be
deemed an indication that such matter does, or may, have a Material Adverse
Effect. Likewise, the inclusion of a matter on a Schedule to this Agreement in
relation to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an indication
that such matter necessarily would, or may, breach such representation or
warranty absent its inclusion on such Schedule. Matters may be disclosed on a
Schedule for information purposes only.

 



 

(b) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 3.1_, the
disclaimers and waivers contained in and the other terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser as of the date

Membership Interests, free and clear of all Liens, other than (i) Liens that
will be released at or before Closing and (ii) restrictions on transfer that
may be imposed by federal or state securities Laws or the Governing Documents
of the Company Group. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Purchaser will acquire good, valid, and marketable title to all of the
Membership Interests and all of the Subsidiary Membership Interests, free and
clear of all Liens, other than Liens that may arise by virtue of any actions
taken by or on behalf of Purchaser or its Affiliates. The Membership Interests
constitute 100% of the Equity Securities in the Acquired Company, and the
Subsidiary Membership Interests constitute 100% of the Equity Securities in
the Acquired Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Existence and Qualification_. Seller is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Authorization and Enforceability_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and all documents required to be executed and
delivered by or on behalf of Seller on or prior to Closing, and the
performance of the transactions contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

hereby and thereby, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
limited liability company or similar action on the part of Seller. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of Seller (and
all documents required hereunder to be executed and delivered by or on behalf
of Seller at or prior to Closing will be duly executed and delivered by or on
behalf of Seller) and this Agreement (assuming that this Agreement constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser) constitutes, and at the
Closing such documents will constitute, the valid and binding obligations of
Seller, enforceable in accordance with their terms except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy or other similar Laws
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, as well as by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

Section 3.5 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and all documents required to be executed and delivered by or on
behalf of Seller and the transactions contemplated herein and therein, will
not (a) violate any provision of the Governing Documents of Seller, (b) result
in default (with due notice or lapse of time or both) or the creation of any
material Lien or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, license or agreement to which Seller is a party,
(c) violate any Laws applicable to Seller as a party in interest or otherwise,
except any matters described in clauses (b) or (c) above that would not
materially and adversely affect Sellers ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened before any Governmental Body or arbitrator
against Seller that are reasonably likely to materially impair Sellers
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any document
required to be executed and delivered by or on behalf of Seller on or prior to
the Closing.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Liability for Brokers  Fees_. Neither Purchaser nor any member
of the Company Group shall directly or indirectly have any responsibility,
liability or expense, as a result of undertakings or agreements of Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller, in each case, for Transaction Expenses, brokerage
fees, finders fees, agents commissions or other similar forms of
compensation in connection with this Agreement or any agreement or transaction
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Approvals_. Except in connection with the HSR Act or as set forth
in _Schedule 3.8_, no consent, approval, order, or authorization of, or
declaration, filing, or registration with, any Governmental Body or any Third
Party, in each case, that is material to the Business, is required to be
obtained or made by Seller in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement, each other agreement, instrument or document
executed by Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby to
which it is a party or the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

Section 3.9 _Investment Intent; No Reliance_. Seller is acquiring the LP Units
comprising the Equity Purchase Price (the " ** _LP Consideration Units_** ")
for its own account, for the purpose of investment only and not with a view
to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of
applicable securities Laws. In determining whether to execute,

 



      
 

 



 

deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement, Seller has not
relied on any representations or warranties of the Purchaser or any Affiliate,
agent or representative of Purchaser of any kind or character, except the
representations and warranties specifically set forth in this Agreement.
Seller has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so
as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
LP Consideration Units and is capable of bearing the economic risk of such
investment. Seller is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D (without regard to Rule 501(a)(4)) promulgated under the
Securities Act. Seller is acquiring the LP Consideration Units for investment
for its own account and not with a view toward or for sale in connection with
any distribution thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or
selling the LP Consideration Units. Seller does not have any contract or
arrangement with any Person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such
Person or to any third Person, with respect to the LP Consideration Units.
Seller acknowledges and understands that (a) the acquisition of the LP
Consideration Units has not been registered under the Securities Act in
reliance on an exemption therefrom and (b) the LP Consideration Units will,
upon such acquisition, be characterized as "restricted securities" under state
and federal securities Laws. Seller further acknowledges and understands that
the LP Consideration Units may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale,
pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an available
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in
compliance with other applicable state and federal securities Laws.

REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, AND (II) SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY STATEMENT OR
INFORMATION MADE OR COMMUNICATED (ORALLY OR IN WRITING) TO PURCHASER OR ANY OF

 **ARTICLE 4 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE COMPANY GROUP**

 



 

Subject to the provisions of _Section 3.1(a)_, the disclaimers and waivers
contained in and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller
hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as of the date hereof and as of
the Closing the matters set out in _Section 4.1_ through _Section 4.19_.

 



 

Section 4.1 _Existence and Qualification_. The Acquired Company is a limited
liability company, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Louisiana, and has all requisite limited liability company power and
authority to conduct the Business as it is now being conducted and to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets where such properties and assets
are now owned, leased or operated. The Acquired Company is duly qualified to
do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing (to the extent
applicable) under the Laws of

 



      
 

 



 

each state or other jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the
assets owned or used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by it,
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in those jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not constitute a
Material Adverse Effect. Seller has previously delivered to Purchaser true,
correct and complete copies of the Governing Documents for the Acquired
Company.

 



 

Section 4.2 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Seller, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will
not (a) violate any provision of the Acquired Companys Governing Documents or
of the Governing Documents of any of the Acquired Subsidiaries, (b) assuming
all of the consents set forth on _Schedule 4.2_ have been obtained (the " **
_Company Consents_** "), result in a violation or the creation of any Lien, or
a breach of or default (or give rise to any material right of termination,
cancellation, amendment, modification, or acceleration) under any Company
Contract, (c) assuming the Company Consents have been obtained, require the
consent or approval of any Governmental Body, or notice to, or declaration,
filing or registration with, any Governmental Body, under any applicable Law,
or (d) violate any Laws applicable to the Acquired Company or any of the
Acquired Subsidiaries, except any matters described in _clause (b)_ above
that would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Capitalization_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_, Seller
is the direct owner, holder of record, and beneficial owner of the Membership
Interests free and clear of all Liens, restrictions on transfer or other
encumbrances other than Liens that will be released at or before Closing,
those arising pursuant to or expressly contemplated in this Agreement, the
Governing Documents of the Acquired Company, applicable securities Laws or as
a result of Purchasers acquisition of the Membership Interests, including
financings related to such acquisition and, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, none of the Membership Interests are subject to any voting
trust, member agreement or voting agreement or other agreement, right,
instrument or understanding with respect to any purchase, sale, issuance,
transfer, repurchase, redemption or voting of any Equity Securities of the
Acquired Company, other than the Governing Documents of the Acquired Company.
When transferred to Purchaser at Closing, the Membership Interests will be
owned by Purchaser free and clear of all Liens other than those arising
pursuant to the Governing Documents of the Acquired Company, applicable
securities Laws or as a result of Purchasers acquisition of the Membership
Interests, including financings related thereto. The Membership Interests are
duly authorized and validly issued, non-assessable (subject to the terms of
the Governing Documents of the Acquired Company and the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act) and constitute all of the outstanding Equity Securities
of the Acquired Company. The Acquired Company has not granted to any Person
any agreement or option, or any right or privilege capable of becoming an
agreement or option, for the purchase, subscription, allotment or issue of any
unissued interests, units or other securities (including convertible
securities or warrants) of the Acquired Company. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Acquired Company to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Equity Security.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Subsidiaries_. Each Acquired Subsidiary is a limited liability
company, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite power and authority
to conduct its Business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and
operate the assets of the Business where such assets are now

 



      
 

 



 

owned or used by it, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals the absence of which would not be material to any of
the Acquired Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each Acquired Subsidiary is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing (to the
extent applicable) under the Laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which
either the ownership or use of the assets owned or used by it, or the nature
of the activities conducted by it, makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
or licensed would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect. Each Acquired
Subsidiary (including the amount or percentage of the Acquired Companys
direct or indirect ownership in each Acquired Subsidiary) and its respective
jurisdiction of organization and qualification is identified on _Schedule
4.4_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.4_, the Acquired Company and the
Acquired Subsidiaries do not, directly or indirectly, own any Equity
Securities in any other Person.

 



 

(a) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 4.4_, all of Subsidiary Membership
Interests are owned by the Acquired Company, directly or indirectly, free and
clear of all Liens other than Liens that will be released at or before
Closing, Liens arising under the Governing Documents of the Acquired
Subsidiary or applicable securities Laws. Except as disclosed in _Schedule
4.4_, none of the Acquired Subsidiaries have granted to any Person any
agreement or option, or any right or privilege capable of becoming an
agreement or option, for the purchase, subscription, allotment or issue of any
unissued interests, units or other securities (including convertible
securities or warrants) of such Subsidiary. All Subsidiary Membership
Interests have been duly authorized and validly issued and were not issued in
violation of, or (except as disclosed in _Schedule 4.4_) subject to, any
preemptive rights or preferential rights of subscription or purchase of any
other Person.

 



 

(b) None of the Subsidiary Membership Interests are subject to any voting
trust, member or partnership agreement or voting agreement or other agreement,
right, instrument or understanding with respect to any purchase, sale,
issuance, transfer, repurchase, redemption or voting of any Subsidiary
Membership Interests, other than the Governing Documents of the Acquired
Subsidiaries or as set forth on _Schedule 4.4_. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
Subsidiary Membership Interests. The Subsidiary Membership Interests
constitute 100% of the Equity Securities in the Acquired Subsidiaries.

described in the footnotes to the Financial Statements, no Proceedings are
pending against, and there are no outstanding Governmental Orders to which the
Acquired Company or an Acquired Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound,
and to the Knowledge of Seller, no such Proceedings or Governmental Orders
have been threatened against the Acquired Company or any of the Acquired
Subsidiaries, that would be material to the Company Group, taken as a whole.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Financial Statements_. Seller has previously delivered to
Purchaser (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet for the Pre-
Reorganization Company Group as of the Balance Sheet Date (the " ** _Balance

and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes
in equity for the Pre-Reorganization Company Group for the years ended
December 31, 2012, December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, as applicable (the
" ** _Year-End Financial Statements_** " and, together with the Interim

Statements are attached hereto as _Exhibit A_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.6_, the Financial Statements (i) are true, correct and complete
and (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present in all
material respects the assets, liabilities, results of operations, cash flows

practices affecting the Company Group, except as required or permitted by GAAP

Acquired Subsidiaries have been timely filed, taking into account all
permitted extensions and such Tax Returns are correct and complete in all
respects, (b) all Taxes due and payable by the Acquired Company or any of the
Acquired Subsidiaries have been paid in full, except for amounts that are

statutes of limitations have been given or requested in writing with respect
to Taxes of the Acquired Company or any of the Acquired Subsidiaries or any
Tax Returns of the Acquired Company or the Acquired Subsidiaries for which
waivers or extensions are currently in effect, (d) neither the Acquired
Company nor any of the Acquired Subsidiaries has any liability for the Taxes

purposes and (ii) has been treated as a disregarded entity or partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes since the time of its formation.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except as set forth in _Schedule
4.9_, the Acquired Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries are and since January
1, 2012, have been in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Laws, and neither Seller, the Acquired Company or any Acquired Subsidiary has
received any written notice (or to the Knowledge of Seller, any other notice)
from any Governmental Body or any other Person that the Acquired Company or
any Acquired Subsidiary is in material violation of, or has materially
violated, any Laws. On the Closing Date, the Acquired Company and the Acquired
Subsidiaries will have, in effect all material Permits reasonably necessary to
carry on the Business, as now conducted, including those Permits that are
listed on _Schedule 4.9_ (such Permits listed on _Schedule 4.9_ being the "
** _Material Permits_** "), and there has occurred no uncured default under
any Material Permit, except for such failures to be in full force and effect
or non-compliance as would not be material to the Company Group, taken as a
whole. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller nor the
consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in
a material violation or material breach of, or constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) a material default (or give rise to a right
of termination or cancellation) of any Material Permit. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this _Section 4.9_ does not relate to Taxes (which are addressed
exclusively in _Section 4.8_) or Permits required under Environmental Laws,

$500,000;

 



 

(vii) any Contract that expressly limits, impedes, interferes with or
restricts the ability of the Acquired Company or any Acquired Subsidiary (A)

may be, has performed all material obligations required to have been performed
and is not in material breach or material default under the respective Company
Contracts and Bridger Group Contracts, and to Sellers Knowledge, no other
Person is in material breach or material default under any Company Contract.
Seller has delivered to Purchaser true, complete and correct copies of all of
the Company Contracts and Bridger Group Contracts, together with all
amendments, modifications or supplements thereto. No party to any Company

respect to any Company Contract or Bridger Group Contract.

Seller, since January 1, 2014, no material written environmental reports have
been in the possession of Seller, the Acquired Company and or an Acquired
Subsidiary, that have not been made available to Purchaser prior to the date
hereof, excluding any such reports combining information, the disclosure of
which would constitute a waiver of attorney-client privilege or a waiver of
rights as to attorney work product, provided that all such excluded reports
shall be listed on _Schedule 4.11(b)_.

 



 

(c) The representations and warranties provided in this _Section 4.11_
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of Seller in

as presently conducted, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements
governing the use of the same, which limitations are customary for companies

 **ARTICLE 5 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER**

 



 

Subject to the provisions of _Section 3.1(a)_ and the disclaimers and waivers

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware.
Purchaser is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good
standing (to the extent applicable) under the Laws of each state or other
jurisdiction where the actions to be performed by each of them, as applicable,
hereunder makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in those

ability to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in a timely manner.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and all documents required to be executed and

required hereunder to be executed and delivered by or on behalf of Purchaser,
at Closing will be duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of Purchaser)
and this Agreement (assuming that this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligations of Seller) constitutes, and at the Closing such
documents will constitute, the valid and binding obligations of Purchaser,
enforceable in accordance with their terms except as such enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy or other similar Laws affecting the rights
and remedies of creditors generally, as well as by general principles of
equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). At the Closing, the Registration Rights
Agreement (assuming that it constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Seller) will constitute a valid and binding obligation on Purchaser,
enforceable in accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 5.3 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and all documents required to be executed and delivered by or on
behalf of Purchaser, and the transactions contemplated by herein and therein,
will not (a) violate any provision of the Governing Documents of Purchaser,

creation of any Lien or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license or agreement to which Purchaser is a
party, (c) violate any judgment, order, ruling, or decree by which Purchaser
is bound, or (d) assuming any applicable requirements under the HSR Act have
been met, violate any Laws applicable to Purchaser.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Liability for Brokers  Fees_. Seller shall not directly or
indirectly have any responsibility, liability or expense, as a result of

agents commissions or other similar forms of compensation in connection with
this Agreement or any agreement or transaction contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened before any Governmental Body or arbitrator
against Purchaser that are reasonably likely to materially impair Purchasers
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any document
required to be executed and delivered by or on behalf of Purchaser at Closing.

Securities Act or an exemption therefrom.

accredited investor as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act.

Act, and Purchaser is acquiring the Membership Interests for its own account

compliance with applicable federal and state securities Laws, nor with any
present intention of distributing or selling any of the Membership Interests.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Independent Evaluation_. Purchaser is an experienced and
knowledgeable investor in the business of owning and operating assets used in
the crude oil transportation and logistics services business and is aware of
the risks of such business. Purchaser has had access to the assets of the
Business, the officers, consultants and other Representatives of the Acquired
Company, Acquired Subsidiaries, Seller and Sellers Affiliates, and the Books
and Records. In making the decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser has relied and will
rely solely on (i) the basis of its own independent due diligence
investigation of the Business and the provisions of this Agreement, and (ii)
the representations and warranties made by Seller in _Article 3_ and _Article
4_ or any other document required to be executed and delivered by or on behalf
of Seller.

under this Agreement or any document required to be executed and delivered by
or on behalf of Purchaser at Closing.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Equity Consideration_.

issued in accordance with applicable Law and the Governing Documents of
Purchaser and will be fully paid and non-assessable (subject to applicable
Law). At Closing, Seller will acquire good, valid, and marketable title to all
of the LP Units, free and clear of all Liens, other than Liens that may arise
by virtue of any actions taken by or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates,
Liens arising under the Governing Documents of Purchaser or Liens arising
under applicable securities Laws. The LP Units comprising the Equity Purchase
Price will not be issued in violation of any pre-emptive right or option, or
any right or privilege capable of becoming an agreement or option, for the
purchase or subscription of such LP Units.

 



 

(b) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Governing
Documents of the Purchaser: (i) none of the LP Units comprising the Equity

worth with respect to), any of such LP Units.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Governing Documents_. True, correct and complete copies of the
Governing Documents of Purchaser as in effect on the date hereof have been

(a) Since December 31, 2012, all reports, including but not limited to the
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the
Current Reports on Form 8-K, forms, schedules, statements and other documents
required to be filed or furnished by Purchaser with or to the SEC, as
applicable, pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (the " **
_Purchaser SEC Documents_** "), have been timely filed or furnished in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. All such Purchaser SEC
Documents, as of their respective filing dates in the case of any Exchange Act
report and as of their respective effective dates in the case of any
Securities Act filing, (i) did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii) complied as
to form in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Purchaser has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Purchasers disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by Purchaser in the reports that it files
under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to Purchasers
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions. To the Knowledge of
Purchaser, since September 30, 2013, there have not been any material
weaknesses in Purchasers internal control over financial reporting or changes
in Purchasers internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to materially adversely affect Purchasers internal control over
financial reporting.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Financial Statements_. The historical financial statements of

related notes and schedules (the " ** _Purchaser Financial Statements_** "):
(i) comply as to form in all material respects with Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act; (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position as of the date thereof, and results of operations, cash
flows and changes in partners equity of the entities to which such Purchaser
Financial Statements relate, on the basis set forth therein and as of and for
the periods indicated; and (iii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X) and subject, in the
case of interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments.

 



 

Section 5.16 _MLP Status_. Purchaser is properly treated as a partnership for
United States federal income tax purposes and more than ninety percent (90%)
of Purchasers current gross income is qualifying income under Section 7704(d)
of the Code. Purchaser is not, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a
partnership that would be treated as an investment company (within the meaning
of Section 351 of the Code) if Purchaser were incorporated.

SET FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE 5_ OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT REQUIRED TO BE EXECUTED
AND DELIVERED BY OR ON BEHALF OF PURCHASER, (I) PURCHASER MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, AND (II)
PURCHASER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY
STATEMENT OR INFORMATION MADE OR COMMUNICATED (ORALLY OR IN WRITING) TO SELLER
OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR REPRESENTATIVES
(INCLUDING ANY OPINION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO

and its Representatives, upon reasonable advance notice to Seller or its
Representatives, reasonable access to the Business and reasonable access to
and the right to copy, at Purchasers sole cost, risk and expense, the Books
and Records (or originals thereof), for the purpose of conducting a reasonable
due diligence review of the Acquired Company, the Acquired Subsidiaries and
the Business, but only to the extent that Seller and the Acquired Company may
do so without violating any obligations to any Third Party and to the extent
that Seller and the Acquired Company have the authority to grant such access
without breaching any restrictions binding on them, in each case, as
determined by Seller in its reasonable discretion; provided that Seller shall
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause such Third Party to agree to
permit Seller to provide such access to Purchaser and its Representatives.
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, abide by Sellers and
the Acquired Companys safety rules, regulations, and operating policies while
conducting its due diligence evaluation of the Acquired Company, the Acquired
Subsidiaries and the Business. Any conclusions made from any examination done
by Purchaser shall result from Purchasers own independent review and
judgment; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Purchaser nor its
Representatives shall conduct any environmental site assessment, compliance
evaluation or investigation with respect to Seller, the Acquired Company, the
Acquired Subsidiaries or the Business without prior written consent of Seller
and without reasonable ongoing consultation with Seller with respect to any
such activity (it being understood and agreed that in no event shall any
subsurface investigation or testing of any environmental media be conducted
(i) on the Owned Real Property without Sellers prior consent, which shall not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed and (ii) on any other
properties of the Company Group or related to the Business other than the
Owned Real Property).

 



 

(b) The access granted to Purchaser under this _Section 6.1_ shall be limited
to the Acquired Companys normal business hours, and Purchasers investigation
shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes interference with the operation
of the Acquired Company, the Acquired Subsidiaries and the Business. Purchaser
shall coordinate its access rights with the Acquired Company to reasonably
minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of the Business.
Purchaser also agrees that neither Purchaser nor its Representatives shall
contact any of the employees, customers, suppliers or parties that have
business relationships with Seller, the Acquired Company or any Acquired
Subsidiary, nor any Governmental Body or representatives thereof, in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in person or by
telephone, email or other means of communication, without prior written
consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed.

 



 

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access, Purchaser
will become privy to confidential and other information of Seller, the
Acquired Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries and that such confidential
information (which includes Purchasers conclusions with respect to its
evaluations) shall be held confidential by Purchaser in accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and any applicable privacy
Laws regarding personal information.

 



 

(d) In connection with the rights of access, examination and inspection
granted to Purchaser under this _Section 6.1_, **PURCHASER HEREBY AGREES TO
INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS THE ACQUIRED COMPANY AND THE SELLER GROUP
FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL DAMAGES ATTRIBUTABLE TO PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH OR
PHYSICAL PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR VIOLATION OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY S RULES,
REGULATIONS, OR OPERATING POLICIES, ARISING OUT OF, RESULTING FROM OR RELATING
TO ANY FIELD VISIT OR OTHER DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITY CONDUCTED BY PURCHASER WITH
RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS**.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Government Reviews_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable, Seller and Purchaser shall (a) make all
required filings, prepare all required applications and conduct negotiations
with each Governmental Body as to which such filings, applications or
negotiations are necessary or appropriate in the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (b) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to provide such information as each may reasonably request to make such
filings, prepare such applications and conduct such negotiations. Each Party
shall reasonably cooperate with and use all Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
assist the other with respect to such filings, applications, and negotiations.
Each Party shall promptly inform the other Parties of any oral communication,
and upon request provide copies of written communications, with any
Governmental Body regarding any such filings. No Party shall independently
participate in any formal meeting or substantive discussion with any
Governmental Body in respect of any such filings or other inquiry without
giving the other Parties prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate. Any Party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this _Section 6.2_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
of such Party and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of such Party, unless express written permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_,
as soon as practicable, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days after
the date of execution of this Agreement, Parties shall file or cause to be
filed with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of
Justice any notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and in each case, shall request early
termination of the waiting period with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein. The Parties shall consult with each other as to the
appropriate time for filing such notifications and shall agree upon the timing
of such filings, and to respond promptly to any requests for additional
information made by either of such agencies. Purchaser shall pay all filing
fees under the HSR Act, but Seller shall bear its own costs for the
preparation of any filing. The Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to cause any waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein to expire or terminate at the earliest
possible

 



      
 

 



 

time. The Purchaser will not withdraw its initial filing under the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Law, as the case may be, and refile it unless Seller has
consented in advance to such withdrawal and refiling.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith with the Antitrust Authorities and
as promptly as possible, use good faith efforts to complete lawfully the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable (but in any
event prior to the date set forth in _Section 9.1(d)_) the actions necessary
or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened
commencement of any Proceeding by or on behalf of any Antitrust Authority or
the issuance of any Governmental Order that would delay, enjoin, prevent,
restrain or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting this _Section 6.2(c)_
Purchaser agrees, in connection with the matters covered by this _Section
6.2_, to commence and/or defend against litigation in order to seek to prevent
an issuance of a Governmental Order that would prohibit the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary provided herein, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
shall be required, in connection with the matters covered by this _Section
6.2_, to (i) pay any material amounts (excluding legal fees and expenses that
would be incurred in connection with the performance of the covenant of
Purchaser in the immediately preceding sentence), (ii) hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of its or its Affiliates
businesses, product lines or assets, or any of the properties or assets of the
Company Group, (iii) agree to any material limitation on the operation or
conduct of the Business, or (iv) waive any of the conditions to this Agreement
set forth in _Section 7.3_.

 



 

(d) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Purchaser and Seller shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to the Purchaser, Seller or the Acquired Company, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Body in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing rights, each of the Acquired Company, Seller and Purchaser shall
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Public Announcements; Confidentiality_. The initial press release
with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release
to be reasonably agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser. Thereafter, no Party
shall make any press release or other public announcement (to the extent not
previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to
this Agreement, the contents hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not restrict disclosures (i) to the extent required
(upon advice of counsel) by applicable securities or other Laws or regulations
or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the
Parties or their respective Affiliates, (ii) of the terms of this Agreement by
Seller to its Representatives or (iii) to the extent such Party has been given
a reasonable opportunity to review such disclosure prior to its release and no
objection is raised.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Conduct and Preservation of Business_. Except as expressly
provided in this Agreement or as consented to in writing by Purchaser (the
requirement of which will not

 



      
 

 



 

violate or conflict with applicable Law), between the Execution Date and the
earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1_, Seller will cause the Acquired Company and the
Acquired Subsidiaries to (i) conduct their operations according to their
ordinary course of business and in material compliance with all applicable
Laws and (ii) maintain and preserve intact the Business in all material
respects with a view toward preserving the Business for Purchaser to and after
the Closing Date; _provided_ that, the Acquired Company, the Acquired
Subsidiaries, Seller and Sellers Affiliates shall not be required to (x) make
any capital expenditures or (y) make any payment or assume any liability or
obligation not otherwise required to be paid or assumed by the terms of an
existing Company Contract or by applicable Law or offer or grant any financial
accommodation or other benefit not otherwise required to be made by the terms
of an existing Contract.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Restrictions on Certain Actions_. Without limiting the generality
of _Section 6.4_, and except (A) as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement
(including as described on _Schedule 6.5_) or (B) as required by applicable
Law, between the Execution Date and the earlier of the Closing Date and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1_, Seller will

accounting for Tax purposes if such change could directly or indirectly affect
Purchaser, or (ii) prepare or file any Tax Return (or any amendment,
modification or supplement thereof) unless such Tax Return shall have been
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice or Seller has provided

delayed);

and shall notify Purchaser of such action promptly thereafter.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Amendment to Schedules_. Each Party agrees that, with respect to
the representations and warranties of such Party contained in this Agreement,
such Party shall have the continuing right until three Business Days before
Closing to supplement or amend the Schedules relating to such representations
and warranties, subject to the following:

 



 

(a) if such amendment or supplement is based on events or matters that (i)
arose before the date of this Agreement or (ii) arise after the date of this
Agreement and that are not expressly permitted to occur under the terms of
this Agreement, in each case, no such amendment or supplement shall be given
effect for purposes of determining (x) the fulfillment of any condition
precedent set forth in _Article 7_ or (y) the failure of any representation
or warranty to be true and correct; and

 



 

(b) if such amendment or supplement is based on events or matters that arise
after the date of this Agreement and that are expressly permitted to occur
under the terms of this Agreement, such amendment or supplement shall be
immediately effective and the amended or supplemented Schedule shall be read
for all purposes as so amended or supplemented.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party hereto
will use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable
under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be
required to take or cause to be taken any action, or to do or cause to be done
anything, contemplated by this Agreement to be taken or done or caused to be
taken or done by the other party hereto or its Affiliate.

 



 

(b) After Closing, the Parties agree to take such further actions and to
execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further documents as are reasonably
requested by the other Party for carrying out the purposes of this Agreement
or any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including all agreements
to be executed by the Parties in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, after
Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Company to, give Seller
reasonable access to the Books and Records (or originals thereof) for the
purpose of reviewing the methodologies, practices, policies and judgments
Purchaser used to prepare the Closing Statement.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Commitment Regarding Indemnification Provisions_. Purchaser
covenants and agrees that during the period that commences on the Closing Date
and ends on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
not cause any amendment, modification, waiver or termination of any provision
of the Governing Documents of the Acquired Company or any

 



      
 

 



 

Acquired Subsidiary setting forth exculpation from liability or rights to
indemnification for officers, directors, managers or members of the Acquired
Company or such Acquired Subsidiary, the effect of which would be to affect
adversely the rights of any person serving as an officer, director, manager or
member of the Acquired Company or an Acquired Subsidiary, existing as of the
date of this Agreement under such provisions; _provided, however_ , that the
foregoing restriction shall not apply to any such amendment, modification,
waiver or termination to the extent required to cause such provisions (or any
portion thereof) to comply with applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller will use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to transfer the employment of each Transfer Employee from the
applicable member of the Bridger Group to the Acquired Company or one of the
Acquired Subsidiaries. Such transfers of employment shall result in the
termination of employment of such Transfer Employees from the Bridger Group
and shall become effective at 12:01 am on the Closing Date or at such earlier
time as Seller may determine in its discretion. The parties intend that each
Transfer Employees transfer of employment from the Bridger Group to the
Acquired Company or one of the Acquired Subsidiaries shall not constitute a
separation, termination or severance of employment, including for purposes of
any Employee Plan that provides for separation, termination or severance
benefits, and that each such Transfer Employee will have continuous and
uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the
transfer. Without limiting the other provisions of this _Section 6.9_, such
transfers of employment shall result in the assumption by the Acquired Company
of all liabilities of the Bridger Group related to the Transfer Employees to
the extent incurred in the ordinary course of business (including accrued but
unused vacation or other paid-time off of Transfer Employees) and including **
** liabilities for accrued salaries and wages and other payables to Insperity
PEO Services, L.P. with respect to the Transfer Employees ( **" _Transfer
Employee Liabilities_ "**). The Seller and Purchaser agree that following the
Closing, the Acquired Company or one of the Acquired Subsidiaries will be
responsible for and will indemnify and hold harmless Seller for and against
all Transfer Employee Liabilities. The Parties expressly acknowledge that the
Transfer Employee Liabilities include the retention bonus and severance
obligations for the Business Employees under those certain "Transaction Bonus
and Severance Agreement" letters delivered by the Seller to certain Business
Employees on or around April 27, 2015.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall give the Business Employees
who are in the employ of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company Group) following the Closing Date (" ** _Continuing Employees_** ")
full credit for all purposes under any employee benefit plans, arrangements
and employment-related entitlements (including under any applicable 401(k),
savings, medical, dental, life insurance, vacation or other leave
entitlements, plans or arrangements) that are provided, sponsored, maintained
or contributed to by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for such Continuing
Employees service with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and with any
predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company Group prior to the Closing), except to the
extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same
period of service. Purchaser and Seller agree to cooperate and exchange such
information as is reasonably necessary to avoid any such duplication of
benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted under
applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Law, Purchaser shall not be required to provide credit for such service for
benefit accrual purposes under any employee benefit plan of Purchaser that is
a defined benefit pension plan.

 



 

(c) Purchaser agrees that during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the one year anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall provide (or
cause its Affiliates to provide) Continuing Employees with compensation,
benefits and perquisites and other terms and conditions of employment that
are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the compensation, benefits
and perquisites and other terms and conditions of employment provided to such
employees immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive for each
Continuing Employee and his or her dependents, any waiting period provision,
payment requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing condition
limitation, actively-at-work requirement and any other restriction that would
prevent immediate or full participation under the welfare plans of Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent
such waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work
requirement or other restriction would not have been applicable to such
Continuing Employee under the terms of corresponding Employee Plan, and (ii)
give full credit under the welfare plans of Purchaser and its Affiliates
applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-
payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year
as the Closing, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single
continuous employer.

 



 

(e) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in communications with Continuing
Employees with respect to employee benefit plans and with respect to other
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, until the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall consult with Seller and obtain Sellers consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before distributing any
communications to any employees, whether relating to employee benefits, terms
of employment or otherwise and shall provide Seller with advance copies of,
and a reasonable opportunity to comment on (and shall consider in good faith
all such comments), all material communications to any employee relating to
post-Closing employment, employee benefits, terms of employment or otherwise.

 



 

(f) Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this
_Section 6.9_ shall be construed to limit in any way the ability of Purchaser
or its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee from
and after the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) Without limiting the generality of _Section 12.10_, nothing in this
_Section 6.9_, express or implied, is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities under this Agreement upon any
Person (including any Continuing Employees) other than the Parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and assigns to continued employment
or any severance or other benefits from Seller, Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.9_ shall be
construed as an amendment to any Employee Plan or employee benefit plan.
Subject to applicable Law, unless otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, including this _Section 6.9_, no provision of this Agreement shall
constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify or terminate, either before
or after Closing, any employee benefit plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Purchaser shall provide any notices to the Continuing Employees that may
be required under any applicable Law, including the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (" ** _WARN_** ") or any similar Law, with
respect to events that occur from and after the Closing. Purchaser shall not
take any action after the Closing that would cause any termination of
employment of any employees by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that occurs
on or before the Closing to constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
under WARN or any similar Law, or to create any Liability to Seller or any of
its Affiliates for any employment terminations under applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) As a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, Seller
and its controlled Affiliates shall not, for a period of four (4) years after
the Closing Date, directly or indirectly through any Person, own, acquire,
manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of any Person engaged in any business that otherwise
competes with the Business, anywhere in the United States; _provided_ ,
however, that in no event shall crude oil marketing activities be considered a
business that competes with the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Bridger Group may, without violating this _Section 6.10_, own a passive
investment not in excess of 5% of the outstanding capital stock of a
corporation which engages in such a business, if such capital stock is a
security actively traded on an established securities exchange.

 



 

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months from and after the Closing Date, (i)
Purchaser, its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors or
employees shall not (A) induce or attempt to induce any director, officer or
employee of any member of the Bridger Group to leave the employ of such member
of the Bridger Group or (B) in any other way intentionally interfere with the
relationship between any member of the Bridger Group and any employee, officer
or director thereof; _provided,_ however, that the foregoing shall not be
applicable to the Continuing Employees and (ii) the Bridger Group, its
Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors or employees
shall not (A) induce or attempt to induce any director, officer or employee of
Purchaser or its Affiliates to leave the employ of Purchaser or the applicable
Affiliate or (B) in any other way intentionally interfere with the
relationship between Purchaser or its Affiliates and any employee, officer or
director thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section
6.10(b)_, none of Riverstone, any portfolio company of Riverstone (other than
the Bridger Group), any portfolio company of any investment fund affiliated
with Riverstone, or any of their respective directors, officers, equityholders
or employees be deemed an Affiliate of the Bridger Group.

 



 

(c) The covenants and undertakings contained in _Section 6.10_ relate to
matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of _Section 6.10_ would cause irreparable
injury to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, such that money damages or other
legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for such violation. Therefore,
Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, shall be entitled to an injunction,
restraining order or other equitable relief from any court of competent
jurisdiction in the event of any breach of _Section 6.10_ by the other Party
without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond. The
rights and remedies provided by this _Section 6.10_ are cumulative and in
addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have hereunder
or at law or in equity.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
if Seller or Purchaser breaches _Section 6.10(b)_ and the other Party seeks
and obtains an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from
any court of competent jurisdiction, the twelve (12) month period referred to
in such _Section 6.10(b)_ shall be computed from the date relief is granted
to the other Party instead of from the Closing Date and reduced by any time
following the Closing Date during which the breaching Party complied with its
obligations thereunder.

 



 

(e) If any court of competent jurisdiction in a final, binding and
nonappealable judgment determines that a specified time period, geographical
area, business limitation or any other relevant feature of this _Section
6.10_ is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then the maximum
time period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature
which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not
against public policy shall be enforced against the applicable party.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Insurance_. Purchaser covenants and agrees that prior to
Closing, Purchaser will obtain all insurance policies that are required to be
obtained by the Business under applicable Law (the " ** _Insurance Policies_**
") and that all such Insurance Policies will be valid, binding and in full
force and effect.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Affiliate Arrangements_. Except for obligations specified in
_Schedule 6.12(a)_, which will continue after the Closing in accordance with
their terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement, all agreements and
arrangements between and among the Acquired Company and the Acquired
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Bridger Group, on the other hand, are
set forth on _Schedule 6.12(b)_. Except for the contracts set forth on
_Schedule 6.12(c)_, all liabilities and obligations of the Acquired Company
and the Acquired Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Bridger Group, on the
other hand, will automatically terminate in their entirety effective as of the
Closing without any further actions by the Parties and thereby be deemed
voided, cancelled and discharged in their entirety. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, all intercompany accounts among the Acquired
Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Bridger Group,
on the other hand, that then remain outstanding will be terminated, voided,
cancelled and discharged, except to the extent any such accounts would be
taken into account in connection with the determination of Closing Date Net
Working Capital.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Surety Bonds and Letters of Credit_. Purchaser agrees to use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide as soon as practicable following
the date hereof, and shall provide in any event no later the date that is six
months following the Closing Date, replacement security acceptable to the
counterparty or beneficiaries of the guaranties, surety bonds, letters of
credit and other Contracts that are listed in Schedule 4.10(c) and designated
therein with an asterisk (*) (the " ** _Support Obligations_** ") to secure
any and all obligations or liabilities of the Acquired Company, the Acquired
Subsidiaries or the Business thereunder that are not being released in full by
such counterparty or beneficiary on the Closing Date. From and after the
Closing Date and until each of the Sellers and their Affiliates have been
released in full from all of the Support Obligations, Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates from any Losses
arising out of, related to or in connection with the failure of the Purchaser
to replace such Support Obligations.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 6.14 _Debt Financing Matters_. The Seller and its respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members or stockholders shall not have any rights or claims against any of the
commercial banks, investment banks or other financial institutions providing
financing to Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (such financing, the " ** _Debt Financing_** ") and any
arrangers, administrative agents, collateral agents or trustees involved in
such financing, and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, attorneys, advisors, agents and representatives (each a " ** _Debt
Financing Party_** ") in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the performance of any financing commitments of
such Debt Financing Party with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. No Debt
Financing Party shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or
otherwise) to the Seller and its respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders for any
obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the performance of any financing commitments. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any claims or causes of action brought against
any Debt Financing Party in its capacity as such will not be brought in any
forum other than the federal and New York State courts located in the Borough
of Manhattan within the City of New York and shall be governed by the law of
the State of New York and the parties hereto will not support any claim or
cause of action brought against any Debt Financing Party outside of the
federal and New York State courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within
the City of New York. Each party hereto irrevocably waives any and all right
to trial by jury in any legal proceeding involving any Debt Financing Party
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. It is further agreed that the Debt Financing Parties are intended
third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the protections of,
this provision.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Insurance Policy_. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any insurance policy that Purchaser or its Affiliates obtains
relating to this Agreement (e.g. insurance relating to the representations and
warranties contained herein) to contain a waiver of subrogation by the insurer
in favor of Seller (except in instances of fraud).

 



 

Section 6.16 _Assignment of Bridger Group Contracts_. Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to assign, or cause Bridger Marketing to assign, the
contracts set forth on Schedule _6.16_ (the " ** _Bridger Group Contracts_**
") to a member of the Company Group prior to Closing.

 



 

Section 6.17 _Debt Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing, the Acquired
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, use commercially
reasonable to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, which commercially
reasonable efforts shall include:

 



 

(a) furnishing Purchaser as promptly as reasonably practicable with (1)
financial information and other pertinent information regarding the Acquired
Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to
consummate the Debt Financing as is customary to be included in marketing
materials for senior secured notes (or any

 



      
 

 



 

documentation or deliverables in connection therewith) and (2) (A) all
information and data that would be necessary for the Debt Financing Party to
receive customary "comfort" letters from the independent accountants of the
Acquired Company in connection with such an offering, and (B) drafts of such
"comfort" letters (which shall provide customary "negative assurance" comfort)
which such accountants are prepared to issue upon completion of customary
procedures and (C) all other information and data necessary for the Purchaser
to satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraph 4 and subsection (i) of
paragraph 8 of Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment Letter (all such information
described in this clause (a)(2), the " ** _Required Information_** ");

 



 

(b) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road

case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ would not be
satisfied (assuming for purposes of this _Section 9.1(b)_ that the references
in _Section 7.2_ to "Closing Date" mean the date of termination pursuant to

agreements hereunder; _provided further_ , that in the event that all
conditions in _Article 7_ have been satisfied other than _Section 7.1(b)_ as
a result of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act having not

relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority, and
the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any
Tax. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party in connection with any audit or Action

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of

property Taxes, ad valorem Taxes or other Taxes based on the value of

fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire period and (b) in the case of any other Taxes, based on a closing of

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of Taxes that are for the
privilege of doing business in a period that begins after the Closing Date,

the Closing Date even if the Tax is computed based on business activity that
occurred in a prior period and even if the Tax is computed on a combined group
basis. For purposes of the Taxes described in the previous sentence, if the

doing business will be attributable to each entity in the combined group.

(b) with respect to the Cash Purchase Price and amount received pursuant to
the Aggregate Adjustment (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.4_) (the " **

(i) to the extent determined by Seller under Treasury Regulation Section

of the applicable assets, as a reimbursement of preformation capital
expenditures incurred by Seller; and

interest in the assets of the Acquired Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries
in exchange for the Cash Distribution pursuant to Section 707(a) of the Code,
as reduced by the amount allocated as a reimbursement of capital expenditures
under _clause (b)(i)_ above, plus any portion of the assumed liabilities of
the Acquired Company or any Acquired Subsidiary required to be treated as
consideration for the sale of the Acquired Company and/or Acquired
Subsidiaries assets under Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5 (the amount
determined under this _clause (b)(ii)_ is hereinafter referred to as the " **
_Allocation Purchase Price_** ");

the Code and the methodology set forth on _Schedule 11.3_. Not later than 90
days after the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a statement,
allocating the Allocation Purchase Price among the assets of the Company Group
that the Purchaser is deemed to purchase under Section 707 in accordance with
Sections 751 and 1060 of the Code and the methodology set forth in _Schedule
11.3_ (the " ** _Allocation Statement_** ").

 



 

(b) The Seller shall have 30 days to review and notify the Purchaser in
writing of any reasonable, good faith disagreement with the Allocation
Statement. If the Seller does not timely notify the Purchaser of any such
disagreement with the Allocation Statement, the Seller shall be

 



       
 

 



 

conclusively deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Allocation Statement.
If the Seller notifies the Purchaser within 30 days of any such disagreement,
Purchaser and Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to resolve such
dispute within 30 days. In the event that Purchaser and Seller are unable to
resolve such dispute within 30 days, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly retain
a mutually agreeable, nationally recognized accounting firm (that does not
have a material relationship with either Seller or Purchaser, or any of their
respective Affiliates) (the " ** _Tax Allocation Referee_** ") to resolve the
disputed items provided that any resolution shall be in accordance with the
methodology set forth in _Schedule 11.3_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Purchaser and Seller (and the Tax Allocation Referee, if
applicable) shall resolve all disputed items no later than thirty (30) days
after retaining the Tax Allocation Referee. Upon resolution of the disputed
items, the allocation reflected on the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted
to reflect such resolution. The fees and expenses payable to the Tax
Allocation Referee shall be split equally between Purchaser and Seller. Seller
and Purchaser agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation Statement and (ii) act
in accordance with the Allocation Statement in the preparation, filing and
audit of any Tax Return (including filing Form 8594 with a federal income Tax
Return for the taxable year that includes the date of the Closing). Neither
Purchaser nor Seller shall agree to any proposed adjustment to the Allocation
Statement by any Taxing authority without first giving the other Party prior
written notice; _provided, however_ , that nothing contained herein shall
prevent Purchaser or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Taxing authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation
Statement, and neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be required to litigate
before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing authority
challenging such Allocation Statement. Not later than 30 days prior to the
filing of their respective Forms 8594 relating to this transaction, each Party
shall deliver to the other Party a copy of its Form 8594.

 



 

Section 11.4 _Characterization of Certain Payments_. The Parties agree that
any payments made pursuant to _Section 2.4_ shall be treated for all Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales or other transfer Taxes related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by the
Seller and the Purchaser.
