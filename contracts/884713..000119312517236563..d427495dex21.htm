Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions set forth

ARTICLE III CLOSING AND POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS

 

3.1 _Closing and Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Closing Estimates_. No later than three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to Purchaser (A) a certificate signed
by an executive officer of the Seller setting forth the Sellers good faith
calculation of the EBITDA Adjustment and good faith estimates and calculation
of Net Working Capital (" _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), Closing
Indebtedness (" _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), Closing Cash ("
_Estimated Cash_ "), Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Transaction Expenses_
") and the Estimated Consideration (such certificate, the " _Pre-Closing
Statement_ ") for the Traditional Business, consolidated, in each case
determined in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules (if applicable),
together with supporting documentation for such estimates and any additional
information reasonably requested by Purchaser, and (B) final invoices and
other documentation with respect to all Transaction Expenses to be paid by the
Seller, the Group Companies or their respective Affiliates to third parties
at the Closing (the " _Closing Transaction Expenses_ "). The Seller shall
provide Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable and timely access to the
working papers, personnel and other information regarding such calculations
and estimates set forth on the Pre-Closing Statement as Purchaser may
reasonably request, along with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Pre-Closing Statement, and the Seller shall include all comments
reasonably proposed by Purchaser in the Pre-Closing Statement; provided that
if the Parties do not agree within 48 hours on any changes proposed by
Purchaser, the Pre-Closing Statement proposed by Seller shall be the Pre-
Closing Statement. Subject to the foregoing, nothing in this Section 3.1(a)
shall limit, modify, abrogate or otherwise constitute a waiver of any of
Purchasers or the Sellers rights to determine Net Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses (collectively, the " _Final
Amounts_ ") and the Transaction Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c).

 



17 (b) _Adjustment_. At the Closing, the amount of the Estimated Consideration
shall be determined in accordance with Section 2.2.

(c) _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(i) _Purchaser s Calculations_. Within 90 days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared a calculation of the Final
Amounts, in each case determined in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules
(if applicable), and deliver to the Seller such calculations and the
adjustments, if any, required to be made to the Estimated Consideration
pursuant to Sections 3.1(c)(iii), 3.1(c)(iv), 3.1(c)(v) and 3.1(c)(vi).
Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its Representatives reasonable and
timely access to the working papers, personnel and other information
regarding such calculations of the Final Amounts as the Seller may reasonably
request.

(ii) _Determination_. The Seller will have a period of up to 45 days
following the delivery of Purchasers calculations of the Final Amounts and
the Transaction Consideration to notify Purchaser of any disagreements in
reasonable detail with such calculations in writing (such notice being a "
_Seller Objection_ "). If the Seller fails to deliver a Seller Objection
before the end of such 45-day period, Purchasers calculation of the Final
Amounts and the adjustments, if any, required to be made to the
Estimated Consideration pursuant to Sections 3.1(c)(iii), 3.1(c)(iv),
3.1(c)(v) and 3.1(c)(vi) shall become final and binding on the Parties. In the
event the Seller delivers to Purchaser a Seller Objection before the end of
that 45-day period, Purchaser and the Seller shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any disagreements that they may have with respect to any matter
specified in the Seller Objection during the 30-day period following the
delivery to Purchaser of a Seller Objection. If the Parties are unable to
resolve the Seller Objection within such 30-day period, either the Seller, on
the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, shall have the right to submit
the determination of the matters to KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is not available
for such assignment, then an independent accountant of national standing in
the United States reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and the Seller (the "
_Independent Auditor_ "), whose decision shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The Seller and Purchaser shall each submit to the Independent
Auditor, with a copy to the other, a written statement setting forth their
respective positions as to any and all matters that remain in dispute
within 15 days after the appointment of the Independent Auditor. There will
be no ex parte communications between the Seller or Purchaser and the
Independent Auditor, other than written answers by the Seller or Purchaser to
written questions of the Independent Auditor (copies of which shall be
provided simultaneously to such other Party), but each of Purchaser and the
Seller shall have the right to reply in writing to the written submission of
the other within 10 days after its receipt of the others written submission.
The Independent Auditor shall be instructed to resolve all disputed items
within 30 days of the submission to it of such items. In resolving any
disputed item, the Independent Auditor (A) shall be bound by the provisions
of this Section 3.1(c)(ii), (B) may not resolve any disputed matter of law,
(C) may not assign a value to any item greater than the highest value claimed
for such item or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either
Purchaser or the Seller, (D) shall restrict its decision to such items
included in the Seller Objection which are then in dispute,

 



18  (E) may review only the written presentations of the Seller and Purchaser in
resolving any matter which is in dispute, (F) shall render its decision in
writing setting forth in reasonable detail the basis upon which its decision
was made, and (G) shall base that decision on the Balance Sheet Rules and
GAAP. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be paid by
the Party whose aggregate estimate of the disputed amount differs most
greatly from the determination of the Independent Auditor. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the dispute resolution mechanism contained in
this Section 3.1(c)(ii) shall be the exclusive mechanism for resolving
disputes regarding the adjustments relating to the Final Amounts.

(iii) _Net Working Capital Adjustment_. If Net Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii), is less than Estimated Net Working
Capital, then the Estimated Consideration shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar
by the amount of such shortfall. If Net Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii), is greater than Estimated Net
Working Capital, then the Estimated Consideration shall be increased dollar-
for-dollar by the amount of such difference.

 

(iv) _Closing Cash Adjustment_. If Closing Cash, as finally determined
pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii), is less than Estimated Closing Cash, then the
Estimated Consideration shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of
such shortfall. If Closing Cash, as finally determined pursuant to Section
3.1(c)(ii), is greater than Estimated Closing Cash, then the Estimated
Consideration shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such
difference.

(v) _Closing Indebtedness Adjustment_. If Closing Indebtedness, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii), is less than Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, then the Estimated Consideration shall be increased dollar-for-
dollar by the amount of such shortfall. If Closing Indebtedness, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii), is greater than Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, then the Estimated Consideration shall be reduced dollar-for-
dollar by the amount of such difference.

(vi) _Transaction Expenses Adjustment_. If Transaction Expenses, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii), are less than Estimated
Transaction Expenses, then the Estimated Consideration shall be increased
dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such shortfall. If Transaction Expenses, as
finally determined pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii), are greater than Estimated
Transaction Expenses, then the Estimated Consideration shall be reduced
dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such difference.

 

(vii) _Closing Consideration; Payment of Adjustments_. The Estimated
Consideration as adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) shall constitute
the " _Transaction Consideration._ " If it is determined pursuant to this
Section 3.1(c) that the Estimated Consideration paid at the Closing is less
than the Transaction Consideration, subject to Section 3.1(a), Purchaser
shall pay or cause to be paid the absolute value of such difference in cash to
one or more accounts as the Seller shall designate in writing. If it is
determined pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) that the Estimated Transaction
Consideration paid at the Closing is greater than the Transaction
Consideration, the Seller shall pay the absolute value of such difference, to
one or more accounts as Purchaser shall designate in writing.

 



19 (viii) _Timing and Method of Adjustment Payment_. Any cash payment to be made
as a result of adjustments made in accordance with this Section 3.1(c) shall
be paid within five Business Days of the final determination of such
adjustments in accordance with Section 3.1(c)(ii) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts as shall be designated by
Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, at least two Business Days prior
to the date that such payment is to be made.

 

(ix) _Tax Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to the Seller or
any other Person such amounts, if any, as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom or in connection therewith under the Code or any provision
of federal, state, provincial, local or foreign Tax Law or under any
other applicable Law. Purchaser shall provide Seller with written notice
detailing any amounts required to be deducted or withheld from any
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement and shall identify the
applicable Tax Law under which the deduction or withholding is required;
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such notice
at least five Business Days prior to the Closing. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be timely remitted to the
proper Governmental Entity and shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Seller or to the Person, respectively, to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(c) Each Group Company is duly qualified and/or licensed to do business and is
in good standing as a foreign corporation or limited liability company in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the character of the
properties owned or held under lease by it makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
would be materially adverse to the Group Companies taken as a whole.

 



20 (d) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of each Group Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable (to the extent that such concepts are applicable) and

securities). All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
other equity securities of each Group Company are owned by Seller directly or
indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries (including Selling Subsidiaries).
Except as described on Schedule 4.1(d) of the Companies Disclosure Letter,
there are no (and after giving effect to the Intercompany Restructuring, there
will not be any) subscriptions, options, "phantom" stock rights, stock
appreciation rights, warrants or other rights entitling any Person to acquire

other equity securities convertible into or exchangeable for that capital

disposition of any Group Company securities. No Person has any right of first
offer, right of first refusal or preemptive right in connection with any
future offer, sale or issuance of any Group Company securities. No Group
Company has any authorized or outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness the holders of which have the right to vote (or are convertible
into, exchangeable for or evidencing the right to subscribe for or acquire
securities having the right to vote) with the holders of any Group Company
securities on any matter.

(e) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(e) of the Companies Disclosure
Letter, no Group Company is obligated to make any material investment in or
capital contribution to any Person.

 

(f) The Group Companies have provided to Purchaser true and complete copies of
the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other applicable organizational
documents and the stock records of each Group Company, as in effect on the
date hereof. At or prior to Closing, the Group Companies shall provide true
and accurate copies of minute books and corporate records of each Group
Company in the possession of any Group Company. At the Closing, all books of
account, minute books, membership interest record books, stock record books,
and other records of the Group Companies shall be in the possession of the
Group Companies.

 

4.2 _Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) Each Group Company has all requisite power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is or will
become a party, and to perform its obligations under, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and such other Transaction
Documents. The execution and delivery by each Group Company of, and the
performance by it of its obligations under, this Agreement and such other

 



21  Transaction Documents have been (or, to the extent not executed as of the
date hereof, will be) duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
that Group Company. This Agreement has been and such other Transaction
Documents have been (or, when executed and delivered, will be) duly executed
and delivered by each Group Company party thereto. This Agreement and each of
the other Transaction Documents to which a Group Company is a
party constitutes, and each of the other Transaction Documents to which a
Group Company will become a party, when executed and delivered by that Group
Company, will constitute, its valid and binding obligation enforceable by
Purchaser and Purchaser Sub against it in accordance with their respective
terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general principles of
equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions_ ").

 

(b) The execution and delivery by each Group Company of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents to which it is or will become a party do not, and
the performance of its obligations under, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is or will become a party, will not, (i)
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of
its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other applicable organizational
documents, (ii) violate in any material respect any Law applicable to it,

by, the terms of any material Order involving or binding upon it, or any
Material Contract to which any Group Company is a party or by which its
assets are bound, (iv) require any material consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any
Governmental Entity on the part of the Group Companies, other than (x) such

excluding in the case of clause (iii), for Material Contracts which
individually generated gross revenue for the Traditional Business of less than
$10,000,000 in fiscal 2016.

4.3 _Company Financial Statements_.

(a) For purposes of this Section 4.3, references to "Group Companies" shall be
deemed to include the Canadian Business. Complete copies of the unaudited,
consolidated, carve-out financial statements consisting of the balance sheet
of the Group Companies (assuming the consummation of the Intercompany
Restructuring) as of January 2, 2016 and December 31, 2016 and the related
statements of income and cash flow for the fiscal years then ended (the "
_Annual Financial Statements_ "), and unaudited financial statements
consisting of the consolidated, carve-out balance sheet of the Group
Companies as at April 1, 2017 (assuming the consummation of the Intercompany
Restructuring) and the related statement of income for the 3-month period then
ended (the " _Interim Financial Statements_ " and together with the Annual
Financial Statements, the " _Financial Statements_ ") have been delivered to
Purchaser.

 



22  The balance sheet of the Group Companies as of December 31, 2016 is referred
to herein as the " _Balance Sheet_ " and the balance sheet of the Group
Companies as of April 1, 2017 is referred to herein as the " _Interim Balance
Sheet_."

(b) The Financial Statements are derived from the books and records of the
Seller and the Group Companies, and present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position and results of operation of the Group
Companies (assuming the consummation of the Intercompany Restructuring) as of
their historical dates and for the periods indicated. The Financial Statements
(including the accounts receivable, inventory and related reserves reflected
thereon) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and the
assumptions, methodologies and procedures set forth on Schedule 4.3(b) of the
Companies Disclosure Letter applied on a consistent basis for the periods
included, subject to the absence of notes and, in the case of the Interim
Financial Statements, to all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of results of
operations for the interim period and of the financial condition as of the
date of the Interim Balance Sheet but excluding, such other, if any, normal
year-end adjustments (the effect of which would not be material). Neither the
Seller nor the Group Companies has made any material change in their
accounting policies with respect to inventory or accounts receivable within
the past two years.

(c) Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.3(c), as of the date hereof, (i) the
Group Companies have no material liabilities that would be required to be
disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and the
assumptions, methodologies, and procedures set forth on Schedule 4.3(b) of the
Companies Disclosure Letter, that were not reflected or reserved against on
the balance sheet included in the Interim Financial Statements, other than (A)
accounts payable, (B) obligations arising under any Contracts of the Group
Companies (other than obligations arising from a breach thereof by a Group
Company), (C) normal year-end adjustments and accruals, and (D) liabilities
which have been incurred in the ordinary course of business (none of which
arise from any breach of a Contract by a Group Company or any material
violation of any Law or Order by a Group Company or any Action against a Group
Company), and (ii) no Group Company has any known contingent liabilities that
would be required by Accounting Standards Codification 450 (" _ASC 450_ ") to
be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Group Companies
prepared in accordance with GAAP, but for a determination made by management
that such liabilities were not reasonably probable of assertion
or sufficiently determinable in amount to require that they be reflected in
the Financial Statements by ASC 450.

(d) Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.3(d), as of the date hereof, each Group
Company has good title to all material personal property reflected in the
Interim Financial Statements as owned by it and holds a valid lease for all

Employee Plan utilizes a prototype form or volume submitter plan document and
the prototype plans or volume submitter plans sponsor has received a
favorable opinion or advisory letter from the IRS, in each case, regarding its
qualified status under the Code and no event has occurred that caused or
could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification. There
are no material claims (other than routine claims for benefits, and appeals of
such claims) or lawsuits that have been threatened in writing or instituted
against any Employee Plan or any fiduciary (as defined in Section 3(21)(A) of

(a) The Seller and the Group Companies shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide, upon the reasonable request of Purchaser: (i) such financial and
other information regarding the Traditional Business as may be reasonably

contemplated hereby, and (ii) such assistance as Purchaser may reasonably
request in preparing for and participating in due diligence sessions with
potential providers of that financing, including:

sources to evaluate the current assets of the Traditional Business for the
purposes of establishing collateral arrangements as of the Closing and to
assist with other collateral audits and due diligence examinations.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require any
such cooperation to the extent that it would (i) require Seller or any Group
Company to enter into any financing or other agreement that would be effective
prior to the Closing, or (ii) result in any officer, director or manager or
other Representative of the Seller or any Group Company incurring any
personal liability.

(c) Any failure of the Seller or a Group Company to discharge its obligation
under this Section 7.6 shall not constitute a failure of the condition to
closing set forth in Section 10.2(a), unless such failure was in bad faith or
a result of the gross negligence of the Seller or the Group Company, as
applicable, and Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all liabilities suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any such failure that was in bad faith or
a result of the gross negligence of the Seller or the Group Company, as
applicable.

 



56 (d) Nothing in this Section 7.6 shall be construed to create a financing
contingency with respect to Purchasers obligation to consummate the Closing,
it being acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that the Purchaser is obliged
to consummate the Closing even if it is unable to obtain third party
financing, assuming that all Closing conditions are satisfied.

(e) Neither the Seller nor any Group Company shall be required to pay any
commitment or other fees in connection with any Purchaser financing prior to
the Closing, and they shall be reimbursed by Purchaser for any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred or otherwise payable by them in
connection with the cooperation contemplated by this Section 7.6.

(f) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and each Group
Company and their Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities suffered or incurred by them in connection with actions taken in
accordance with this Section 7.6, except (x) to the extent that such
liabilities arise out of or result from any bad faith, negligence or willful
failure to act of the Seller or any Group Company or their Affiliates or
Representatives, or (y) to the extent of amounts paid in settlement of any
such liability if such settlement is effected without the consent of
Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

7.7 _Termination of Affiliate Transactions_. On the Closing Date, unless
otherwise directed by Purchaser, each Group Company and Seller (with respect
to the Canadian Business) shall terminate, or cause to be terminated, in full
all Affiliate Transactions to which it is a party set forth on Schedule 4.18
of the Companies Disclosure Letter or required to be set forth on (but that
are not set forth on) Schedule 4.18 of the Companies Disclosure Letter,
without any liability to Purchaser, the Group Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates following the Closing, provided, however, that the
failure to terminate any Affiliate Transaction that is required to be set
forth on (but is not set forth on) Schedule 4.18 of the Companies
disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to result in a failure to satisfy the
condition to Closing set forth in Section 10.2(a).

7.8  _Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, no Group Company shall (a) except in accordance with the

any public statement regarding any such matter that fails to include a
reaffirmation of the Purchaser board Recommendation, or (iv) make any public

relating to Purchaser, Purchaser Sub, Seller, any Group Company, or any of
their respective Affiliates, this Agreement or the Transactions should be
discovered by Purchaser or Seller which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the materials provided to the stockholders for the Extraordinary
Meeting, so that such materials shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be

for which includes any resolution that may prohibit, preclude, restrain or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

broadly distributed public offering or (ii) fulfilling its contractual
obligations under the Relationship Agreement.

accommodation in connection therewith or initiate or engage in any litigation
against any party.

 



59 8.7 _Financing Commitment Letter_. Purchaser shall not make or permit to be
made any amendment or change to the Senior Facilities Agreement, other than

ARTICLE IX OTHER AGREEMENTS

 

9.1 _Confidentiality_.

(a) Each Party acknowledges that Purchaser and the Seller have previously
executed a confidentiality agreement, dated May 18, 2017 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which agreement shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have the right to
disclose this Agreement, any Disclosure Letter delivered herewith, and the
Ancillary Agreements 

 



60 to the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement. From and after the
Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its or their respective
Representatives (1) to hold in confidence any and all information, whether
written or oral, concerning the Group Companies or the Canadian Business ("
_Group Company Information_ "), except to the extent that Seller can show that
such Group Company Information (a) is or becomes generally available to and
known by the public through no fault of the Seller, any of its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives; or (b) is lawfully developed or acquired by
the Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and
after the Closing from sources which are not prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation, and (2) not to
use such Group Company Information for any purpose whatsoever other than in
compliance with or to enforce its rights under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

(b) If the Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives
are required or requested by deposition, interrogatory, request for
documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand, regulatory request or similar
judicial, regulatory or administrative process to disclose any Group Company
Information, then to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the Seller
shall provide Purchaser with prompt prior written notice of such requirement
so that Purchaser party may seek (at Purchasers expense) a protective order
or similar remedy to cause Group Company Information not to be disclosed. If
such notice is not permissible under applicable Law, or such protective order
is not sought or other similar remedy is not timely obtained or Purchaser
waives compliance with the provisions of this Section 9.1, the Seller shall
furnish only that portion of Group Company Information that its legal counsel
has advised is required or requested, and shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment shall be
accorded such disclosed Group Company Information, to the extent practical
under the circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and any of its
Representatives shall be permitted hereunder to disclose any Group
Company Information to any governmental or regulatory authority, self-
regulatory organization or securities exchange having authority to regulate or
oversee any portion of Sellers business, provided that prior to such
disclosure Seller advises such governmental or regulatory authority, self-
regulatory organization or securities exchange of the confidential nature of
such information and requests confidential treatment of such information.

 

9.2 _Press Releases; No Public Announcement_.

 

(a) In connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
initial announcement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be made by the Parties pursuant to the communication plan set forth on Exhibit
H.

(b) Without limiting Section 9.2(a), prior to the Closing, Purchaser and the
Seller will cooperate with each other regarding the form, content and timing
of any other public disclosure or announcement of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Parties will not, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of their Affiliates and their
respective Representatives not to, issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public disclosure or announcement with respect to this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, their discussions
or any other memoranda, letters or agreements between the Parties relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement 

 



61  without the prior consent of Purchaser and the Seller (such consent not be
unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld); _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained in this Section 9.2(b) shall prohibit (i) the Seller or
Purchaser from announcing or otherwise disclosing the existence of this
Agreement to any employee, consultant, customer, supplier or other Person
having a business relationship with them to the extent reasonably necessary
to conduct their businesses in the ordinary course or (ii) any Party or any
Person related to such Party from making any public filing, disclosure or
announcement or issuing or publishing any press release that is (x) required
by applicable law or regulation, court process or the rules or regulations of
any securities exchange or (y) in response to inquiry by any Governmental
Entity, so long as such Party shall, in each case, use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the other Parties with the opportunity to review
and comment on such disclosure, announcement or press release before it is
made, issued or published. Notwithstanding the foregoing restriction,
Purchaser and Seller may make earnings announcements and participate in
investor conferences in the ordinary course of business in which this
Agreement and the Transactions are discussed.

 

9.3 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Seller shall give prompt notice to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the Seller, of (a) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which has caused any representation or warranty of such Party contained in
this Agreement to be untrue, inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect
at or prior to the Closing, or (b) is reasonably likely to result in any
material, non-curable failure of such Party to satisfy the condition to
Closing set forth in Article X; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall not limit or otherwise affect
any representations and warranties or any conditions, obligations, covenants
or agreements under this Agreement, or the rights or remedies available
hereunder to any of the Party receiving such notice. Should any of the events
for which notice is provided pursuant to this Section 9.3 require a change to
the Companies Disclosure Letter delivered by the Seller, or the
Purchasers Disclosure Letter delivered by Purchaser, as applicable, the
Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, may deliver an amendment to the relevant
Schedule of the Companies Disclosure Letter or Purchaser Disclosure Letter,
as applicable, specifying such change. Any such amendment, and the giving or
receipt by a Party of any notice contemplated by this Section 9.3, shall not
give any Party any right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article XI
that it would not have had in the absence of this Section 9.3.

9.4 _Governmental Approvals; Consents._

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, except as otherwise
provided herein, including Section 9.5 and Schedule 9.5 hereto, the Parties

all consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations with respect thereto,

relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents,
authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental
Entity. The Parties shall cause their respective counsel to reasonably
collaborate with each other to prepare any written materials that will be
jointly submitted to any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to consult with each
other regarding any written submission to any Governmental Entity.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing (and subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Clean Team Agreement dated June 4, 2017 and executed by the
respective counsel of Purchaser and the Seller (the " _Clean Team Agreement_
")), Purchaser or Seller may, as each reasonably deems advisable and
necessary, designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other as "Outside Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient
on the basis that such outside counsel agrees not to disclose such information
to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the source of the materials or its legal
counsel. Materials provided may be redacted (i) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Traditional Business, (ii) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege concerns.

(d) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement, each Party shall promptly notify the other
Party in writing of any pending or, to the Knowledge of such Party, threatened
Action by any Governmental Entity or any other Person (i) challenging or
seeking material damages in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereunder or (ii) seeking to restrain or
prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Subject to the cooperation provisions set forth in Section 9.5, Purchaser
shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any such proceedings or negotiations with the Competition

other Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over the transaction under the
Antitrust Laws.

 

9.5 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Each of the Seller and Purchaser shall (i) make, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, all necessary filings and notifications and other submissions
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby that
are required to be made by each of them under the Antitrust Laws and, in any
event, file the Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act no more

best efforts to obtain termination or expiration of any waiting periods
(including extensions thereof)

 



63  and such other approvals, consents and clearances as may be necessary to
effectuate the Transactions under the Antitrust Laws and to remove any court
or regulatory orders under the Antitrust Laws impeding the ability to
consummate the Transactions. Additionally, in Canada, Purchaser shall submit
to the Commissioner of Competition a request for an advance ruling certificate
(ARC) under section 102 of the Competition Act or in the alternative a no-
action letter and shall do so within three Business Days after the date
hereof. In addition, the Parties shall each submit a notification under
subsection 114(1) of the Competition Act to start the waiting period
prescribed under subsection 123(1) of the Competition Act as soon as

submit a merger notice to the CMA (as provided for by section 96 the
Enterprise Act 2002, as amended by the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act

necessary to ensure that the CMA gives notice under section 96(2A) EA02 to the
Purchaser that the merger notice meets the requirements of section 96(2) EA02.
The Parties shall not, without the prior consent of the CMA, take any "pre-
emptive" action contrary to any interim order in force under section 72 EA02
prior to or after the Closing, until the CMA has issued a final decision with
respect to its merger control review of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the EA02.

(c) The Parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in
good faith the views of one another (in accordance with the procedures and
terms set forth on Schedule 9.5), in connection with any notices, submissions,
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Laws. Each of Purchaser
and the Seller shall specifically request early termination of any waiting
period and, if permitted to do so under applicable Antitrust Laws, use
reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods under Antitrust
Laws and to obtain all requisite decisions, approvals, clearances and
authorizations required under the Antitrust Laws to complete the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as possible.

 

(d) The Parties shall give one another reasonable notice of and opportunity
for their representatives or any of their advisors to attend all material

meeting or part(s) of the meeting) and provide one another with drafts of
material written communications, other than commercially sensitive portions
thereof, intended to be sent to any Governmental Entity with jurisdiction
under the Antitrust Laws and a reasonable opportunity to comment on those
materials, and final copies of all such communications.

(e) If the parties receive a request for information or documentary material
pursuant to any Antitrust Law, including the EA02 and the HSR Act (any such
request pursuant to the HSR Act, a " _Second Request_ "), the parties will use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to submit an appropriate
response to, and to certify compliance as soon as

 



64  reasonably practicable with, any such request for information or documentary
material, and, in any event, to certify compliance with any Second Request
within four (4) months after receipt of such request and use commercially
reasonable best efforts to produce documents on a rolling basis.

(f) Each Party shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity under any
applicable Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser or the Seller, threatened to be instituted) challenging
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust
Law, each of Purchaser and the Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to contest and resist any such Action and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed, or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. With respect to the CMA, the
Parties shall use their respective best efforts (in accordance with the terms
and procedures set forth on Schedule 9.5) to prevent the CMAs issuance of a
final decision to refer the Transactions for a second phase investigation as
set forth below.

(g) To permit the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 10.1(a)
as promptly as practicable and to procure a CMA Clearance Decision as promptly
as practicable, the Purchaser shall, so long as such actions or inactions do
not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Burdensome Condition, (i)
subject only to the last sentence of Section 9.5(h), propose, negotiate,
commit to, effect and agree to, by consent decree (or by written undertakings
satisfactory in form to the relevant authorities (including, in the case of
the CMA, undertakings or final undertakings in lieu of a reference under
section 73 EA02 and final undertakings under section 82 EA02 in accordance
with the procedures set forth on Schedule 9.5) including, in each
case, undertakings to effect sales, divestitures, licenses, hold separate, or
other dispositions (any such event, a " _Divestiture_ ") of businesses,
assets, properties, and/or product lines that contributed up to $150 million
to the pro forma combined 2016 revenue of the Purchaser and its Affiliates
and the Group Companies (after giving effect to the Intercompany
Restructuring) (" _Subject Revenue_ ")), hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, and other disposition of and
restrictions on the businesses, assets, properties and/or product lines, or
changes to the conduct of business of, the Purchaser and the Group Companies,
and take such action or actions at or following the Closing that would in the
aggregate have a similar effect, (ii) create, terminate, or divest
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Purchaser or
the Group Companies and their respective Subsidiaries at or following the
Closing, and (iii) otherwise take or commit to take any action that would
limit Purchasers freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain
or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, properties or
product lines of the Purchaser or the Group Companies. If it becomes necessary
to achieve a final CMA Clearance Decision, Purchaser must offer, agree to and
effectuate any Divesture proposed by the CMA that is not a
Burdensome Condition.

(h) If any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction under any Antitrust Law
requires that the Purchaser to take, or cause to be taken, or commit to take,
or commit to cause to be taken, or if Purchaser offers any undertakings in
lieu of a reference to the CMA under section 73 EA02 or final undertakings
under section 82 EA02 which are accepted by the relevant 

 



65  Governmental Entity and that commit to, any Divestiture, of or with respect
to businesses, assets, properties and/or product lines of the Purchaser and
the Group Companies, then, subject only to the last sentence of this Section
9.5(h) and Schedule 9.5, the Purchaser shall cause such Divestiture to occur,
unless it is a Burdensome Condition. As used herein, a " _Burdensome
Condition_ " shall mean a Divestiture of businesses, assets, properties
and/or product lines that contributed in excess of $150 million to Subject
Revenue, and/or any other action (including, without limitation, the types of
activities described in Section 9.5(g)(ii) or Section 9.5(g)(iii)), that
individually or in the aggregate would result in a reduction of in excess of
$150 million to Subject Revenue. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement, Seller shall not be required in any event (i) to divest any assets
or take any action that would affect its operations after the Closing or (ii)
to take any action that would require it or any Group Company to effect a
Divestiture prior to Closing.

 

(i) Neither Party shall make or agree to make (or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to make or agree to make) any acquisition
or investment or enter into any transaction or undertake any action which is
reasonably likely to delay, impede, or prejudice the promptest possible
fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Section 10.1(a).

 

9.6 _Intercompany Restructuring_. The Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries, and
the Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including
any Group Companies and Purchaser Sub) and their respective Representatives to
effectuate the Intercompany Restructuring and the Corporate Reorganization

Group Companies and/or the Affiliate of Purchaser acquiring the Canadian
Business shall (as provided in this Agreement and the Reorganization
Agreement) (i) acquire all right, title, and interest of the Seller or any of
its Affiliates in and to all of the assets of the Traditional Business
reflected in the Financial Statements or thereafter acquired through the
Closing and (ii) assume all Liabilities of the Traditional Business reflected
in the Financial Statements or thereafter incurred through the Closing
(except to the extent they are entitled to indemnification for such
Liabilities pursuant to Article XII or Article XIII), and (b) the Seller or
another Retained Company designated by the Seller shall acquire all of the
assets and assume all of the Liabilities of the Retained Business, in each
case subject to and in accordance with the Reorganization Agreement; for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 9.6 shall be construed to relieve
any party of its obligations under any other provision of this Agreement or of
its rights to indemnification hereunder.

 

9.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Seller and the Group
Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary
action in order to comply with all applicable notification, consultation, and
consent requirements with respect to all unions, works councils, employee
associations or committees and similar bodies in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Purchaser agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Seller and the Group
Companies in respect of the foregoing.

 



66 (b) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each active employee of the Traditional Business hired and
retained by it such compensation and employee benefits as Purchaser in its
discretion shall determine, subject to applicable Laws. Purchaser acknowledges

insurance policy providing coverage for a period of six years following the
Closing for acts and omissions of the individuals who were officers or
directors of any Group Company prior to the Closing (" _D andO Insurance_")
with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary in this Agreement or in the DandO Insurance, (a)
no provision hereof or indemnification right in the DandO Insurance shall limit
in any way the right of any Purchaser Indemnified Party to indemnification
pursuant to Article XII or Article XIII and (b) in no event shall Purchaser,
the Group Companies or any of their respective successors and assigns have
any obligation or liability of any kind whatsoever under this Section 9.8 to
any Person with respect to indemnification, holding harmless, exculpation or
expenses arising out of matters for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
are indemnified pursuant to Article XII or Article XIII.

9.9 _Books and Records_. For a period of seven years after the Closing, the
Group Companies shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Group Companies to,
provide to the Seller reasonable access to the Representatives, books and
records of the Group Companies upon reasonable advance written notice during
regular business hours and without undue interruption to their businesses, for
the purpose of obtaining information reasonably required in connection with
the preparation of Tax Returns or the defense of any claim by a third party
or any other reasonable purpose, and will permit the Seller to make copies of
any such information (at the Sellers sole cost and expense). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any Group Company shall have
any obligation to provide Seller with any information or documents the
disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under applicable Law or is
legally privileged; provided, that they shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate to permit such disclosure in a manner that is permitted
under applicable Law or that is consistent with the preservation of such
privilege, as applicable.

after any termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article XI, neither
Seller nor Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates shall: (i) in any

beneficial ownership thereof); (ii) except at the specific written request of
the other, propose to enter into, directly or indirectly, any merger or
business combination involving the other or any of its Subsidiaries or
divisions; (iii) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek
to control or influence the management, board of directors, or policies of
the other; (iv) disclose any intention, plan, or arrangement inconsistent with
the foregoing; or (v) advise, assist, or encourage any other Persons in
connection with any of the foregoing. During this period, neither Seller nor
Purchaser nor their respective Affiliates shall request that the other,
directly or indirectly, amend or waive any provision of this Section 9.10 or
tender for any shares of the others capital stock; provided that, this
paragraph shall terminate as to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, upon the
public announcement by the other that it has entered into a definitive
agreement providing for a sale of all or substantially all of its capital
stock or assets to a third party whether by way of purchase, exchange, merger,
amalgamation, combination or any similar transaction.

 



67 9.11 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, each Party agrees to
cooperate fully with any other Party and to execute such further instruments,
documents and agreements and to give such further written assurances, as may
be reasonably requested by such other Party to better evidence and reflect the

, _however_ , that for purposes of this Section 9.12(a)(i), ownership of

will not be limited to (x) restraining Seller or its Affiliates from engaging
in any action that would constitute or cause a breach or violation of this
Section 9.12, and (y) obtaining specific performance to compel Seller or its

of its Affiliates from pursuing any other remedy available to it for such
breach or threatened breach.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that no portion of the Transaction
Consideration shall be allocable to the covenants in this Section 9.12.

standard premium) the title policies in the form attached to Schedule 9.14 to
the Companies Disclosure Letter or such other form as is reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser. For the sake of clarity, the failure of Purchaser to
obtain any such title policy shall not constitute a failure of a condition to
Closing.

Agreement or by any Group Company of any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement or the Reorganization Agreement that requires
performance after the Closing; and

 

(v) any Action brought by any equity holder, or other former holder, or
alleged holder of any equity interests of Purchaser (including
any predecessors) in their capacities as such, including any alleged breach
of fiduciary duty, arising out of, resulting from or in connection this
Agreement, or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any
Ancillary Agreements.

 

 _provided_ , in each case, that the relevant Seller Indemnified Party has
submitted to Purchaser a Notice of Claim or Third-Party Notice, as
applicable, for Damages in respect thereof in accordance with Section 12.4
prior to the date of the expiration of the applicable survival period
specified in Section 12.2(a), in which case any claim that is the subject of
such Notice of Claim or Third-Party Notice, as applicable, shall survive
until finally resolved or judicially determined.

(c) For purposes of Sections 12.1 and 13.1, the representations and
warranties set forth in Article IV, Article V, and Article VI shall be deemed
to have been made as of the date hereof and as of the Closing as if made at
and as of the Closing (unless such representation or warranty is expressly
limited by its terms to the date hereof or another specified date, in which
case at and as of such earlier specified date).

 



75 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, all indemnification matters relating to Taxes
in this Agreement, including breaches of Tax representations, Tax warranties,
Tax covenants and the indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
therefor (other than with respect to certain of the limitations set forth in
Section 12.2), are dealt with exclusively in Article XIII.

(e) For purposes of calculating the amount of any Damages resulting from an
inaccuracy in, misrepresentation of, or breach of, any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement (other than Section 4.3), the terms
"material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" or
similar qualifications contained in such representations and warranties (but
not in Section 12.1(a)(viii)) shall be disregarded; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such terms shall be given full effect in determining whether such
inaccuracy, misrepresentation, or breach has occurred.

(f) If any Indemnifying Party fails to pay an Indemnified Party any due amount
owed to such Indemnified Party under Article XII or Article XIII, and within
five (5) business days of notice from such Indemnified Party that such payment
is due, the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse such Indemnified Party for
all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred by them (including
reasonable expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of Article XII or Article XIII (as applicable). If any amount
payable to any Indemnified Party under Article XII or Article XIII is not
paid when due, any unpaid amount shall bear interest at the rate of 5% per
annum, compounded monthly, until paid in full.

 

12.2 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) All representations and warranties of the Seller, the Group Companies, the
Purchaser, and Purchaser Sub under this Agreement will survive the Closing
until, and will expire at, 5:00 p.m. New York time on the eighteen-month
anniversary of the Closing Date, except for (i) the representations and
warranties relating to Taxes made in Section 4.4, which shall survive
the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including any extensions, tolling or waivers thereof), plus 60 days, and (ii)
the Group Company Fundamental Representations, Seller Fundamental
Representations and Purchaser Fundamental Representations, which shall
survive the Closing indefinitely. All covenants under this Agreement requiring
performance prior to or at the Closing shall expire immediately after the
Closing, except for covenants, if any, required to be performed after the
Closing, which shall expire on the completion of their performance. The other
obligations of the Seller to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees set forth in
Section 12.1(a) shall survive for the following periods, within which claims
for indemnification may be made: (A) the matters set forth in Section
12.1(a)(viii) for a period of 18 months following the Closing (except for
material breaches or material inaccuracy in respect of Section 4.4, which
shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including any extensions, tolling or waivers thereof), plus 60 days); and (B)
the matters set forth on Schedule 12.1(a)(ix) for the applicable period
listed on Schedule 12.1(a)(ix) for each such matter.

(b) Neither the Purchaser Indemnified Parties nor the Seller Indemnified
Parties (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall be entitled to seek
indemnification under Section 12.1(a)(i), Section 12.1(a)(ii), Section
12.1(b)(i), or Section 12.1(a)(viii) as applicable, until the aggregate
amount of all Damages suffered by all Purchaser Indemnified Parties or all
Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, exceeds in the aggregate an
amount equal to $4,500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), and then such
Indemnified Party shall only be entitled to indemnification for the aggregate
amount of Damages that exceeds the Basket Amount.

 



76 (c) Neither the Purchaser Indemnified Parties nor the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall be deemed to have incurred any Damages under Section
12.1(a)(i), Section 12.1(a)(ii), Section 12.1(a)(viii) or Section 12.1(b)(i)
as applicable, unless the claim (or series of related claims, claims having a
common or substantially similar cause or claims that arise out of reasonably
common circumstances) for Damages exceeds $100,000 (the " _De Minimis Amount_
").

 

(d) The aggregate amount of all payments to which the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to receive under Section 12.1(a)(i) or Section
12.1(a)(ii), as applicable, shall in no event exceed the Escrow Amount. The
aggregate amount of all payments to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to receive under Section 12.1(a)(viii) and Section
12.1(a)(ix) shall in no event exceed $12,500,000. For the avoidance of doubt,
the limitations set forth in this Section 12.2(d) shall not preclude or limit
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties right to recover under any insurance
policy, including the RandW Policy.

(e) The aggregate amount of all payments to which the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to receive under Section 12.1(a)(iii) through
Section 12.1(a)(vii), or Section 13.1(a), as applicable, shall in no event
exceed the Transaction Consideration, which for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not preclude or limit the Purchaser Indemnified Parties right to recover
under any insurance policy, including the RandW Policy.

 

(f) The aggregate amount of all payments to which the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to receive under Section 12.1(b) shall in no event
exceed the Transaction Consideration.

(g) None of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek
indemnification for Damages under this Article XII or Article XIII to the
extent that the amount of Damages had been fully accounted for in any
adjustments pursuant to Section 3.1, including in any component of
Indebtedness, Net Working Capital or Transaction Expenses.

(h) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds (other than under the
RandW Policy): (i) actually received by the Indemnified Party after giving
effect to any applicable deductible or retention; (ii) within three years of
the date such Damages were suffered by the Indemnified Party; and (iii) under
applicable insurance policies (net of any expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in procuring such recovery, including any retrospective or
prospective increased premiums or costs) reimbursing such Indemnified Party
for such Damages. The Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to pursue any reasonably available insurance recoveries.

 

(i) In no event shall Seller be liable (A) for any Damages that are not
reasonably foreseeable as of the date hereof, (B) for any punitive or
exemplary Damages, except to the extent awarded by a court of competent
jurisdiction to a third party in connection with a third party claim, or (C)
in the case of a claim by a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
12.1(a)(iv), Section 12.1(a)(vii), or Section 12.1(a)(ix), for Damages
calculated as a multiple of earnings derivative or similar amount that may
have been used by Purchaser to calculate the Purchase Price.

 



77 (j) Neither the Seller Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, or the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, may recover Damages more than once
for any underlying claim.

(k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the limitations set
forth in this Section 12.2 shall not apply in the event that Seller is found
to have committed actual fraud with regard to a specific claim.

 

12.3 _Exclusive Remedies_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement or otherwise, following the Closing, except with respect to
claims based on actual fraud or a dispute under Section 3.1 (which shall be
governed exclusively by Section 3.1) or as set forth in Section 12.3(b), the
indemnification provisions of this Article XII and Article XIII are the sole
and exclusive remedies of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement and the
Reorganization Agreement. From and after the Closing, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, except with respect to claims based on actual fraud, a
dispute under Section 3.1 (which shall be governed exclusively by Section
3.1), as set forth in Section 12.3(b) or the indemnification provisions of
this Article XII and Article XIII, the Parties hereby waive all other rights,
claims, remedies or actions with respect to any matter arising under this
Agreement or the Reorganization Agreement, whether under any applicable Law or
otherwise. Except as provided in this Article XII and Article XIII or for
actual fraud, from and after the Closing, no right, claim, remedy or action
shall be brought or maintained by any Party, and no recourse shall be brought
or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misstatement or omission respecting an inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations or warranties of any of the Parties set forth or contained in
this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 12.3(b)
shall not preclude any Party from bringing an action for specific performance
after the Closing to require the other Party to perform any covenant or other
agreement under this Agreement, or the Reorganization Agreement to be
performed after the Closing.

 

12.4 _Terms and Conditions of Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts_.

 

(a) If any Indemnified Party shall claim indemnification under this Article
XII for any claim (other than a third-party claim) for which indemnification
is provided in Section 12.1, such Indemnified Party shall promptly, and in any
event within 30 days after obtaining facts that are sufficient for such
Indemnified Party to determine whether a claim for indemnification may be
properly made under this Article XII, give written notice (a " _Notice of
Claim_ ") to the Seller or Purchaser, as applicable (each, an " _Indemnifying
Party_ "), setting forth (i) the aggregate amount of the Damages or an
estimate thereof, in each case to the extent known or determinable at such
time, (ii) reasonable detail of the individual items of such Damages included
in the amount so stated, (iii) the date each such item was paid or accrued or
arose and

 



78  (iv) the nature of the misrepresentation, breach or claim to which such item
is related; provided, however, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to
provide a Notice of Claim within the 30 day period described above shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent that such failure shall prejudice any defense or claim available to the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after delivery
of the Notice of Claim to notify the Indemnified Party in writing of the
nature and basis of its objection, if any, to the asserted claim for
indemnification; provided, however, that the failure of the Indemnifying Party
to provide its objection within the 30 day period described above shall not
be a concession of liability hereunder, except to the extent that such failure
shall prejudice the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party disputes any
claim set forth in the Notice of Claim, it may, within the period of 30 days
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, deliver to the Indemnified
Party that has given the Notice of Claim a written notice indicating its
dispute of such Notice of Claim, along with reasonable supporting information
as to the nature and basis of the objection (an " _Objection Notice_ ").If no
such Objection Notice is received by the Indemnified Party within 30 days
after delivery of the Notice of Claim, the claim shall be deemed to be
allowed.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party shall deliver an Objection Notice with respect
to any claim or claims by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall
have 30 days from the receipt of such Objection Notice to respond in a written
statement to the objection. If after such 30 day period there remains a
dispute as to any claims, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall attempt in good faith for 30 days to agree upon their rights with
respect to each of such claims, after which such Persons may pursue all other
remedies available to them at law or equity in accordance with this
Agreement.

(c) If an Indemnified Party shall claim indemnification hereunder arising from
any claim or demand of a third party for which indemnification is provided in
Section 12.1, the Indemnified Party shall promptly, and in any event within 30
days after such claim or demand is received in writing by such Indemnified
Party, give written notice (a " _Third-Party Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying
Party of the basis for such claim, setting forth the nature of the claim or
demand in reasonable detail (to the extent then known); _provided_ , _however_
, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide a Third-Party Notice
within the 30 day period described above shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure
shall prejudice any defense or claim available to the Indemnifying Party. The
respective obligations and liabilities of the Parties to indemnify pursuant to
this Article XII in respect of any Damages arising from a claim by a third
party shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions:

(i) Subject to the various rights of the insurance carrier(s) under the
express terms of the RandW Policy, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to undertake, by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, the defense of such claim;
_provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to undertake
the defense of such third party claim if (A) such claim seeks injunctive
relief or is part of a criminal Action, (B) such claim has or could reasonably
be expected, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, to result
in Damages to the Indemnified Party such that, after giving effect to the
limitations set forth in Section 12.2, in each case as applicable, and the
other limitations set forth in this Article XII, the Indemnifying Party would
reasonably be expected to bear less than 50% of the Damages with respect to
such claim, or (C) the Indemnifying Party has

 



79  failed or is failing to defend in good faith such claim. In all events the
insurers under the RandW Policy and their agents and advisors shall be permitted
to associate effectively with any Party to this Agreement in the defense of
any matter which might reasonably constitute a loss that is covered by the RandW
Policy.

(ii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party is permitted, but shall elect
not to, undertake such defense, the Indemnified Party (upon further written
notice to the Indemnifying Party) shall have the right to undertake the
defense, compromise or settlement of such claim, by counsel or other
representatives of its own choosing, on behalf of and for the account and risk
of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party
shall not compromise or settle any such claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld).

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.4(c) to the contrary, (A) if
there is a reasonable probability that a claim may materially and adversely
affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result of money damages or other
money payments, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost
and expense, to participate in the defense, compromise or settlement of the
claim, (B) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified Partys
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld), settle or compromise any claim or consent to
entry of any judgment, unless (1) the settlement or compromise does not
entail any admission of liability on the part of any Indemnified Party and (2)
the claiming party or the plaintiff in such claim gives to the Indemnified
Party an unconditional release from all liability in respect of such claim
and (C) in the event that the Indemnifying Party undertakes defense of any
claim, the Indemnified Party by counsel or other Representative of its own
choosing and at its sole cost and expense shall have the right to consult
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel or other Representatives
concerning such claim and participate in the defense thereof, and the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and their respective counsel or
other Representatives shall cooperate with respect to such claim, subject to
the execution and delivery of a mutually satisfactory joint defense agreement.

 

(d) A claim for indemnification under this Article XII shall be deemed finally
determined upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) it is deemed
allowed under Section 12.4(a); (ii) entry of any final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction; (iii) full execution of a
settlement of a third party claim executed by both the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party; or (iv) the execution by the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party of a mutually binding settlement agreement with respect to a
claim.

 

(e) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties right to indemnification pursuant to
Sections 12.1(a) or 13.1(a) on account of any Damages will be: first, during
the period for which the Escrow Agreement remains in effect, such Damages will
be satisfied from the Escrow Amount (to the extent available) pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement; then second, such Damages will be satisfied from the RandW
Policy (to the extent available and such Damages relates to a breach of a
representation or warranty contained herein).

 

(f) In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Section 12.4
and the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
govern.

 



80 12.5 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. All indemnification payments pursuant
to this Article XII or Article XIII shall be treated as adjustments to the
Transaction Consideration for all Tax purposes, and such agreed treatment
shall govern for purposes of this Agreement and no Party shall take a position
inconsistent therewith on a Tax Return or otherwise, except as otherwise
required by a change in applicable Law or a final determination.

ARTICLE XIII TAX MATTERS

13.1 _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing and subject to the applicable limitations
contained in Section 12.2 and this Article XIII, the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be indemnified and held harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, from, against and in respect of any Damages to
the extent actually incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and
arising out of or as a result of any of the following:

(i) Taxes of the Group Companies for periods or portions thereof ending on or
before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Taxes_ ") or imposed on any Group
Company pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar or
corresponding federal, state, provincial, local or foreign Law with respect to
the full taxable period that includes the Closing Date, by reason of such
Group Company being, or ceasing to be, a member of any consolidated group
including Seller or included in a consolidated or combined return of Seller;

 

(ii) Taxes imposed on a Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of any breach
of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty set forth in Section
4.4; or

(iii) any breach of or failure to perform a covenant or agreement of the
Company set forth in Section 7.8.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to indemnify for Taxes pursuant
to Section 13.1(a) shall not require a duplicate payment of Tax amounts that
have already been taken into account as current liabilities in the
determination of Net Working Capital. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes of determining Damages actually
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article XIII,
(i) the loss of any Tax asset or Tax attribute (or for the avoidance of doubt,
any increased Tax liability incurred by Purchaser as a result of the loss of
such Tax assets or Tax attributes), (ii) Taxes (other than Taxes attributable
to a breach of any representation and warranty in Section 4.14(o)) to the
extent such Taxes are attributable to a Tax period (or portion thereof)
beginning on or after the Closing Date, and (iii) Taxes that result from
transactions or actions taken by Purchaser, Purchaser Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates (including for the avoidance of doubt, the
Group Companies) after the Closing that are not contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case, shall not be treated as Damages.

13.2 _Tax Audits and Contests; Cooperation_.

(a) After the Closing, Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in writing
of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement of an audit received by
Purchaser, the Group Companies or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing from
any Governmental Entity or any other

 



81  Person with respect to Taxes for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party may be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 13.1; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that a failure to give such notice will not affect the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties rights to indemnification under this Article XIII, except to the
extent that any Seller Indemnified Parties are actually prejudiced thereby.
Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known)
describing the asserted Tax liability and shall include copies of the relevant
portion of any notice or other document received from any Governmental Entity
or any other Person in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.

(b) After the Closing Date, except as provided in Section13.2(c) below,
Purchaser shall control, through counsel of its own choosing, the conduct of
any audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding
involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to any Group
Company (any such audit, claim for refund, or proceeding relating to an
asserted Tax liability is referred to herein as a " _Contest_ ").

(c) In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates to a
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Return filed by a parent entity
that is not a Group Company, such parent entity shall control the conduct of
such Contest. In the case of any other Contest after the Closing Date: if
such Contest relates solely or predominantly to Taxes for which a Purchaser
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under Section 13.1(a),
the Seller shall control the conduct of such Contest, but the Purchaser shall
have the right to participate in such Contest at its own expense, and Seller
shall not be able to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such
Contest that adversely affects the Tax liability of any Group Company for
any taxable year (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and if such other Contest
relates, in part, to Taxes for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party may be
entitled to indemnification under Section 13.1(a), the Purchaser shall control
the conduct of such Contest, but the Seller shall have the right to
participate in such Contest at its own expense, and Purchaser shall not be
able to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that
adversely affects the Tax liability or indemnification obligation of Seller
without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(d) The Seller and Purchaser agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including
access to books and records) and assistance relating to the Group Companies as
is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns and the preparation,
prosecution, defense or conduct of any Contest. The Seller and Purchaser
shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Contest or
other proceeding involving or otherwise relating to the Group Companies (or
the income or assets of the Group Companies) with respect to any Tax and each
shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 13.2(d). Any information
obtained under this Section 13.2(d) shall be kept confidential, except as may
be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the
conduct of a Contest or other Tax proceeding.

 



82 13.3 _Preparation of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely file (or cause
to be timely filed) all income Tax Returns of, or with respect to, the Group
Companies with respect to any taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date (" _Pre-Closing Taxable Periods_ ") that are required to be filed with
any Governmental Entity after the Closing Date, provided, that Seller shall
deliver any such income Tax Return (other than any consolidated, combined,
unitary or similar Tax Return filed by a parent entity that is not a Group
Company) to the Purchaser for its review at least 20 Business Days prior to
the date such income Tax Return is required to be filed (including
extensions) and Seller shall consider in good faith such revisions to such Tax
Returns, as are reasonably requested by Purchaser. Subject to Section 13.1(b),
Seller shall timely pay to Purchaser all Pre-Closing Taxes shown on any Tax
Return filed pursuant to this Section 13.3(a), except to the extent such Taxes
are taken into account in the calculation of Net Working Capital.

 

(b) In the case of other Tax Returns of the Group Companies with respect to
any Pre-Closing Taxable Periods that are required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity after the Closing Date and Tax Returns that are filed with
respect to Straddle Periods, Purchaser shall, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, prepare such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past
practice, and timely file such Tax Returns with the applicable Governmental
Entity, provided, that Purchaser shall deliver any such Tax Return to the
Seller for its review at least 20 Business Days prior to the date such Tax
Return is required to be filed (including extensions) and Purchaser shall
make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the
Seller. Subject to Section 13.1(b), Seller shall timely pay to Purchaser all
Pre-Closing Taxes shown on any Tax Return filed pursuant to this Section
13.3(b), except to the extent such Taxes are taken into account in the
calculation of Net Working Capital.

 

13.4 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Taxes of the Group Companies that are payable with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of any such Taxes that constitutes Pre-Closing Taxes
shall: (a) in the case of Taxes that are either (i) based upon or related to
income, receipts, profits, wages, capital or net worth, (ii) imposed
in connection with any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale,
transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible),
or (iii) required to be withheld, be deemed equal to the amount that would be
payable if the Tax year or period ended on the Closing Date; and (b) in the
case of Taxes (other than those described in clause (a) above) that are
imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of the
Group Companies or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of
such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (a) of
the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item
(including the effect of any graduated rates of Tax) that is calculated on an
annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the total
amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period times a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a
manner consistent with past practice of the Group Companies.

 



83 13.5 _Refunds_. If a Group Company receives a refund, credit or other
reduction of Taxes attributable to any taxable period (or portion of a
taxable period) ending on or before the Closing Date (except to the extent
such reduction results from the carryback of any Tax loss from any Post-
Closing Tax Period (as defined below)), the Purchaser shall promptly pay, or
cause to be promptly paid, such amount to the Seller including interest, if
such reimbursement is made with interest, in each case net of Purchasers
reasonable third-party expenses and any Taxes imposed on Purchaser as a
result of its receipt of such refund. In addition, the Purchaser shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Seller an amount equal to any refund of Taxes (i)
that would have been payable to the Seller pursuant to this Section 13.5,
except that such refund was used to pay any Tax liability for any taxable
period beginning on or after the Closing Date (" _Post-Closing Tax Period_ ")
or (ii) would have been payable to the Seller pursuant to this Section 13.5
if it were possible to file Tax Returns for each Straddle Period as if the
taxable year ended on the Closing Date.

 

13.6 _Amended Tax Returns_. On or after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
not (and shall not cause any of its Affiliates, including for the avoidance
of doubt, the Group Companies to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax
Returns of the Group Companies for any Pre-Closing Taxable Periods or Straddle
Periods (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Return Amendment_ "), without the prior written
consent of the Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

13.7 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, gross receipts, transfer, intangible,
recordation, land transfer, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges of
any nature whatsoever (including any penalties and interest) (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ "), applicable to, or resulting from, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall be paid 50% by the Seller and 50% by the
Purchaser. The Purchaser shall file, at its sole expense, all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and
the Seller shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary.

13.8  _Section 338(h)(10) Election; Allocation of Purchase Price_.

(a) The parent of the consolidated group of which the U.S. corporation being
sold is a member will join with the purchasing corporation in making an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding
state/local elections) with respect to the stock of the U.S. corporation sold.

 

(b) Within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, the assets of the U.S.
corporation with respect to which the Section 338(h)(10) election is being
made and the assets of the Canadian Business, shall be appraised by a
regionally or nationally recognized appraisal firm engaged by Purchaser. Such
appraisal shall be based on the fair market value of such assets, determined
in accordance with GAAP and Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-6. Such
appraisal firm shall also allocate the adjusted grossed-up basis for such
corporation (to the extent properly taken into account for U.S. income Tax
purposes) among the assets of such corporation and shall allocate the
Purchase Price for the assets of the Canadian Business (including assumed
liabilities)

 



84  among such assets, in each case consistent with such appraisal. Purchaser
shall provide such allocation to Seller and, for a period of forty-five (45)
days after receipt thereof, Seller shall have the opportunity to review and
comment on such allocation. Purchaser shall consider in good faith any such
comments provided by Seller, and Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve any disputes with respect to such allocation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute
with respect to the such allocation within fifteen (15) days after the
delivery of such allocation to Seller, Seller and Purchaser shall identify in
writing the items in dispute and shall immediately engage the Independent
Auditor to resolve such disputed items, which resolution shall be set forth in
a written report delivered to the parties and shall be conclusive and binding
on the parties hereto and shall be enforceable in a court of law. Such
allocation as finally agreed upon by the parties or determined by the
Independent Auditor shall be conclusive and binding upon the Seller and
Purchaser for all purposes, and the Parties agree that all Tax Returns
(including IRS Form 8594) and financial statements shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with (and the Parties shall not otherwise take a position on
a Tax Return that is inconsistent with) such allocation, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. Upon any payment treated as an adjustment to the
Transaction Consideration under this Agreement, Purchaser shall provide Seller
with an amendment to such allocation reflecting such adjustment, which shall
be subject to the review and comment of Seller in accordance with the
principles set forth in the preceding sentence.

13.9 _Additional Tax Provisions_.

(a) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser against any
Pre-Closing Tax incurred by Purchaser (or the Affiliate of Purchaser
acquiring the Canadian Business) as a result of or in connection with any non-
compliance by Seller with the provisions of the Retail Sales Tax Act
(Ontario), the Provincial Sales Tax Act (British Columbia) or under any
other similar Law of a province or territory of Canada.

(b) Purchaser (or the Affiliate of Purchaser acquiring the Canadian Business)
and Seller shall jointly elect under subsection 167(1) of the HST Act and
section 75 of the QST Act so that no HST or QST will be payable in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser (or the Affiliate
of Purchaser acquiring the Canadian Business) and the Seller shall jointly
complete the election forms (more particularly described as form GST-44 and
QST form FP-2044-V) in respect of such elections and Purchaser (or the
Affiliate of Purchaser acquiring the Canadian Business) shall file the said
election forms no later than the due date for the HST and QST returns of the
Affiliate of Purchaser acquiring the Canadian Business for the first reporting
period in which HST or QST, as applicable, would, in the absence of such
elections, become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller on
an after-tax basis from and against any Tax or other liability imposed
upon Seller as a result of any failure or refusal by any Governmental Entity
to accept such election.

(c) Purchaser (or the Affiliate of Purchaser acquiring the Canadian Business)
and Seller shall, promptly after the Closing Date, jointly execute an election
under section 22 of the Income Tax Act, section 184 of the Taxation Act
(Quebec), and the corresponding provisions of any applicable provincial or
territorial Tax legislation, with respect to the sale of the accounts
receivable included in the assets of the Canadian Business (the "Accounts
Receivable") and shall 

 



85  designate therein the portion of the Transaction Consideration allocated to
the Accounts Receivable pursuant to Section 2.4 as the consideration paid by
the Affiliate of Purchaser acquiring the Canadian Business for the Accounts
Receivable. The Seller and the Affiliate of Purchaser acquiring the Canadian
Business shall each file such elections promptly after the execution thereof
(and, in any event, with their respective Tax Returns for the taxation year
in which the Closing Date occurs).

(d) Purchaser shall cause the Affiliate of Purchaser acquiring the Canadian
Business to be duly registered for the purposes of the HST Act and the QST Act
by the Closing.

14.2 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties would be damaged
irreparably in the event any provision of this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached and that money
damages would not be a sufficient remedy therefor. In the event of any breach
or threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to
seek and obtain (i) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (ii) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

(b) Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 14.2, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

(c) Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for breach
of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available to
a Party at law or equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific
performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit such Parties from
recovery of monetary damages against the other Party and/or from terminating
this Agreement.

14.3 _Release_. As of the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, and each
Group Company and the Canadian Business, on the other hand (each of Seller
and the Group Companies, a " _Releasing Person_ "), hereby releases and
forever discharges the other Releasing Persons and their past, present and
future direct or indirect equityholders, successors and assigns and all of
their respective Affiliates and Representatives (in each case, solely in their
capacities as such) (each, a " _Released Person_ ") from all debts, demands,
causes of action, suits, covenants, torts,

 



87  damages and any and all claims, defenses, offsets, judgments, demands and
liabilities whatsoever, of every name and nature, both at Law and in equity,
known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued, which have been or could have been
asserted against any Released Person, which any Releasing Person has or ever
had, which arises out of or in any way relates to events, circumstances or
actions occurring, existing or taken prior to or as of the Closing Date
whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the Closing
Date; _provided_ , that the Releasing Persons acknowledge and agree that this
Section 14.3 does not apply to and shall not constitute a release of any
rights or obligations arising under this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents.

14.4 _Acknowledgement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Drinker Biddle
and Reath LLP is representing the Group Companies and various of their direct or
indirect equityholders, including the Seller, and its respective Affiliates
and the Group Companies in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, following the Closing, it may continue to represent
Seller and its Affiliates (not including the Group Companies) in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in connection
with any disputes that may arise under this Agreement and/or any of the other
Transaction Documents. Drinker Biddle and Reath LLP shall not be precluded from
or restricted from representing Seller or any of its Affiliates (not
including the Group Companies) or otherwise acting as attorneys for any Seller
or any of its Affiliates (not including the Group Companies) in any matter,
including any court proceeding or other matter related to this
Agreement and/or any of the other Transaction Documents and/or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Parties irrevocably consent
to any such representation and waive any conflict or appearance of conflict
with respect to any such representation.

14.5 _Disclosure Letter_. The information in the Disclosure Letters
constitutes (i) exceptions or qualifications to representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations of the Group Companies, Seller and Purchaser as set
forth in this Agreement or (ii) descriptions or lists of assets and
liabilities and other items referred to in this Agreement. Any disclosure
made in any Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall be deemed to be
disclosures made with respect to all representations, warranties and sections
of the Disclosure Letters contained in this Agreement, regardless of whether
or not a specific cross-reference is made thereto, but only to the extent that
the relevance of such disclosure to such other representations, warranties and
the Disclosure Letters is reasonably apparent on its face. Information
included in or referenced in either the Purchasers Disclosure Letter or the
Companies Disclosure Letter that are made available to the "clean team"
established pursuant to the Clean Team Agreement shall be deemed to be
included in any such item that is referenced in either such Disclosure
Letter, so long as the applicable Schedule contains a clear reference to such
information and the fact that it is in the clean room. The Disclosure Letters
shall not be construed as indicating that any disclosed information is
required to be disclosed, and no disclosure shall be construed as an admission
that such information is material to, or required to be disclosed by the Group
Companies, Seller or Purchaser. The Group Companies, Seller or Purchaser may,
at their or its option, include in the Disclosure Letters items that are not
material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any
references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or
representation that such items are material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
this Agreement. No disclosure on the Disclosure Letters relating to a possible
breach or violation of any Contract or Law shall be

 



88  construed as an admission or indication that a breach or violation exists or
has actually occurred. The Disclosure Letters constitute a part of this
Agreement and are incorporated into this Agreement for all purposes as if
fully set forth herein. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Letters that
are not defined therein shall have the meanings given them in this Agreement.

 

14.6 _Dollar and Other Thresholds_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, (a) the specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any
item in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any
exhibits, schedules or attachments hereto is not intended to imply that the
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or
other items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such
amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or
are within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and (b) no Party
shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion
of any item in this Agreement or any exhibits, schedules or attachments hereto
in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described or included in this Agreement or in
any section of any exhibits, schedules or attachments hereto is or is not
required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the
ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The information
contained in this Agreement and in exhibits, schedules or attachments hereto
is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party
to any other Person of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of any
Law or breach of Contract).

 

14.7 _Neutral Construction_. In view of the fact that each Party has been
represented by its own counsel and this Agreement has been fully negotiated
by all Parties, the legal principle that ambiguities in a document are
construed against the draftsperson of that document shall not apply to this
Agreement.

 

14.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (and may be delivered by facsimile transmission or in portable
document format (.pdf)), all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

14.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and the instruments referred to herein), the other
Transaction Documents, the Clean Team Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is not intended and shall not be
deemed to confer upon or give any Person except the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns any remedy, claim, cause of
action or other right under or by reason of this Agreement, except the present
and former officers and directors of the Group Companies and their respective
heirs, executors, and spouses shall be deemed to be third-party beneficiaries
of this Agreement with respect to Section 9.8. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, each Debt Financing Source is intended to be, and
shall be, an express third-party beneficiary of this Section 14.9 and
Sections 14.10, 14.11, 14.15, 14.16 and 14.17.

 



89 14.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, except that, without obtaining the prior written consent of any
Party, Purchaser shall be entitled to assign all or any portion of its rights
or obligations hereunder (a) as collateral security to any Person (or any
agent or representative thereof) providing financing to Purchaser , (b) to any
of its Affiliates, or (c) in connection with a merger, consolidation or sale
of all or substantially all of the assets of Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_
, that no assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of any of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

14.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may only be amended by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of Purchaser and the Seller;  _provided_ , that no
amendment or waiver to this Section 14.11 or Sections 14.9, 14.10, 14.11,
14.15, 14.16 or 14.17 or defined term used therein that is adverse to any Debt
Financing Source shall be effective as to such Debt Financing Source without
the consent of such Debt Financing Source.

14.12 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the Parties may,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or the other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations or warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such Party.

14.13 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be materially
and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable,
(b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the
remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect
and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision
or by its severance from this Agreement and (d) in lieu of such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a
part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in
terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

14.14  _Time is of the Essence_. The Parties hereby expressly acknowledge and
agree that with regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to
in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

 

14.15 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.
THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK FOR CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO AND TO BE
PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF LAW
PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR ANY
OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY
JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF

 



90  NEW YORK AND WITH FEDERAL LAW, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE; IT BEING UNDERSTOOD
AND AGREED, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THAT ANY RIGHT OR OBLIGATION WITH
RESPECT TO ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE
COMMITMENT LETTER AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY, AND
ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE, SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING THERETO
OR ARISING THEREUNDER, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, IF JURISDICTION IS NOT AVAILABLE IN SUCH COURT,
THEN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE STATE
OF NEW YORK, FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ALL LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE COMMITMENT LETTER AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY) (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE).
EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE
OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.
EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (INCLUDING IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THE COMMITMENT LETTER AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
THEREBY) (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

14.16 _Non-Recourse_. Except as expressly set forth herein or in any other
documents delivered pursuant hereto, this Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any action for breach of this Agreement may only be made against,
the entities that are expressly identified herein as Parties; it being
understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that no Debt Financing Source shall
have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party
against its owners or affiliates) to any Party to this Agreement for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or
their negotiation or execution.

14.17 _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Seller (on behalf of itself and its affiliates and each
officer, director, employee, member, manager, partner, controlling person,
advisor, attorney, agent and representative thereof), solely in its capacity
as a party to this Agreement, (i) hereby waives any claims or rights against
any Debt Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or
arrangers in connection with the financing of the transactions contemplated
hereby, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in
equity and whether in tort, contract

 



91  or otherwise, (ii) hereby agrees not to commence any suit, action or
proceeding against any Debt Financing Source, solely in their respective
capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the financing of the
transactions contemplated hereby, in connection with this Agreement, the
Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
whether at law or in equity and whether in tort, contract or otherwise,
and (iii) hereby agrees to cause any suit, action or proceeding asserted
against any Debt Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as
lenders or arrangers in connection with the financing of the transactions
contemplated hereby, by or on behalf of the Seller, any of its affiliates or
any officer, director, employee, member, manager, partner, controlling person,
advisor, attorney, agent and representative thereof in connection with this
Agreement, the Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby to be dismissed or otherwise terminated. The Debt Financing Sources,
solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection
with the financing of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall not have
any rights or claims against the Seller or any related person thereof, in
connection with this Agreement or the Financing, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section shall not amend or impinge the Sellers rights under any separate
agreements between the Seller and any Debt Financing Source.
