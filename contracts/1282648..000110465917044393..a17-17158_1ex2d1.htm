Time"), as described below.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall be entitled to the allocable share of all Hydrocarbon
production allocable to the Combined Properties at and after the Effective
Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other

Assets at or after the Effective Time, and Purchaser shall be responsible for
(and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Costs incurred at
and after the Effective Time. Sellers shall be entitled to their (and the
Companies) allocable share of all Hydrocarbon production from or attributable
to the Combined Properties prior to the Effective Time (and all products and
proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income, proceeds, receipts
and credits earned with respect to the Combined Assets prior to the Effective
Time, and Sellers shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with
respect to) all Property Costs incurred prior to the Effective Time, subject

(i) As used in this Agreement, the terms "earned" and "incurred" shall be
interpreted in accordance with GAAP and Council of Petroleum Accountants
Society ("COPAS") standards, as applicable.

 



 

(ii) As used in this Agreement, the term "Property Costs" means all costs
payable by Seller or its Affiliates to Third Parties or any Seller (or any of
its Affiliates) acting as operator of any of the Combined Assets (in each
case) that are attributable to the ownership, development, exploration or
operation of the Combined Assets (including without limitation Asset Taxes,
but excluding any other Taxes) and capital expenditures payable by Seller or
its Affiliates to Third Parties or to any Seller acting as operator of any of
the Combined Assets (in each case) incurred in the ownership, development,
exploration or operation of the Combined Assets; provided that the term

of Sellers and/or the Companies and shall not include (A) any Losses for which
Sellers have agreed to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Purchaser
Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement, (B) any costs associated with
any debt for borrowed money of Sellers or any of their Affiliates (including

working interests, royalties, overriding royalties or other interest owners
revenues or proceeds attributable to sales of Hydrocarbons relating to the
Combined Assets, including those held in suspense.

 



 

(iii) For purposes of this **Section 1.4**, determination of whether Property
Costs are attributable to the period before or after the Effective Time shall
be based on when services are rendered, when the goods are delivered, or when
the work is performed. For clarification, the date an item or work is ordered
is not the date of a pre-Effective Time transaction for settlement purposes,
but rather the date on which the item ordered is delivered to the job site, or
the date on which the work ordered is performed, shall be the relevant date.
For purposes of allocating Hydrocarbon production (and accounts receivable
with respect thereto), under this **Section 1.4**, (x) liquid Hydrocarbons
shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Combined Properties when
such Hydrocarbons are placed into the storage facilities and (y) gaseous
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Combined
Properties when such

 



      
 

 



 

Hydrocarbons pass through the delivery point sales meters on the pipelines
through which they are transported.

 



 

(iv) Sellers shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an
allocation of Hydrocarbon production when exact meter readings or gauging and
strapping data is not available. Sellers shall provide to Purchaser, no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, all data necessary to support
any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to **Section 2.2** hereof that will be used to
determine the Closing Payment. Property Costs that are paid periodically shall
be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable period falling
before and the number of days in the applicable period falling at or after the
Effective Time, except that Hydrocarbon production, severance and similar
Taxes shall be prorated based on the number of units actually produced,
purchased or sold or proceeds of sale, as applicable, before, and at or after,
the Effective Time. In each case, Purchaser shall be responsible for the
portion allocated to the period at and after the Effective Time and Sellers
shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period before the
Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 1.5** **_Delivery and Maintenance of Records_**. Sellers shall
deliver electronic copies of the Records and Company Records to Purchaser
within ten (10) Business Days following Closing. Other than any Records or
Company Records retained by any of the Sellers pursuant to **Section
1.2(i)**, Purchaser shall be entitled to all original Records and Company
Records maintained by any of Sellers or any of their Affiliates, which shall
be delivered by Sellers to Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days following
the termination of the Transition Services Agreement. Sellers shall be
entitled to keep copies of all Records and Company Records. Purchaser shall
preserve the Records and Company Records for a period of three (3) years
following the Closing and will allow Sellers and their respective
representatives, consultants and advisors reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the Records and Company Records
in order for a Seller to comply with a Tax reporting obligation or Tax
dispute. Any such access shall be at the sole cost and expense of such Seller.
Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Sellers for a period of three (3)
years following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not and shall cause its
Affiliates, its permitted transferees, designees and assigns hereunder not to
destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of the Records or Company Records, or any
portions thereof, without first giving at least thirty (30) days prior written
notice to Sellers and offering to surrender to Sellers the Records and Company
Records or such portions thereof.

ownership and operation of the Combined Assets which are paid by Sellers
and/or a Company and incurred during the Adjustment Period (including any
overhead costs under **_Schedule 1.4_** deemed charged to the Combined Assets

however, to the collective interest of Sellers and Companies in the Combined
Assets), except any Property Costs already deducted in the determination of
proceeds in **Section 2.2(a)**;

 



 

(e) Reduced by the amount of all Property Costs attributable to the ownership
and operation of the Combined Assets which are paid by Purchaser and incurred

payments or other burdens on or payable out of production, gathering,
processing and transportation costs and any production, severance, sales,
excise or similar Taxes not reimbursed to Purchaser or Companies by the
purchaser of production) produced from or attributable to the Combined
Properties prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) other proceeds earned and
received by Purchaser or the Companies or their Affiliates (with respect to
the Companies, to the extent received after Closing) with respect to the

Combined Properties excluded pursuant to **Section 3.4(d)(iii)** and reduced
to the extent provided in **Section 4.3** for Environmental Defects;

belong to Sellers and/or a Company as of the Effective Time (which value shall
be computed by Sellers at the applicable third-party contract prices for the
month of May 2017 for such stored Hydrocarbons);

 



 

(k) (x) Reduced by the product obtained by multiplying the aggregate amount of
negative gas Imbalances by $3.00 per MMBtu; and (y) increased by the product
obtained by multiplying the aggregate amount of positive gas Imbalances by

(o) Increased by the amount, in accordance with the relevant operating or unit
agreement, if any, of all overhead costs charged to the Combined Assets under
the relevant operating or unit agreement, if any, and regardless of whether

amounts shown under **_Schedule 1.4_** (net, however, to the collective
interest of Sellers and Companies in the Combined Assets);

 



 

(p) Increased by all out-of-pocket amounts paid by any Seller Hedging Party in
connection with any Hedging Transaction between the date of this Agreement and
Closing;

 



 

(q) Reduced by all proceeds received by any Seller Hedging Party under any
Hedging Transaction between the date of this Agreement and Closing;

capacity as operator of any of the Combined Assets, as advance payments for
use in approved development and/or operations of the Combined Assets, solely
to the extent such advanced amounts have not been spent by any Seller or its
Affiliates as of the Closing; and

 



 

(s) Each adjustment made pursuant to **Section 2.2(a)** shall serve to
satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchasers entitlement under
**Section 1.4** to (i) Hydrocarbon

 



      
 

 



 

production from or attributable to the Combined Properties during the
Adjustment Period, and (ii) the value of other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits earned with respect to the Combined Assets during the Adjustment
Period, and as such, Purchaser shall not have any separate rights to receive
any Hydrocarbon production or income, proceeds, receipts and credits with
respect to which an adjustment has been made. Similarly, the adjustment
described in **Section 2.2(d)** shall serve to satisfy, up to the amount of
the adjustment, Purchasers obligation under **Section 1.4** to pay Property
Costs and other costs attributable to the ownership and operation of the
Combined Assets which are incurred during the Adjustment Period.

 



 

 **Section 2.3** **_Allocation of Purchase Price_**.

 



 

(a) The Allocated Values attributable to the Combined Assets are contained in
**Exhibit A-1** and **Exhibit C**. Purchaser shall be responsible for
assigning the Allocated Values included on **Exhibit A-1** and **Exhibit
C**, subject to Sellers right to review the Allocated Values for
reasonableness.

 



 

(b) The Purchase Price (plus Assumed Seller Obligations, to the extent
properly taken into account under the Code), shall be allocated among the
Combined Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law, as appropriate) (the "Allocation"). The Allocation shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the Allocated Values and shall be
delivered by Purchaser to Sellers thirty (30) days after determination of the
Final Purchase Price pursuant to **Section 9.4(b)** for Sellers approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Sellers and Purchaser shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes
relating to the Allocation. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to resolve any
such dispute, such dispute shall be resolved promptly by a nationally
recognized accounting firm acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers, the costs of
which shall be borne by equally. If the Purchase Price is adjusted, the
Allocation shall be adjusted as mutually agreed by Purchaser and Sellers.
Purchaser and Sellers shall file all Tax Returns (including, but not limited
to, Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) consistent with the Allocation.
Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall take any Tax position inconsistent with
such Allocation and neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall agree to any proposed
adjustment to the Allocation by any Tax Authority without first giving the
other party prior written notice; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall prevent Purchaser or Sellers from settling any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority based upon or arising out of the
Allocation, and neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall be required to litigate
before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority
challenging such Allocation.

Million Dollars ($140,000,000.00) (together with all interest earned thereon,
the "Deposit") shall be paid, on or before the 2nd Business Day following the
execution of this Agreement, by Purchaser, by wire transfer to the Escrow
Agent in immediately available funds. If Purchaser fails to make the Deposit
within the time period specified in the immediately preceding sentence,
Sellers shall have the right thereafter to terminate this Agreement upon
written notice to Purchaser. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Deposit pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement. The Deposit shall be credited to the Purchase Price
to be paid by Purchaser at the Closing. The Parties shall provide written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to Sellers in the
event the

 



      
 

 



 

transaction contemplated hereby is not consummated in accordance with the
terms hereof; provided, however, if the transaction contemplated hereby is not
consummated due to material breach of Sellers representations, warranties or
obligations hereunder, the failure of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of Purchaser in **Section 8.2** to be satisfied, or due to
Purchasers termination of this Agreement in accordance with **Section
10.1(b)(ii)** or **Section 10.1(d)**, then the Parties shall provide written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay the full amount of the Deposit to
Purchaser in readily available funds.

provides affirmative evidence that such failure would result in another
Persons superior claim of title;

 



 

(iv) defects based on a gap in Sellers or any of the Companys chain of title

affirmatively shown to exist in such records by an abstract of title, title
opinion or landmans title chain which documents shall be included in a Title
Defect Notice;

 



 

(v) defects arising out of lack of survey, unless a survey is expressly
required by applicable Laws;

 



 

(vi) defects in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite marital
status in a document or omissions of successions of heirship or estate
proceedings, unless Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

provides affirmative evidence that such failure or omission has resulted in
another Persons superior claim of title; and

 



 

(vii) defects that have been cured by applicable Laws of limitation or
prescription.

 



 

As used in this Agreement, the term "Title Benefit" shall mean any right,
circumstance or condition that operates to increase the Net Revenue Interest
of Sellers (or the Companies, as applicable) in any Subject Well, as

in **Exhibit A-1 **and/or **Exhibit C**, as applicable, or increase Sellers
(or the Companies, as applicable) working interest above that shown in
**Exhibit A-1 **and/or **Exhibit C**, as applicable, without a proportionate

 **Section 3.4** **_Notice of Title Defect Adjustments_**.

 



 

(a) To assert a claim of a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver written claim
notices to Sellers (each a "Title Defect Notice") on or before August 29,
2017, at 5:00 p.m. C.D.T. (the "Title Claim Date"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Purchaser agrees that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
furnish Sellers once every calendar week until the Title Claim Date with a
preliminary Title Defect Notice if any officer of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates discovers or learns of any Title Defect during the previous one (1)
week period, which notice may be supplemented prior to the Title Claim Date.
To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall
include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) Subject Units
and/or Subject Wells, as applicable in **Exhibit A-1** and/or **Exhibit C**
affected by the Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (iii) the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Sellers (as well as any title attorney or examiner
hired by Sellers) to verify the existence of and extent of the alleged Title
Defect(s) and the amount by which the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s), and (v) the amount by
which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations and
information upon which Purchasers belief is based. The burden of proof
regarding the existence of any Title Defect shall always remain with
Purchaser. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE
CONTRARY, EXCEPT FOR PURCHASERS RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY BREACH BY
SELLERS OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR COVENANTS CONTAINED HEREIN,
PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO ASSERT TITLE DEFECTS OF
WHICH EACH SELLER HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN A TITLE DEFECT NOTICE ON OR BEFORE THE
TITLE CLAIM DATE. For purposes hereof, the "Allocated Value" of an Asset shall
mean the portion of the Purchase Price that has been allocated to a

 



      
 

 



 

particular Subject Well, as applicable in **Section 2.3** and/or **Exhibits
A-1** and ** C** as prepared by Purchaser and reviewed for reasonableness by
Sellers.

 



 

(b) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to
Purchaser on or before the Title Claim Date, with respect to each Title
Benefit, a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including (i) a description of
the Title Benefit, (ii) the Subject Units or Subject Wells, as applicable in
**Exhibit A-1** or **Exhibit C **affected, (iii) the Allocated Values of the
Subject Units or Subject Wells in **Exhibit A-1** or **Exhibit C **subject
to such Title Benefit, and (iv) the amount by which Sellers reasonably believe
the Allocated Value of those Subject Units or Subject Wells, as applicable is
increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations and information upon
which Sellers belief is based.

 



 

(c) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at their
sole cost, to cure or remove Title Defects at any time prior to Closing (the
"Cure Period"), and unless the parties otherwise agree, any Title Defects of
which Sellers have been advised in writing by Purchaser. Except for
Purchasers rights under this Agreement for any breach by Seller of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein, any asserted Title
Defects which are cured within the Cure Period or waived or deemed waived by
Purchaser shall be deemed Permitted Encumbrances hereunder.

 



 

(d) Remedies for Title Defects. In the event that any Title Defect is not
waived in writing by Purchaser or cured on or before Closing, Sellers shall
elect to have one of the following remedies apply:

 



 

(i) subject to the Individual Title Threshold and the Aggregate Defect
Deductible, have the Purchase Price reduced by an amount agreed upon ("Title
Defect Amount") pursuant to **Section 3.4(g)** by Purchaser and Sellers as
being the value of such Title Defect, taking into consideration the Allocated
Value of the Combined Property subject to such Title Defect, the portion of
the Combined Property subject to such Title Defect and the legal effect of
such Title Defect on the Combined Property affected thereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the methodology, terms and conditions of **Section 3.4(g)**
shall control any such determination;

 



 

(ii) to the extent that Purchaser consents in writing (which consent may be
made in Purchasers sole discretion), indemnify Purchaser against all
liability, loss, cost and expense resulting from such Title Defect pursuant to
an indemnity agreement (the "Indemnity Agreement") in the form mutually agreed
to by the parties; or

 



 

(iii) retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property (or, if such Title
Defect Property is a Company Property, convey such Company Property to Sellers
in accordance with **Section 7.10)**, together with all associated Combined
Assets, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such Combined Property; provided, however that
Sellers can only select the remedy set forth in this **Section 3.4(d)(iii)**
to the extent that either (i) the Title Defect asserted is based on the
reasons described in **Section 3.2(c)(i)**, regardless of the asserted or
alleged Title Defect Amount related thereto, or (ii) the asserted Title Defect
Amount with respect to such Title Defect Property exceeds 80% of the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property. Thereafter, Sellers, at their option (not
obligation), shall have 180 days after Closing in which to cure the Title
Defect with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

such retained Combined Properties. Any Combined Property so held back from the
initial Closing, if cured to Purchasers reasonable satisfaction, will be
conveyed to Purchaser at a delayed Closing (which shall become the new Closing
Date with respect to such Combined Property) within ten (10) days following
the date that the Title Defect is cured, at which time Purchaser shall pay to
Sellers the full Allocated Value of the Combined Property (as adjusted
pursuant to **Section 2.2 **to the extent applicable to such Combined
Property), and provided further that if multiple delayed Closings are
contemplated as a result of this provision and/or **Section 7.7(c)**, the
delayed Closings may be consolidated on dates mutually agreeable to the
parties. An election to delay the Closing with respect to any such Combined
Property pursuant to this **(iii)** shall not waive Sellers right to dispute
the existence of a Title Defect or to contest the Title Defect Amount asserted
with respect thereto. In the event that Sellers are unable to cure the Title
Defect within 180 days of the initial Closing, then Sellers shall, at their
sole election, select one of the two remedies set forth in subsection (i) or
(ii) above (subject to obtaining Purchasers consent with respect to the
remedy set forth in subsection (ii) above). Should Sellers choice ultimately
lead to application of **Section 3.4(k)**, the Title Expert shall be selected
within fifteen (15) Business Days of the end of this 180 day cure period. All
other provisions of **Section 3.4(k)** shall apply as written.

 



 

In the event Sellers select the remedy set forth in subsection (i) above, and
Purchaser and Sellers are unable to agree on the Title Defect Amount, the
affected Combined Assets will nevertheless be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing
with the reduction in the Purchase Price for such Title Defect to be the Title
Defect Amount asserted by Purchaser in good faith, subject to the parties
right to a subsequent adjustment in the Purchase Price for such Title Defect
as may result under the provisions of **Section 3.4(k)**, or as may otherwise
be agreed to by the parties.

 



 

(e) With respect to each Subject Well, as applicable in **Exhibit A-1** or
**Exhibit C **affected by Title Benefits reported under **Section 3.4(b)**,
the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount (the "Title Benefit
Amount") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Subject Well,
as applicable in **Exhibit A-1** or **Exhibit C **caused by such Title
Benefits, as determined pursuant to **Section 3.4(j)**.

 



 

(f) Except with regard to Purchasers rights under this Agreement for any
breach by any of the Sellers of their representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein, **Section 3.4(d)** shall be the exclusive right and remedy
of Purchaser with respect to Title Defects asserted by Purchaser pursuant to
**Section 3.4(a)** and **Section 3.4(e)** shall be the exclusive right and
remedy of Sellers with respect to Title Benefits asserted by Sellers pursuant
to **Section 3.4(b)**. Notwithstanding anything stated in this Agreement to
the contrary, any recovery of damages with respect to any such breaches by
Sellers of their representations, warranties or covenants contained herein
shall be without duplication of any Title Defect Amounts for any Title Defect
which Purchaser asserted under **Section 3.4(a)** and Purchaser shall be
bound by the provisions of **Section 7.3** with respect to any such breaches
of such representations, warranties and covenants, if applicable.

 



 

(g) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount
by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property is reduced as a
result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in
accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 



       
 

 



 

(i) if Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect
Property;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Defect results from Sellers having a lesser Net Revenue
Interest in such Title Defect Property than the Net Revenue Interest specified
therefor in **Exhibit A-1** or **Exhibit C**, the Title Defect Amount shall
be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the portion of the Purchase
Price allocated to such Title Defect Property on **Exhibit A-1** or **Exhibit
C**, as applicable by a fraction, the numerator of which is the reduction in
the Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest specified for such Title Defect Property in **Exhibit A-1** or
**Exhibit C**, as applicable;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Defect results from any matter not described in subsections
(i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount equal to
the difference between the value of the Title Defect Property affected by such
Title Defect with such Title Defect and the value of such Title Defect
Property without such Title Defect (taking into account the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated in **Section 2.3** and/or **Exhibit A-1** or
**Exhibit C** to such Title Defect Property);

 



 

(v) if a Title Defect is not effective or does not affect a Title Defect
Property throughout the entire remaining productive life of such Title Defect
Property, such fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title
Defect Amount; and

 



 

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this **Article 3**, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
the Title Defect Property.

 



 

(h) The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder. For example, if a lien affects more than one
Title Defect Property or the curative work with respect to one Title Defect
results in the curing of any other Title Defect affecting the same or another
Title Defect Property, the amount necessary to discharge such lien or the cost
and expense of such curative work shall be allocated among the Title Defect
Properties so affected (in the ratios of the respective portions of the
Purchase Price allocated to such Title Defect Properties) and the amount so
allocated to a Title Defect Property shall be included only once in the Title
Defect Amount.

 



 

(i) No Title Defect Amount shall be allowed on account of and to the extent
that an increase in a Sellers working interest in a Property has the effect
of proportionately increasing such Sellers Net Revenue Interest in such
Property;

 



 

(j) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall mean, with respect to
an affected Subject Well, as applicable, the amount by which the value of the
affected Subject Well, as applicable is enhanced by virtue of Sellers having a
greater Net Revenue Interest in such Subject Well, as applicable than the Net
Revenue Interest specified therefor in **Exhibit A-1 **or

 



      
 

 

 ** **

 

 **Exhibit C** (without causing a greater than proportionate increase in
Sellers working interest above that shown in **Exhibit A-1** or **Exhibit C
**as of the Effective Time), which amount shall be determined as follows:

 



 

(i) If Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Benefit Amount, that agreed
amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount.

 



 

(ii) If the Title Benefit Amount results from a Seller having a greater Net
Revenue Interest in such Subject Well, as applicable, than the Net Revenue
Interest specified therefor in **Exhibit A-1** or **Exhibit C,** the Title
Benefit Amount shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the
portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Subject Well, as applicable in
**Section 2.3**, **Exhibit A-1** or **Exhibit C **by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the increase in the Net Revenue Interest and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest specified for Subject Well,
as applicable in **Exhibit A-1** or **Exhibit C**

 



 

(iii) In determining the amount of Title Benefit Amounts, the principles and
methodology set forth in **Section 3.4(g)** shall generally be applied,
_mutatis mutandis_.

 



 

(k) Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree on all Title
Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts prior to the Scheduled Closing Date.
If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to agree by the Scheduled Closing Date
(and for purposes of Title Defect Amounts, Sellers have elected the remedy set
forth in **Section 3.4(d)(i)**) and the conditions to Closing set forth in
**Section 8.1(f)** and **Section 8.2(f)** have been satisfied or waived,
then (i) the affected Title Defect Property shall nevertheless be conveyed at
Closing, (ii) the amount to be paid to Sellers at Closing shall be reduced by
Purchasers good faith estimate of the Title Defect Amount or Sellers good
faith estimate of the Title Benefit Amount, as applicable, and (iii) the Title
Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and
finally resolved pursuant to this **Section 3.4(k)**. There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10) years
experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in
which the Properties and/or Company Properties are located, as selected by
mutual agreement of Purchaser and Sellers within seven (7) Business Days after
the Scheduled Closing Date (subject to the following proviso, the "Title
Expert"); provided, that if the parties are unable to agree upon such
arbitrator with in such time period, then either party may request that the
American Arbitration Association Houston office choose such arbitrator. The
Title Experts determination shall be made within twenty (20) Business Days
after his/her appointment and shall be final and binding upon all parties,
without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title Expert shall
be bound by the rules set forth in **Section 3.4(g)** and **Section 3.4(h)**
and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Expert are
necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Title Expert may
allow the parties to make written submissions of their positions in the manner
and to the extent the Title Expert deems appropriate, and the Title Expert may
call on the parties to submit such other materials as the Title Expert deems
helpful and appropriate to resolution of the dispute. Additionally, the Title
Expert may consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the
arbitrator, including without limitation petroleum engineers. The Title Expert
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
disputed Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts submitted by either
party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any party with
respect to any matter. Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal
fees and other

 



      
 

 



 

costs of presenting its case. The costs and expenses of the Title Expert shall
be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by Purchaser, including any
costs incurred by the Title Expert that are attributable to such third party
consultation. Within ten (10) days after the Title Expert delivers written
notice to Purchaser and Sellers of his award with respect to a Title Defect
Amount or a Title Benefit Amount, the party owing the other party shall pay to
the other party the amount determined by the Title Expert taking into account
any adjustments to the Purchase Price made as of the Closing.

 



 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be
any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers
for any individual uncured Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount
therefor does not exceed $150,000 ("Individual Title Threshold"); and (ii) in
no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Sellers for uncured Title Defects unless the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to all uncured Title Defects, taken together
with the aggregate Environmental Defect Amounts attributable to all uncured
Environmental Defects, exceeds a deductible in an amount equal to 2.0% of the
unadjusted Purchase Price ("Aggregate Defect Deductible"), after which point
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies shall be made available to
Purchaser only with respect to uncured Title Defects and uncured Environmental
Defects where the aggregate Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect
Amounts are in excess of such Aggregate Defect Deductible; for the avoidance
of doubt, Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts which do not
meet the Individual Title Threshold and the Individual Environmental Threshold
shall not be included in reaching the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

 



 

 **Section 3.5** **_Casualty or Condemnation Loss_**.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, but subject to the provisions of
**Section 3.5(b)** below, Purchaser shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to any change in the condition of the Assets and for production of
Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including but not limited to the
watering out of any Company Well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any
Company Well) and the depreciation of personal property due to ordinary wear
and tear with respect to the Combined Assets.

 



 

(b) If, after the execution of this Agreement but prior to the Closing, all or
any part of any of the Combined Assets are damaged or destroyed by fire,
flood, storm or other casualty or are taken in condemnation or under the right
of eminent domain, or if proceedings for such purposes shall be pending or
threatened, Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing of the nature
and extent of the casualty loss or government taking and Sellers estimate of
the cost required to repair or replace that portion of the Combined Assets
affected by the casualty loss or value of the Combined Assets taken by the
government. If all or any portion of the Combined Assets are affected by a
casualty loss or government taking, the Purchase Price will be adjusted
downward by the agreed cost of the casualty loss or the agreed value of the
Combined Assets taken by the government, and the parties will proceed with
Closing, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement. To the
extent that the parties are unable to agree upon the cost of any casualty loss
or the value of such taking, then the parties shall submit the dispute to the
Title Expert to decide and the provisions of **Section 3.4(k)** shall apply
as if such casualty loss or

 



      
 

 



 

taking was a Title Defect (for the avoidance of doubt, without regard to any
threshold or deductible amount).

 



 

 **Section 3.6** **_Limitations on Applicability_**. Without limiting
Purchasers rights under this Agreement for any breach by Sellers of their
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein (subject to the
limitations set forth in **Section 3.4(f)** above) or for any breach of the
special warranty of title contained in the Conveyance, the right of Purchaser
to assert a Title Defect under this Agreement and Sellers rights to assert a
Title Benefit under this Agreement shall terminate as of the Title Claim Date,
provided there shall be no termination of Purchasers or Sellers rights under
**Section 3.4** with respect to any bona fide Title Defect properly reported
in a Title Defect Notice or bona fide Title Benefit Claim properly reported in
a Title Benefit Notice on or before the Title Claim Date.

 



 

 **Section 3.7** **_Government Approvals Respecting Assets_**.

 



 

(a) _Federal, Tribal and State Approvals_. Purchaser shall, within thirty (30)
days after Closing and at Purchasers own expense, file for approval with the
applicable Governmental Bodies all assignment documents and other state,
tribal, and federal transfer documents required to effectuate the transfer of
the Assets. Purchaser further agrees, promptly after Closing, to take all
other actions reasonably required of Purchaser by federal, tribal, or state
agencies having jurisdiction to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals with
respect to this transaction, and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the approval by such federal, tribal, or state agencies, as applicable,
of Sellers assignment documents requiring federal, tribal, or state approval
in order for Purchaser to be recognized by the federal, tribal, or state
agencies as the owner of the Assets. Purchaser shall provide Sellers with
approved copies of the assignment documents and other state, tribal, and
federal transfer documents, as soon as they are available.

 



 

(b) _Title Pending Governmental Approvals_. Until all of the governmental
approvals provided for in **Section 3.7(a)** have been obtained, the
following shall occur with respect to the affected portion of the Assets:

 



 

(i) Sellers shall continue to hold record title to the affected Leases and
other affected portion of the Assets as nominee for Purchaser;

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall be responsible for all Assumed Seller Obligations with
respect to the affected Leases and other affected portion of the Assets as if
Purchaser was the record owner of such Leases and other portion of the Assets
as of the Effective Time;

 



 

(iii) Sellers shall act as Purchasers nominee but shall be authorized to act
only upon and in accordance with Purchasers written instructions, and Sellers
shall have no authority, responsibility or discretion to perform any tasks or
functions with respect to the affected Leases and other affected portion of
the Assets other than those which are purely administrative or ministerial in
nature, unless otherwise specifically requested and authorized by Purchaser in
writing;

 



 

(iv) Sellers shall not be obligated to incur any expenses in Sellers capacity
as nominee for the benefit of Purchaser under this **Section 3.7(b)**, and
Purchaser agrees to pay or

 



      
 

 



 

reimburse Sellers for any such expenses payable to Third Parties that Sellers
have paid promptly upon receiving notice thereof; and

 



 

(v) For purposes of **Article 11**, Sellers and Purchaser shall treat and
deal with such affected Leases and other affected portions of the Assets as if
full legal and equitable title to the same had passed from Sellers to
Purchaser at Closing.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**

 



 

 **Section 4.1** **_Assessment_**. From and after the date of execution of
this Agreement until the Closing Date, Sellers shall afford to Purchaser and
its officers, employees, agents and authorized representatives reasonable
access to the Combined Assets. Upon reasonable notice to Sellers, Purchaser
shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I environmental property assessment of
the Combined Assets that satisfies the basic assessment requirements set forth
under the current American Society for Testing and Material Standard Practice
for Phase I environmental property assessments (Designation E1527-05) but such
Phase I environmental property assessment shall not include any environmental
sampling or testing (the "Phase I Assessment" or "Phase I, " whether one or
more). The Phase I Assessment and Purchasers other diligence activities shall
be conducted at the sole cost, risk and expense of Purchaser, and shall be
subject to the indemnity provisions of **Section 4.4**. Sellers or their
respective designee shall have the right to accompany Purchaser and
Purchasers representatives whenever they are onsite on Combined Assets and
also to collect split test samples if any are collected pursuant to a Phase II
Assessment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall
not have access to, and shall not be permitted to conduct any environmental
due diligence (including all or any part of the Phase I Assessments) with
respect to any Combined Assets where Sellers or their Affiliates do not have
the authority to grant access for such due diligence; _provided, however_ ,
Sellers and their Affiliates shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain permission from any other Person to allow Purchaser and Purchaser
representatives such access and as long as Sellers and their Affiliates have
exercised such commercially reasonable efforts, Sellers shall have no
liability to Purchaser for failure to obtain any such other Persons
permission. In the event that Purchasers Phase I Assessment identifies actual
or potential "Recognized Environmental Conditions," as such conditions are
defined or described under the current American Society for Testing and
Material Standard Practice Designation E1527-05, then Purchaser may request
Sellers consent to conduct Phase II environmental property assessments or
such other activities intended to constitute the conduct of "all appropriate
inquiries" under 30 CFR Part 312 (collectively, the "Phase II Assessment" or
"Phase II," whether one or more). The Phase II Assessment procedures and plan
concerning any additional investigation shall be submitted to Sellers in a
written environmental property assessment plan, and shall be reasonable based
on the Recognized Environmental Conditions identified by the Phase I
Assessment. Thereafter, Sellers may, in their sole discretion, approve said
environmental property assessment plan, in whole or in part, and Purchaser
shall not have the right to conduct any activities set forth in such plan
until such time that Seller has approved such plan in writing; provided that,
in the event of the Sellers rejection of said environmental property
assessment plan, in whole or in part, Purchaser (i) may still deliver an
Environmental Defect Notice with respect to such Combined Assets pursuant to
**Section 4.3** and (ii) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, may elect to have such Combined Assets excluded from the
transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated hereunder (and if such Combined Assets are Company Assets, then
the applicable Company shall assign such Combined Assets to Seller I, which
assignment shall be in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit E) **whereby
such Combined Asset shall be deemed an Excluded Asset or Company Excluded
Asset, as applicable. Any such approved environmental property assessment plan
shall be performed in accordance with this **Article 4** and in compliance
with all Laws. Purchaser and Sellers shall maintain, and shall cause their
respective officers, employees, representatives, consultants and advisors to
maintain, all information obtained by Purchaser pursuant to any Phase I, Phase
II or other due diligence activity as strictly confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement until the Closing occurs, or in the event that
Closing does not occur, in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
unless disclosure of any facts discovered through such Phase I, Phase II or
other due diligence activity is required under any Laws. Purchaser shall
provide Sellers with a copy of the final version of all environmental reports
prepared by, or on behalf of, Purchaser with respect to any Phase I, Phase II
or other environmental due diligence activity conducted on the Properties. In
the event that any necessary disclosures under applicable Laws are required
with respect to matters discovered by any Phase I, Phase II or other due
diligence activity conducted by, for or on behalf of Purchaser, Purchaser
agrees that Sellers shall be the responsible party for disclosing such matters
to the appropriate Governmental Bodies; _provided that_ , if Sellers fails to
promptly make such disclosure and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is
legally obligated to make such disclosure, such Person shall have the right to
fully comply with such legal obligation.

 



 

 **Section 4.2** **_NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_**. Purchaser
acknowledges that the Combined Assets have been used for the exploration,
development, and production of Hydrocarbons and that there may be petroleum,
produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on or
under the Properties or associated with the Combined Assets. Equipment and
sites included in the Combined Assets may contain Hazardous Materials,
including NORM. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells,
materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials,
and equipment located on, in or under the Properties or included in the
Combined Assets may contain Hazardous Materials, including NORM. Hazardous
Materials, including NORM, may have come in contact with various environmental
media, including without limitation, water, soils or sediment. Special
procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal,
transportation, or disposal of environmental media and Hazardous Materials,
including NORM, from the Combined Assets.

 



 

 **Section 4.3** **_Environmental Defects_**.

 



 

(a) If, as a result of its investigation pursuant to **Section 4.1**,
Purchaser determines that with respect to the Combined Assets, there exists a
violation of an Environmental Law or a reporting or remediation obligation
under Environmental Laws with respect to any Combined Asset that has not been
satisfied (in each case, an "Environmental Defect"), then on or prior to
August 29, 2017, at 5:00 p.m. C.D.T. (the "Environmental Claim Date"),
Purchaser may notify Sellers in writing of such Environmental Defect (an
"Environmental Defect Notice"). **FOR ALL PURPOSES OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT
FOR PURCHASER S RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY BREACH BY SELLERS OF
THEIR REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR COVENANTS CONTAINED HEREIN. PURCHASER
SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED ANY ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT WHICH PURCHASER FAILS
TO ASSERT AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL**

 



      
 

 

 ** **

 

 **DEFECT BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT NOTICE RECEIVED BY EACH SELLER ON OR
BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM DATE**. To be effective, each such notice must
set forth (i) a description of the matter constituting the alleged
Environmental Defect, (ii) the Combined Assets affected by the Environmental
Defect, as well as all Combined Assets used in connection with the ownership
or operation of such affected Combined Assets (as currently owned and
operated) (collectively, all of such Combined Assets, the " **Environmental
Defect Properties** "), (iii) the estimated Lowest Cost Response to eliminate
the Environmental Defect in question (the "Environmental Defect Amount"), and
(iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Sellers to verify the
existence of the alleged Environmental Defect and the Environmental Defect
Amount. Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish
Sellers once every calendar week until the Environmental Claim Date with a
preliminary Environmental Defect Notice if any officer of Purchaser or its
Affiliates discovers or becomes aware of an Environmental Defect during the
previous one (1) week period, which notice may be supplemented prior to the
Environmental Claim Date.

 



 

(b) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any
Environmental Defect before Closing or, provided that the parties shall have
mutually agreed to the general plan of remediation with respect to such
Environmental Defect and the time period by which such remediation shall take
place, after Closing. If Sellers disagree with any of Purchasers assertions
with respect to the existence of an Environmental Defect or the Environmental
Defect Amount, Purchaser and Sellers will attempt to resolve the dispute prior
to Closing. If the dispute cannot be resolved prior to the Scheduled Closing
Date, any party may submit the dispute to an environmental consultant approved
in writing by Sellers and Purchaser (which approval shall be made on or before
the 7th Business Day after the Scheduled Closing Date) that is experienced in
environmental corrective action at oil and gas properties in the relevant
jurisdiction and that shall not have performed professional services for
either party or any of their respective Affiliates during the previous three
(3) years (subject to the following proviso, the "Independent Expert");
provided that if the parties are unable to agree on such consultant within
such time period, then either party may request that the American Arbitration
Association Houston office chose such consultant. The Independent Expert may
elect to conduct the dispute resolution proceeding by written submissions from
Purchaser and Sellers with exhibits, including interrogatories, supplemented
with appearances by Purchaser and Sellers, if necessary, as the Independent
Expert may deem necessary and the Independent Expert shall call for a final,
written offer of resolution from each party. Within twenty (20) Business Days
of the appointment of the Independent Expert, the Independent Expert shall
render its decision regarding any Environmental Defect or Environmental Defect
Amount submitted to the Independent Expert. In no event shall the Independent
Expert establish an amount for an Environmental Defect that is greater than
the final written offer of Purchaser or lower than the final written offer of
Sellers. In the event the parties have failed to resolve any dispute regarding
an Environmental Defect at or prior to the Scheduled Closing Date and the
conditions to Closing set forth in **Section 8.1(f)** and **Section 8.2(f)**
have been satisfied or waived, then (subject to the last sentence of this
**Section 4.3(b)**) (i) with respect to any Assets that are Environmental
Defect Properties affected by such Environmental Defect, Sellers shall retain
any such Environmental Defect Properties, in which event the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset and
(ii) with respect to any Company Asset that are Environmental Defect
Properties affected by such Environmental Defect, the Company shall be sold
holding such Company Asset to Purchaser at Closing and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Environmental Defect Amount with respect thereto

 



      
 

 



 

asserted by Purchaser in good faith. Thereafter, the Independent Expert shall
render his decision regarding the Environmental Defect and the Purchase Price
for such retained Asset or the adjustment attributable to such Company Asset,
as applicable, subject to such Environmental Defect shall be reduced as
determined by the Independent Expert (taking into account any adjustments to
the Purchase Price therefor) or as otherwise agreed to by the parties and
Purchaser shall promptly pay to Sellers the full Allocated Value of the
Environmental Defect Properties (as adjusted pursuant to **Section 2.2** to
the extent applicable to such Environmental Defect Properties) less such
Environmental Defect Amount (if less than the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Properties) or Sellers shall promptly pay to Purchaser
the positive difference between the Allocated Value of such Asset (as adjusted
pursuant to **Section 2.2** to the extent applicable to such Environmental
Defect Properties) and such Environmental Defect Amount (if such Environmental
Defect Amount is greater than the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect
Properties). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Environmental Defect Amount for any Environmental Defect asserted by
Purchaser equals or exceeds the aggregate Allocated Value of the relevant
Environmental Defect Properties relating thereto, either Sellers, on one hand,
or Purchaser, on the other hand, upon written notice to the other within three
Business Days prior to the Scheduled Closing Date, shall have the option, in
its sole discretion, to exclude the relevant Environmental Defect Properties
(which, if part of the Assets, shall be retained by Sellers and become
Excluded Assets or, if part of the Company Assets, shall be assigned to
Sellers pursuant to the form of assignment attached as **Exhibit E** and
become Company Excluded Assets, as applicable), in which case the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of all of such excluded
Environmental Defect Properties.

 



 

(c) The Independent Expert may not award damages, interest or penalties to
either party with respect to any matter. The decision of the Independent
Expert shall be final and binding upon all parties, without right of appeal.
Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case to the Independent Expert. The costs and expenses of the
Independent Expert shall be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by
Purchaser. The parties shall adjust the Purchase Price to reflect the
Environmental Defect Amounts, as agreed by the parties or as determined by the
Independent Expert, for all uncured Environmental Defects; _provided that_ ,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any
adjustments to the Purchase Price for any individual uncured Environmental
Defect for which the Environmental Defect Amount therefor does not exceed
$150,000 ("Individual Environmental Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall
there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price for any uncured Environmental
Defect unless the aggregate Environmental Defect Amount attributable to all
such Environmental Defects, taken together with the aggregate Title Defect
Amounts attributable to all uncured Title Defects, exceeds the Aggregate
Defect Deductible, after which point Purchaser shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to
uncured Title Defects and uncured Environmental Defects where the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts attributable thereto are
in excess of such Aggregate Defect Deductible; for the avoidance of doubt,
Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts which do not meet the
Individual Title Threshold and the Individual Environmental Threshold shall
not be included in reaching the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

(b) Sellers shall notify Purchaser promptly after any Seller obtains Actual
Knowledge that any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date, or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date has not
been so performed or observed in any material respect.

 



 

(c) If any of Purchasers or Sellers representations or warranties is untrue
or shall become untrue in any material respect between the date of execution
of this Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any of Purchasers or Sellers
covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing
Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any material respect, but
if such breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if
curable) be cured by the Closing, then, so long as the non-breaching party
does not bear any cost, expense or liability associated therewith, such breach
shall be considered not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement.
No such notification in this Section shall affect the representations or
warranties of the parties or the conditions to their respective obligations
hereunder.

 



 

(d) There shall be no breach of the covenants in this Section as a result of a
partys failure to report a breach of any representation or warranty or a
failure to perform or observe any covenant or agreement of which it had Actual
Knowledge if the party subject to the breach or failure also had knowledge
thereof prior to Closing.

 



 

 **Section 7.4** **_Letters-in-Lieu; Assignments; Operatorship_**.

 



 

(a) Sellers will execute on the Closing Date letters in lieu of division and
transfer orders relating to the Combined Assets, on forms prepared by Sellers
and reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, to reflect the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Sellers will prepare and execute, and Purchaser will execute, on the
Closing Date, all assignments necessary to convey to Purchaser all federal and
state Leases in the form as prescribed by the applicable Governmental Body and
otherwise reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in **Article 5** , Sellers make no representations or
warranties to Purchaser, express, implied or by statute, as to transferability
or assignability of operatorship of any Seller Operated Assets. Rights and
obligations associated with operatorship of such Combined Properties are
governed by operating and similar agreements covering the Combined Properties
and will be determined in accordance with the terms of such agreements.
However, Sellers will assist Purchaser in Purchasers efforts to succeed
Sellers or any of Sellers Affiliates as operator of any Combined Assets.
Purchaser shall, promptly following Closing, file all appropriate forms and
declarations or bonds with federal and state agencies relative to its

 



      
 

 



 

assumption of operatorship where it is required by Law to do so. For all
Seller Operated Assets, Sellers and Purchaser shall execute the appropriate
forms on the Closing Date and Purchaser shall thereafter promptly file said
forms with the applicable regulatory agency transferring operatorship of such
assets to Purchaser.

 



 

 **Section 7.5** **_Public Announcements_**. Until the Closing, neither
Sellers nor Purchaser shall make any press release or other public
announcement regarding the existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
others; provided, however, the foregoing shall not restrict disclosures by
Purchaser or Sellers which are required by applicable securities or other Laws
or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the
disclosing party or its Affiliates. At or after Closing, the content of any
press release or public announcement first announcing the consummation of this
transaction shall be subject to the prior review and reasonable approval of
Sellers and Purchaser; provided, however, the foregoing shall not restrict
disclosures by Purchaser or Sellers which are required by applicable
securities or other Laws or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having
jurisdiction over the disclosing party or its Affiliates.

 



 

 **Section 7.6** **_Operation of Business_**.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth on **_Schedule 7.6_** and solely with regard to the
period commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing until the

business with respect to the ownership of the Combined Assets in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices and in compliance with the
terms of all applicable Laws and the terms of the Leases and the Company
Leases, (ii) upon any of Sellers or any of their Affiliates obtaining

Lease, Company Lease, Company Surface Contract, Surface Contract, tort claim,

each case, relates to the Combined Assets or any of the Companies, in each
case, only to the extent would exceed $250,000, (iii) not settle any

affecting the period after the Effective Time to the extent such settlement
results in the assumption of any damages or liabilities by Purchaser or any
Company as of the Effective Time, (iv) not propose any individual AFE or
similar request with respect to the Combined Assets or the Companies that is
reasonably expected to result in expenditures in excess of $250,000.00 (net to
Sellers and Companies collective interest in the Combined Assets), (v)
maintain insurance coverage on the Combined Assets presently furnished by
nonaffiliated Third Parties in the amounts and of the types presently in
force, (vi) not transfer, farmout, sell, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise
dispose of any Combined Assets or the Interests, except for sales and

consistent with past practices, (vii) with respect to the Companies or with
respect to Asset Taxes relating to the Combined Assets: (A) not make or change

with respect to Taxes, in each case to the extent such action would adversely
affect the Combined Assets (viii) will use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain in force and effect all Leases (in their condition as of the date of
this Agreement), provided that "commercially reasonable efforts" for purposes
of this **Section 7.6(a)(viii)** shall not include any obligation to drill any
wells or pay any amounts to any lessor or third party (other than amounts for
royalties and other burdens on production or shut-in payments due and payable
under the terms of any Lease or Company Lease), (ix) maintain all material
governmental permits affecting the Combined Assets in the their condition as
of the date of this Agreement, (x) not (A) enter into any Contract or Company

of the date of the execution of this Agreement or (B) terminate, amend or
extend any Material Contract, and (xi) not commit to do any of the matters set
forth in clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (x) above. Purchasers approval of

within ten (10) days of (unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the
circumstances and such shorter time is specified in Sellers written notice)
Purchasers receipt of any Sellers written notice to Purchaser requesting
such consent unless Purchaser notifies Sellers to the contrary in writing
during that period. In the event of an emergency, Sellers may take such action
as a prudent operator would take and shall notify Purchaser of such action
promptly thereafter.

 



 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers or the Companies may own an undivided
interest in certain of the Combined Assets, and Purchaser agrees that the acts
or omissions of the other working interest owners shall not constitute a
violation of the provisions of this **Section 7.6** nor shall any action
required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a violation so
long as Sellers have voted their interest in a manner consistent with the
provisions of this **Section 7.6**.

 



 

(c) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, during the period from
the date hereof to the Closing, Sellers shall cause each Company to conduct
its operations according to its ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and shall use reasonable efforts to preserve, maintain, and
protect its assets, rights, relationships, and properties; provided, however,
neither Sellers nor the Companies shall be required to make any payments,
drill any wells, pay any amounts, or enter into or amend any contracts,
agreements, arrangements, or understandings to satisfy the foregoing
obligation other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice. During such period, Sellers may terminate any intercompany financial
arrangement between either or both of the Companies, on the one hand, and
Sellers or their Affiliates on the other hand.

 



 

(d) Without limitation of **Section 7.6(c)** , Sellers shall not, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser:

 



 

(i) permit either Company to amend its certificate of formation or limited
liability company agreement;

 



 

(ii) permit either Company to (A) issue, sell, or deliver any membership
interests or other securities or equity equivalents; or (B) amend in any
material respect any of the terms of any such interests outstanding as of the
date hereof;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) permit either Company to, except to the extent the same will be

or assume any indebtedness for borrowed money or otherwise become liable or
responsible for the obligations of any other Person; (B) make any loans,
advances, or capital contributions to, or investments in, any other Person; or
(C) mortgage or pledge any of its material assets, tangible or intangible;

 



 

(iv) permit either Company to acquire (by merger, consolidation, or
acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise) any corporation, partnership, or
other business organization or division thereof; or

 



 

(v) permit either Company to acquire, sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any assets; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall restrict a Company from (A) distributing cash, or (B)
conveying assets and properties to be excluded from the transactions covered
by this Agreement, including any Company Excluded Assets, or Company Assets
excluded under **Article 3** or **Article 4** or as provided for in **Section
7.9**.

 



 

(vi) permit or cause a Company to: (A) increase or agree to increase the
compensation payable or to become payable by any Company to any of its

 **Section 7.7** **_Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements_**.

 



 

(a) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are expressly subject to
all validly existing and applicable Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements, Soft Consents and other required consents and approvals to
transfer the Assets. Within 5 Business Days from the date of this Agreement,
Sellers shall initiate all procedures (including mailing all notices, and
requests for consent) which are reasonably required to comply with or obtain
the waiver of all Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements set forth in
**_Schedule 5.13_** and all Soft Consents with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all such consents and to obtain waivers of applicable
Preference Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , Sellers shall not be obligated to
pay any out-of-pocket consideration to (or incur any out-of-pocket cost or
expense for the benefit of) the holder of any Preference Right, Transfer
Requirement or Soft Consent in order to obtain the waiver thereof or
compliance therewith; and provided further that any Soft Consent as to which
the lessor, or other holder of

 



      
 

 



 

such Soft Consent, has not objected to the transfer or affirmatively stated in
writing that consent thereto will not be forthcoming, shall be deemed waived
and otherwise satisfied twenty (20) days after a Seller makes written request
to said lessor, or other holder of such Soft Consent, for consent to transfer
the affected Asset(s) to Purchaser; _provided_ , further, however, that to the
extent any Soft Consent is not obtained or waived prior to Closing, Purchaser
agrees to assume and close over such unobtained Soft Consents without
adjustment to the Purchase Price, and Purchaser shall assume all risk and
liability relating thereto.

 



 

(b) If the holder of a Preference Right elects prior to Closing to purchase
the Asset subject to a Preference Right (a "Preference Property") in
accordance with the terms of such Preference Right, and Sellers receive
written notice of such election prior to the Closing, such Preference Property
will be eliminated from the Combined Assets and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of the Preference Property.

 



 

(c) If

 



 

(i) a third party brings any suit, action or other proceeding prior to the
Closing seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce a
Preference Right;

 



 

(ii) a Combined Asset is subject to a Transfer Requirement that is not a Soft
Consent and such Transfer Requirement is not waived, complied with or
otherwise satisfied prior to the Closing Date; or

 



 

(iii) the holder of a Preference Right does not elect to purchase such
Preference Property or waive such Preference Right with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date and the
time in which the Preference Right may be exercised has not expired;

 



 

then, unless otherwise agreed by Sellers and Purchaser, the Combined Asset or
portion thereof affected by such Preference Right or Transfer Requirement (a
"Retained Asset") shall be held back from the Combined Assets to be
transferred and conveyed (directly or indirectly) to Purchaser at Closing and
the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such Retained Asset pursuant to **Section 7.7(b)**. Any Retained
Asset so held back at the initial Closing will be conveyed to Purchaser at a
delayed Closing (which shall become the new Closing Date with respect to such
Retained Asset), within ten (10) days following the date on which the suit,
action or other proceeding, if any, referenced in clause (i) above is settled
or a judgment is rendered (and no longer subject to appeal) permitting
transfer of the Retained Asset to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and
Sellers comply with or obtain a waiver of or notice of election not to
exercise, or otherwise satisfies, all remaining Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements with respect to such Retained Asset as contemplated by this
**Section 7.7(c)** (or if multiple Combined Assets are Retained Assets, on a
date mutually agreed to by the parties in order to consolidate, to the extent
reasonably possible, the number of Closings). At the delayed Closing,
Purchaser shall pay Sellers a purchase price equal to the amount by which the
Purchase Price was reduced on account of the holding back of such Retained
Asset (as adjusted pursuant to **Section 2.2** through the new Closing Date
therefor); _provided_ , _however_ , if all such Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements with respect to any Retained Asset so held

 



      
 

 



 

back at the initial Closing are not obtained, complied with, waived or
otherwise satisfied as contemplated by this Section within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the initial Closing has occurred with respect to any Asset,
then such Retained Asset shall be eliminated from the Assets and shall become
an Excluded Asset, unless Sellers and Purchaser agree to proceed with a
closing on such Retained Asset, in which case Purchaser shall be deemed to
have waived any objection (and shall be obligated to indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Persons for all Losses) with respect to non-compliance with such
Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements with respect to such Retained
Asset(s).

 



 

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers desire to sell all of the Assets to
Purchaser and would not have entered into this Agreement but for Purchasers
agreement to purchase all of the Assets as herein provided. Accordingly, it is
expressly understood and agreed that Sellers do not desire to sell any
Property affected by a Preference Right to Purchaser unless the sale of all of
the Assets is consummated by the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Sellers obligation hereunder
to sell the Preference Properties to Purchaser is expressly conditioned upon
the consummation by the Closing Date of the sale of all of the Assets (other
than Retained Assets or other Assets excluded pursuant to the express
provisions of this Agreement) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
either by conveyance to Purchaser or conveyance pursuant to an applicable
Preference Right; provided that, nothing herein is intended or shall operate
to extend or apply any Preference Right to any portion of the Assets which is
not otherwise burdened thereby. Time is of the essence with respect to the
parties agreement to consummate the sale of the Assets by the Closing Date
(or by the delayed Closing Date pursuant to **Section 7.7(c)** ).

 



 

 **Section 7.8** **_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Sellers shall be responsible for all Asset Taxes that are attributable to
any period of time at or prior to Effective Time. Purchaser shall be
responsible for all Asset Taxes that are attributable to any period of time
after the Effective Time. For the purposes of determining such allocations,
Asset Taxes shall be allocated in accordance with **Section 1.4(b)(ii)**. For
purposes of this **Section 7.8(a)** , ad valorem and real property Taxes
assessed for a particular time period shall be deemed "attributable" to such
time period, even if such assessment is valued based upon production or other
data for prior Tax periods. Regardless of which Party is responsible, Sellers
shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Body of all Asset Taxes
affecting the ownership or operation of the Combined Assets which are required
to be paid prior to Closing (and shall file all Tax Returns with respect to
such Asset Taxes), and Purchaser shall handle payment to the appropriate
Governmental Body of all Asset Taxes affecting the ownership or operation of
the Combined Assets which are required to be paid after Closing (and shall
file all Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes). To the extent the actual
amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the time an adjustment to the Purchase
Price is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant to **Section 2.2**
or **Section 9.4** , as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the most recent
information available in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax for purposes
of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax (or the
amount thereof paid or economically borne by a Party) is ultimately determined
to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken into account in the
Final Settlement Statement as finally determined pursuant to **Section 9.4** ,
timely payments will be made from one Party to the other to the extent
necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax that is
allocable to such Party under the

 



      
 

 



 

provisions of **Section 1.4(b)(ii)**. If requested by Purchaser, Sellers will
assist Purchaser with preparation of all Asset Tax Returns due on or before
thirty (30) days after Closing (including any extensions requested). Sellers
shall deliver to Purchaser within thirty (30) days of filing copies of all Tax
Returns filed by Sellers after the Closing Date affecting the Assets and any
supporting documentation provided by Sellers to Governmental Bodies.

 



 

(b) Income or franchise Taxes assessed against the Companies, if any, shall be
apportioned between the Parties as of the Closing Date with (a) the Sellers
being obligated to pay the amount that would be payable if the Tax period of
such Company ended on (and included) the Closing Date, and (b) Purchaser being
obligated to pay the remainder; provided, that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated between
the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the period beginning
after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period.
Except as expressly provided in this **Section 7.8(b)** , each Party shall
retain liability for, and shall be solely responsible for, any and all
assessments against it for U.S. federal and state income Taxes and franchise
Taxes. The Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of
each Company (other than Asset Tax Returns described in **Section 7.8(a)** )
that solely relate to period ending on or before the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Taxes Returns of each Company with
respect to any Tax Period beginning on and ending after the Closing Date. In
the event any Party makes any payment (directly or indirectly) for Taxes that
are allocable to the other Party under this **Section 7.8(b)** , each Party
shall reimburse each other Party in an amount necessary to cause each Party to
bear their share of Taxes as allocated under this **Section 7.8(b)** promptly
but in no event later than ten (10) days after the presentation of a statement
setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the presenting Party is
entitled along with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the amount of the reimbursement.

 



 

(c) Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent able and
as reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of
any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other Proceeding and making
employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. To
the extent applicable, Purchaser and Sellers agree (i) to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Sellers,
any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Body, and (ii)
to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, each party shall allow the other party the option of taking
possession of such books and records prior to their disposal. Purchaser and
Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

(d) Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing upon receipt by any
Seller of notice of any pending or threatened Asset Tax audits or assessments
relating to the income,

 



      
 

 



 

properties or operations of any Seller that reasonably may be expected to
relate to or give rise to a lien on the Combined Assets. Each of Purchaser and
Sellers shall promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt of notice of
any pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment challenging the Allocation.

 



 

(e) Any payments made to any party pursuant to **Article 11** shall constitute
an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as
such by Purchaser and Sellers on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by
law.

 



 

(f) Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection of accommodating a 1031
exchange (as provided for under Section 1031 of the Code). Each of Purchaser
and Sellers reserve the right, at or prior to Closing, to assign its rights
under this Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the Purchase Price,
and that portion of the Assets associated therewith ("1031 Assets"), to a
"Qualified Intermediary" (as that term is defined in Section
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v) of the Treasury Regulations) to accomplish this
transaction, in whole or in part, in a manner that will comply with the
requirements of a like-kind exchange ("Like-Kind Exchange") pursuant to
Section 1031 of the Code. In order to effect a Like-Kind Exchange, the non-
electing party shall cooperate and do all acts as may be reasonably required
or requested by the party electing for a Like-Kind Exchange with regard to
effecting such Like-Kind Exchange, including, but not limited to, executing
additional escrow instructions, documents, agreements or instruments to effect
an exchange; provided, however, that neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall be
required to take title to any property other than the Assets in connection
with the Like-Kind Exchange, and Closing will not be delayed by reason of any
such Like-Kind Exchange. Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge and agree that a
whole or partial assignment of this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary
shall not release the other party from any of its respective promises,
liabilities and obligations to the other party or expand any promises,
liabilities or obligations of such party under this Agreement. Neither party
represents to the other that any particular tax treatment will be given to
either party as a result of the Like-Kind Exchange. Neither party shall be
obligated to pay any additional costs or incur any additional obligations in
its sale of the Assets if such costs are the result of the other partys Like-
Kind Exchange, and each party shall hold harmless and indemnify the other
party from and against all claims, losses and liabilities (including
reasonable attorneys fees, court costs and related expenses), if any,
resulting from such a Like-Kind Exchange.

 



 

 **Section 7.9** **_Further Assurances_**. After the Closing, Sellers and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their Affiliates, as applicable to, execute,
acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances, transfer orders,
division orders, notices assumptions, releases and acquittances, and such
other instruments, and shall take such further actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to assure fully to Purchaser or Sellers (including their
successors and assigns) as the case may be, that the transactions described in
this Agreement shall be completed and that all of the Assets intended to be
conveyed under the terms of this Agreement are so conveyed, including such
Assets that are improperly described herein or inadvertently omitted from this
Agreement and/or the Conveyance (including the Exhibits attached to each) and
to assure fully that Purchaser has assumed the liabilities and obligations
intended to be assumed by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 7.10** **_Assignment of Excluded Company Assets_**. Prior to
Closing, the Companies shall execute and deliver an assignment to Sellers of
the Company Excluded Assets, as well as any other Company Assets excluded from
the transactions contemplated hereunder, which assignment shall be in the form
attached hereto as **Exhibit E** without any warranty or liability of any
kind. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
any Combined Assets which are assigned to Sellers pursuant to this **Section
7.10** and are conveyed to Purchaser at a delayed Closing pursuant to
**Section 3.4(d)(iii)** shall, immediately upon such assignment to Purchaser,
cease to be "Company Excluded Assets" for purposes of **Article 11**.

 



 

 **Section 7.11** **_Interim Hedging Activities_**.

 



 

(a) On or prior to the 10th Business Day after the execution date of this
Agreement, Purchaser may deliver a written notice to Guarantor (for purposes
of this Section, the "Seller Hedging Party") specifying any volumes Purchaser
would like to be hedged pursuant to the hedging transactions generally
described on **_Schedule 7.11_** and not exceeding the aggregate volumes set
forth on **_Schedule 7.11_** (collectively, the " **Hedging Transactions** ")
for Purchaser with a Counterparty, and upon receipt of any such notice on a
Business Day during normal business hours, Seller Hedging Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly enter into the requested Hedging
Transactions, provided that Seller Hedging Party does not have to enter into
any such Hedging Transaction unless the applicable Counterparty or
Counterparties identified in such request (i) agree to the Hedging Transaction
requested by Purchaser, (ii) each of the Counterparties in the documents
evidencing any such Hedging Transaction will permit the assignment by Seller
Hedging Party to Purchaser (and/or Purchasers designee) at the Closing of all
of the trades that are the subject of any such Hedging Transaction.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, Seller Hedging Party shall assign to Purchaser (or
Purchasers designee) all of the trades that are the subject of the Hedging
Transactions entered into by Seller Hedging Party for Purchaser (or
Purchasers designee) pursuant to this **Section 7.11** and Purchaser (or such
Purchasers designee) shall accept such assignment from Seller Hedging Party
and assume all obligations and liabilities attributable thereto pursuant to
all documentation required by the applicable Counterparties.

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) **Section
10.1(c)** , (ii) **Section 10.1(b)(i)** because the conditions set forth in
**Section 8.1(e)** or **Section 8.2(e)** are not satisfied, or (iii) except to
the extent any such termination is as of a result of a Stockholder Proceeding,
**Section 10.1(b)(ii)** , then within ten (10) Business Days following the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with **Article 10** by Sellers,
Seller Hedging Party shall unwind all Hedging Transactions with each
Counterparty and the Purchaser shall be obligated for, and shall promptly pay
to Seller Hedging Party, all Hedging Losses, if any, resulting from or
attributable to the Hedging Transactions for which Seller Hedging Party
entered into for Purchaser and the unwind thereof.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Hedging
Transactions and the underlying contracts and the actions to be taken by
Seller Hedging Party in accordance with this **Section 7.11** are an exception
to, and will under no circumstance constitute a breach of any of (i) the
representations and warranties made by Sellers in **Section 5.10** and (ii)
Sellers covenants contained in **Section 7.6**.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 7.12** **_Debt Financing_**.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement, Sellers and their Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide commercially reasonable cooperation
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (or any permitted
replacement, amended, modified or any Alternate Financing) as may be
reasonably requested in writing by Purchaser or its representatives (provided,
that such requested cooperation is customary in connection with the
arrangement of debt financing for transactions that are substantially similar
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business of
Sellers or their Affiliates), including delivering and furnishing, as promptly
as reasonably practicable, such financial and other information as Purchaser
shall reasonably request in writing regarding the Assets and/or the Companies
that is required to be provided by Purchaser in order to consummate the Debt
Financing, including lease, well and production records and financial
statements, it being understood and agreed that all materials and information
obtained by Purchaser pursuant hereto may be shared with the Debt Financing
Sources; provided that (A) this **Section 7.12** shall not require travel by
any of the subject Persons in order to comply with the terms hereof, (B)
Purchaser shall reimburse all out of pocket expenses incurred by Sellers or
any of their Affiliates or representatives in complying with this **Section
7.12,** (C) neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates or representatives
make any representations or warranties, express or implied, in connection with
the information provided hereunder, including with respect to the accuracy or
completeness of the information, (D) Purchaser will make reasonable efforts to
minimize any disruption associated with the cooperation contemplated by such
Persons hereby, and (E) Sellers shall not be obligated to spend any out-of-
pocket sums or amounts in connection with its cooperation under this Section.
Notwithstanding anything stated in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers
shall not have any liability to Purchaser with regard to assistance, lack of
assistance, information or data provided in connection with this **Section
7.12** and no action or inaction by Sellers under this **Section 7.12** shall
permit or allow Purchaser to terminate this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep Sellers
reasonably informed with respect to material activity concerning the status of
the Debt Financing contemplated by any Debt Commitment Letter. Without
limiting the foregoing, Purchaser agrees to notify Sellers promptly after any
of its officers obtaining actual knowledge thereof, if at any time (i) any
Debt Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason or (ii)
any Debt Financing Source that is a party to its Debt Commitment Letter
notifies Purchaser in writing that such Debt Financing Source no longer
intends to provide financing to Purchaser on the terms set forth therein, or
(iii) for any reason Purchaser no longer believes in good faith that it will
be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by any
Debt Commitment Letter on the terms described therein, in each case to the
extent such event would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent (or result
in the delay or prevention of) the Closing.

 



 

 **Section 7.13** **_Financial Records and Access to Information_** **. **For
a period following the Closing Date until the third anniversary of the Closing
Date, Sellers shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to), in a manner
consistent with its past practice with respect to the preparation of financial
information:

 



       
 

 



 

(a) make all financial records and all financial information related to the
Assets and the Companies (the "Financial Records") for the period prior to the
Closing Date that is necessary for Purchaser to prepare and obtain the audit
of any financial statements relating to the Assets and the Companies to the
extent required to be filed (such filings, the "Filings") by Purchaser or its
Affiliates with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder available to
Purchaser and its representatives at Sellers offices;

 



 

(b) shall provide Purchaser with reasonable access, at reasonable times and
upon prior notice, and at no cost to Sellers, to the employees of Sellers or
their Affiliates associated with the preparation of those Financial Records
for purposes of performing Purchasers audits and financial filings required
by a Governmental Body;

 



 

(c) provide reasonable cooperation to the independent auditors chosen by
Purchaser ("Purchasers Auditor") in connection with any audit by Purchasers
Auditor of any financial statements of Seller or its Affiliates with respect
to the Assets and the Companies that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
requires to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act or Exchange Act
with respect to any Filings; and

 



 

(d) retain all relevant information and documents in its possession that would
reasonably be expected to be necessary in connection with the preparation and
audit of financial statements with respect to the Assets and the Companies as
provided in this **Section 7.13**.

 



 

Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, Sellers shall have no
obligation to provide any financial statements that are not required by the
SEC, and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the
periods and dates presented of financial statements and other information to
be included in such financial statements that would otherwise be required by
the SEC, including, by promptly seeking waivers, exemptions or advice from the
staff of the SEC.

 



 

 **Section 7.14** **_Available Employees_**. Within five (5) Business Days
after the execution of this Agreement, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser a
schedule with respect to each of the Available Employees that includes the
following data: name, job title, salary or wage, bonus eligibility / target,
long term incentive eligibility / target, whether such employee is on a leave
of absence, current location, and start date. Sellers and their Affiliates
shall make the Available Employees reasonably available to Purchaser in order
for Purchaser to conduct interviews and make decisions regarding offers of
employment with respect to the Available Employees. Purchaser will notify
Sellers as to which of the Available Employees it intends to make offers of
employment to at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing and
shall within two (2) Business Days thereafter make such offers to such
Available Employees; provided that any such employment of an Available
Employee who accepts an employment offer by Purchaser shall not commence until
the Termination Date (as such term is defined in the Transition Service
Agreement). Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers in writing as to the
identities of such Available Employees who have accepted offers of employment
from Purchaser or its Affiliates and Sellers and their Affiliates shall
terminate the employment of such Available Employees effective as of the
Termination Date (as such term is defined in the Transition Service
Agreement). Nothing herein, expressed or implied, shall confer upon any
Available Employees

 



      
 

 



 

(or any of their beneficiaries or alternate payees) any rights or remedies
(including any right to employment or continued employment, or any right to
compensation or benefits for any period) of any nature or kind whatsoever,
under or by reason of this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

 **Section 7.15** **_Preparation of the Information Statement_**.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement and in lieu of calling a
meeting of Guarantors stockholders, Guarantor shall submit a form of
irrevocable written consent attached hereto as **Exhibit H** to record holders
of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Guarantors common stock
seeking the Stockholder Consent. In connection with seeking the Stockholder
Consent, Guarantor shall take all actions necessary to comply, and shall
comply in all respects, with the General Corporate Law of the State of
Delaware, including Section 228 and Section 271 thereof, and Guarantors
Charter Documents.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in
any event within 15 Business Days after the date of this Agreement), Guarantor
shall prepare and file with the SEC a written information statement of the
type contemplated by Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act containing the information
specified in Schedule 14C under the Exchange Act concerning its seeking the
Stockholder Consent (the "Information Statement"). Purchaser shall furnish all
information concerning it to Guarantor as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Information
Statement. Guarantor shall promptly notify Purchaser upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Information Statement and shall provide
Purchaser with copies of all correspondence between it and its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Guarantor
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Information
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the
Information Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Guarantor (i) shall provide
Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments
reasonably proposed by Purchaser. If, at any time prior to the date that is 20
days after the Information Statement is first mailed to Guarantors
stockholders, any information relating to Sellers, Guarantor, Purchaser or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
Guarantor or Purchaser which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Information Statement, so that the Information Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Guarantor.

 



 

(c) Guarantor agrees that the Information Statement will comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and that none
of the information included or incorporated by reference in the Information
Statement will, at the date the Information Statement is filed with the SEC or
mailed to the stockholders of Guarantor, or at the time of any amendment or
supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

 



      
 

 



 

omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, except that no covenant is made by
Guarantor with respect to statements made in the Information Statement based
on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Purchaser specifically
for inclusion or incorporation for reference therein. Purchaser agrees that
none of such information provided by or on behalf of Purchaser will, at the
date the Information Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the
stockholders of Guarantor, or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

 



 

(d) Guarantor shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Information
Statement to be (i) filed with the SEC in definitive form as contemplated by
Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act and (ii) mailed to the stockholders of
Guarantor, in each case as promptly as practicable after, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days after, the latest of (A) confirmation from the
SEC that it has no further comments on the Information Statement, (B)
confirmation from the SEC that the Information Statement is otherwise not to
be reviewed or (C) expiration of the 10-day period after filing in the event
the SEC does not review the Information Statement.

 



 

 **Section 7.16** **_Indenture Matters_** **.**

 



 

(a) Guarantor shall, and shall cause the guarantors under the Indenture (the
"Notes Guarantors") to, commence on or after the date hereof and consummate on
or prior to the date that is ten (10) Business Days after the execution of
this Agreement (the "Indenture Consent Date") a consent solicitation (the
"Consent Solicitation") pursuant to which a supplemental indenture is sought
to be approved, executed and delivered, which supplemental indenture would
amend the Indenture and the Notes to modify, delete or waive the change of
control covenants, the merger covenants, and any other provision in the
Indenture or the Notes that could be breached by the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or that would require Purchaser or any Company to assume or
become liable for or in respect of any of the Notes or any other obligations
in connection with the Indenture in such a way as to prevent any such breach,
assumption or liability (collectively, the "Target Provisions").

 



 

(b) Guarantors obligation to make any payment with respect to the Consent
Solicitation may be subject to one or more conditions reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, including the contemporaneous consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Consent Solicitation shall be conducted in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture and all applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC and other applicable Laws.

 



 

(c) Guarantor shall, and shall cause the Notes Guarantors to, waive any of the
conditions to the Consent Solicitation as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser (other than the condition that payment with respect to the Consent
Solicitation be conditioned on the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and that there shall be no Law prohibiting consummation of
the Consent Solicitation), if such waivers would not cause the Consent
Solicitation to violate the Indenture, the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, as amended, or any other applicable Law. Without the prior
consent of Purchaser, Guarantor shall not, and shall not permit any Notes
Guarantor to, waive any condition to the Consent

 



      
 

 



 

Solicitation or make any change, amendment or modification to the terms and
conditions of the Consent Solicitation (including any extension thereof),
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or as otherwise required to
comply with applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Guarantor shall, until the Consent Solicitation has been consummated and
the supplemental indenture with respect thereto has been executed and has
become effective, prepare, in consultation with Purchaser, as promptly as
practicable, all agreements, documents, instruments and other writings
necessary or advisable in respect thereof, including a consent solicitation
statement, a form of supplemental indenture, officers certificates and legal
opinions (collectively, the "Indenture Documents").

 



 

 **Section 7.17** **_Non-Solicitation_**

 



 

(a) Guarantor, Sellers and the Companies agree that they shall, and that they
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to a Competing Proposal or a proposal
or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal
and, until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to **Section 10.1** , not, directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any
inquiry or proposal with respect to the making of a Competing Proposal or a
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal;
(ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
nonpublic information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with
any Person with respect to, any Competing Proposal or any proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal; (iii) engage in
discussions with any Person with respect to any Competing Proposal or any
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal;
(iv) approve or recommend (or publicly propose to approve or recommend) any
Competing Proposal; or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document
or any agreement or commitment providing for any Competing Proposal or
requiring any of Guarantor, any of Sellers or any of the Companies to
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Guarantor, Sellers and the Companies shall promptly after the date
hereof (x) revoke or withdraw access of any Person other than Purchaser and
its Representatives to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any non-
public information with respect to Guarantor, Sellers and the Companies
previously furnished with respect to a Competing Proposal and (y) instruct
each Person, other than Purchaser and its Representatives, that has executed a
confidentiality agreement relating to a Competing Proposal with or for the
benefit of any of Guarantor, any of Sellers or any of the Companies promptly
to return to Guarantor, Sellers and/or the Companies or destroy all
information, documents, and materials relating to the Competing Proposal or to
Guarantor, Sellers and/or the Companies or their businesses, operations or
affairs heretofore furnished by any of Guarantor, any of Sellers and/or any of
the Companies or any of their respective Representatives to such Person or any
of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality
agreement with such Person.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in **Section 7.17(a)** , if
after the date hereof and at any time prior to August 11, 2017, any of
Guarantor, any of Sellers or any of the Companies receive a bona fide written
Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of this **Section 7.17**
and the board of directors of Guarantor determines in good faith after

 



      
 

 



 

consultation with Guarantors outside legal and financial advisors (i) that
such Competing Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result
in, after the taking of any of the actions referred to in either of clause (x)
or (y) below, a Superior Proposal and (ii) failure to take any action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Guarantor
to the stockholders of Guarantor under applicable Law, Guarantor, Sellers or
the Companies may take the following actions: (x) furnish information to the
Third Party making such Competing Proposal (provided, that substantially
concurrently Guarantor, Sellers or the Companies makes available such
information to Purchaser to the extent such information was not previously
made available to Purchaser) and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations
with the Third Party with respect to the Competing Proposal (and enter into a
confidentiality agreement in connection therewith); provided, however, that
Guarantor shall provide at least 24 hours written notice to Purchaser of such
determination of the board of directors of Guarantor pursuant to clauses (i)
and (ii) above and the taking of such actions as described in clauses (x) and
(y) above. From and after the execution of this Agreement, Guarantor, Sellers
and the Companies shall promptly notify (and in any event, within 24 hours)
Purchaser of the receipt of any Competing Proposal, and (A) if it is in
writing, deliver to Purchaser a copy of such Competing Proposal and any
related draft agreements and other written material setting forth the terms
and conditions of such Competing Proposal and the identity of the Person
making such Competing Proposal or (B) if oral, provide to Purchaser a summary
of the material terms and conditions thereof including the identity of the
Person making such Competing Proposal. Guarantor, Sellers and the Companies
shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of the
status and material details of any such Competing Proposal and with respect to
any material change to the terms of any such Competing Proposal.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in **Section 7.17(b)** , neither the board of
directors of Guarantor nor any committee thereof may (i) approve, adopt,
endorse, or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, adopt, endorse or
recommend) any Competing Proposal (it being understood that the Guarantor may
make any factually accurate public statement that solely describes
Guarantors, Sellers or the Companies receipt of a Competing Proposal and
the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto or any "stop, look and
listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) or (ii) except as expressly contemplated
by **Section 7.17(b)** , cause or permit Guarantor, Sellers and/or the
Companies to enter into any contract, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, or agreement in principle regarding or providing for any
Competing Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement).

 



 

(d) Nothing in this **Section 7.17** shall be deemed to prohibit Guarantor
from complying with Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or to prohibit Guarantor from making any
disclosure if the board of directors of Guarantor determines in good faith
after consultation with Guarantors outside legal advisors that the failure to
do so would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, nor shall any such
action be deemed to constitute a breach of Sellers and/or the Companies
obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if at any time prior to August 11, 2017, Guarantor, Sellers and/or the
Companies receives a Competing Proposal and the board of directors of
Guarantor determines in good faith, after

 



      
 

 



 

consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, that such
Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and failure to take any
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board of
directors of Guarantor to the stockholders of Guarantor under applicable Law,
then the board of directors of Guarantor may cause Guarantor, Sellers and the
Companies to terminate this Agreement and enter into a binding written
agreement (a "Superior Proposal Agreement") with respect to such Superior
Proposal pursuant to **Section 10.1(e)** ; provided, however, that such
termination shall only be effective if: (i) (x) Guarantor, Sellers and/or the
Companies shall have complied with this **Section 7.17** in all material
respects and (y) Guarantor, Sellers and the Companies shall have provided
written notice to Purchaser of Sellers and the Companies intention to
terminate this Agreement, which notice shall include the terms of the Superior
Proposal, including the final draft of the Superior Proposal Agreement and the
identity of the Person making such Competing Proposal (the "Termination Intent
Notice"); (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period immediately following
Guarantors, Sellers and the Companies delivery to Purchaser of the
Termination Intent Notice (the "Negotiation Period"), (x) Guarantor, Sellers
and the Companies shall have, if requested by Purchaser, negotiated in good
faith with respect to any proposals for amendments to this Agreement made by
Purchaser and (y) Guarantor, Sellers and the Companies shall keep Purchaser
reasonably informed with respect to the status and changes in the material
terms and conditions of such Competing Proposal or other changes in
circumstances related thereto; provided, however, that any material revisions
to such Competing Proposal (it being agreed that any change in the purchase
price in such Competing Proposal shall be deemed a material revision) shall
require delivery of a subsequent Termination Intent Notice and a subsequent
Negotiation Period in respect of such revised Competing Proposal, except that
such subsequent Negotiation Period shall expire two (2) Business Days
immediately following the delivery to Purchaser of the subsequent Termination
Intent Notice; (iii) within one (1) Business Day following the expiration of
the Negotiation Period, the board of directors of Guarantor has determined in
good faith, after consultation with Guarantors outside legal and financial
advisors, taking into account all amendments or revisions to this Agreement
proposed by Purchaser, that (x) the Competing Proposal remains a Superior
Proposal and (y) the failure to enter into the Competing Proposal would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Guarantor
to the stockholders of Guarantor under applicable Law; (iv) the Sellers have
paid the Termination Fee to Purchaser upon the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and (v) Guarantor, Sellers
and/or the Companies enter into such Superior Proposal Agreement substantially
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) As used in this Agreement, "Competing Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
proposal from a Third Party for (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, issuance of securities, direct or indirect acquisition
of securities, recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar
transaction in which (x) a Person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act
and the rules promulgated thereunder) of Persons directly or indirectly
acquires, or if consummated in accordance with its terms would acquire,
beneficial or record ownership of securities representing more than 20% of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of Guarantor; or (y)
Guarantor issues securities representing more than 20% of the outstanding
shares of any class of voting securities of Guarantor; (ii) any direct or
indirect sale, lease, exchange, transfer, acquisition or disposition of any
assets of Guarantor, Sellers, the Companies or any subsidiaries thereof that
constitute or account for (x) more than 20% of the consolidated net revenues
of Guarantor, consolidated net income of Guarantor or consolidated

 



      
 

 



 

book value of Guarantor; or (y) more than 20% of the fair market value of the
assets of Guarantor or (iii) any liquidation or dissolution of Guarantor.

 



 

(g) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean a Competing
Proposal made after the date hereof (with all percentages in clause (i) and
clause (ii) of the definition of Competing Proposal increased to fifty percent
(50%)) that did not result from a material breach of **Section 7.17(a)** or
**(b)** , and that is or, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors
of Guarantor, is reasonably capable of being fully financed, on terms that the
board of directors of Guarantor determines in good faith, after consultation
with Guarantors outside financial and legal advisors, would be more favorable
to Guarantor and its stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, after taking into account any
proposal by Purchaser in writing to amend or modify the terms hereof and all
factors the board of directors of Guarantor acting in good faith considers to
be appropriate.

Accounting Firm may not award damages or penalties to either party. Any
decision rendered by the Agreed Accounting Firm pursuant hereto shall be
final, conclusive and binding on Sellers and Purchaser and will be enforceable

Purchase Price, as applicable.

 



 

(c) All payments made or to be made hereunder to Sellers shall be by
electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the account of Sellers

pursuant to **Section 10.1(h), **then Purchaser shall be entitled to the
Deposit (and the parties shall provide written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to deliver the Deposit to Purchaser) and Sellers shall pay Purchaser,
simultaneous with or prior to such termination, the Termination Fee, which
shall be Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy for all losses and damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise (which Termination Fee shall be deemed liquidated damages, and not a
penalty, for such termination and the parties hereby agree that the foregoing
described liquidated damages are reasonable considering all of the
circumstances existing as of the date of this Agreement and constitute the
parties good faith estimate of the actual damages reasonably expected to
result from such termination of this Agreement by Sellers) and upon payment of

liability or obligation related to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. If either party is entitled to and a party

The indemnities set forth in in **Section 11.3(d), 11.3(e), 11.3(f)** and
**Section 11.3(h) **shall terminate three (3) years after Closing. Upon the
termination of a covenant or agreement (including any indemnity) in accordance
with the foregoing, such covenant or agreement (including any indemnity
therefor) shall have no further force or effect for any purpose under this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) No party hereto shall have any indemnification obligation pursuant to this
**Article 11** or otherwise in respect of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement unless it shall have received from the party seeking
indemnification a written notice (a "Claim Notice") of the existence of the
claim for or in respect of which indemnification in respect of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is being sought on or before
the expiration of

 



      
 

 



 

the applicable survival period set forth in **Section 11.2(a)**. If an
Indemnified Party delivers a Claim Notice to an Indemnifying Party before the
expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in **Section
11.2(a)**, then the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter
covered by such Claim Notice. A Claim Notice shall set forth with reasonable
specificity (1) the basis for such claim under this Agreement, and the facts
that otherwise form the basis of such claim and (2) to the extent reasonably
estimable, an estimate of the amount of such claim (which estimate shall not
be conclusive of the final amount of such claim) and an explanation of the
calculation of such estimate.

 



 

(c) Sellers shall not have any liability for any indemnification or for any
Losses under **Section 11.3(a) **(other than for breach of Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties in **Section 5.8**),
until and unless (i) the amount of the liability for any individual claim or
series of claims arising out of the same or similar set of facts, for which a
Claim Notice is delivered by Purchaser exceeds $150,000, ("Individual
Indemnity Threshold") and (ii) the aggregate amount of the liabilities for all
claims and Losses for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser exceeds
two percent (2.0%) of the Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such
damages or Losses exceed two percent (2.0%) of the Purchase Price (the
"Aggregate Indemnity Deductible"); and further, for the avoidance of doubt,
claims for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser which do not meet
the Individual Indemnity Threshold shall not be included in reaching the
Aggregate Indemnity Deductible.

 



 

(d) Sellers shall never be required to indemnify Purchaser, or otherwise be
liable for any Losses or otherwise ( **AND PURCHASER, FOR ITSELF AND THE OTHER
PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS, HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES AND FULLY DISCHARGES
SELLERS** ) for aggregate damages and Losses in excess of fifteen percent
(15%) of the Purchase Price (in each case) with respect to Sellers
indemnification obligations under **Section 11.3(a)** for breach of its
representations and warranties under this Agreement other than the Fundamental
Representations and the representations set forth in **Section 5.8**,
**REGARDLESS OF FAULT (excluding, however, any Seller Indemnified Person s
gross negligence or willful misconduct)**. Without limitation of the
foregoing, and notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in this
Agreement, except for any damages or losses relating to any Excluded Seller
Obligation, Sellers shall never be required to otherwise indemnify Purchaser,
or otherwise be liable for any Losses or otherwise ( **AND PURCHASER, FOR
ITSELF AND THE OTHER PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS, HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES
AND FULLY DISCHARGES SELLERS** ) for aggregate damages and Losses in excess
one hundred percent (100%) of the Purchase Price (inclusive of the aggregate
damages for which Purchaser may be indemnified pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, which are limited to fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase
Price), **REGARDLESS OF FAULT (including, for purposes of this sentence only,
regardless of any Seller Indemnified Person s gross negligence or willful
misconduct)**.

 



 

(e) The sole and exclusive remedy of the parties with respect to the purchase
and sale of the Assets and the Interests shall be pursuant to the express
provisions of this Agreement and the parties rights at law or in equity under
any agreement delivered between the parties at Closing, including the
Conveyance and Purchasers rights with respect to the special warranty of
title thereunder. Without limitation of the foregoing, if the Closing occurs,
the sole and exclusive

 



      
 

 



 

remedy of the parties for any and all (a) claims relating to any
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements that are contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered at Closing, (b) other claims
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement and (c) other claims relating
to the Assets and the Interests and the purchase and sale thereof, shall be
(x) any right to indemnification from such claims that is expressly provided
in this Agreement and (y) the rights of the parties at law or in equity under
any other agreement delivered between the parties at Closing.

 



 

(f) For purposes of determining any Losses that are subject to indemnification
under **Section 11.3** or **Section 11.4**, the words "Material Adverse
Effect," "material adverse effect," "material," "materially," and words of
similar import in the applicable representations and warranties shall be
disregarded with regard to the calculation of such Losses only, but this
calculation shall only occur after the determination of breach of the
applicable representation and warranty, as written (with all "Material Adverse
Effect," "material adverse effect," "material," "materially," or other
qualifiers therein having been applied).

 



 

 **Section 11.3** **_Indemnification by Sellers_**. Subject to the terms,
conditions, and limitations of this **Article 11**, from and after the
Closing, Sellers hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser
and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, members, partners, agents, consultants, advisors and other
representatives (including legal counsel, accountants and financial advisors)
and the successors and permitted assigns of this Agreement of Purchaser
(collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Persons") from and against any and
all Losses asserted against, resulting from, imposed upon, or incurred or
suffered by any Purchaser Indemnified Person to the extent resulting from,
arising out of or relating to any of the following **REGARDLESS OF FAULT** :

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate furnished by or on behalf of Sellers in
connection with this Agreement;

 



 

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement of Sellers contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
furnished by or on behalf of Sellers in connection with this Agreement;

 



 

(c) any Excluded Seller Obligations;

 



 

(d) claims for personal injury and/or death arising from operations on or in
connection with the ownership of the Combined Assets conducted by or
chargeable to Sellers or any of their Affiliates prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(e) any mispayment or nonpayment of any royalties, overriding royalties,
productions and other similar burdens on production attributable and allocable
to the Combined Assets and payable by Sellers or the Companies prior to the
Effective Time (but excluding any Suspense Funds for which the Purchase Price
was reduced pursuant to this Agreement);

 



 

(f) any mispayment or nonpayment of amounts owed to current or former co-
tenants or working interest owners of the properties underlying any of the
Combined Assets that as of

 



      
 

 



 

the Effective Time were payable by any of the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates or any of the Companies;

 



 

(g) any criminal liability, criminal sanctions, acts or omissions of gross
negligence or willful misconduct of any Seller Indemnified Person or any
Company related to or arising out of the ownership or operation of the
Combined Assets prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(h) except with respect to any Environmental Liabilities, any fines, sanctions
or penalties imposed or assessed by any Governmental Bodies related to or
arising out of the ownership or operation of the Combined Assets prior to the
Closing Date;

 



 

(i) the disposal or transportation of any Hazardous Substances by or
chargeable to Sellers or their Affiliates attributable to the ownership or
operation of the Combined Assets to any location not on the Combined Assets or
lands pooled or unitized therewith prior to the Closing Date; and/or

 



 

(j) any actions, suits or proceedings that are pending prior to the Closing
Date and the matters described in **_Schedule 5.7(a)_** or **_Schedule
5.7(b)_** (in each case) to the extent related to or arising out of the
ownership or operation of the Combined Assets for periods prior to the Closing
Date; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing indemnity obligation shall not
apply with respect to the matter set forth on **_Schedule 5.7(a_ ) **styled as
Burr, Jolene, _et al._ v. XTO Energy, Inc., _et al._ , In the District Court,
New Town, North Dakota, Three Affiliated Tribes, Fort Berthold Indian
Reservation, Case No. CV-2014-0048, to the extent of obligations, liabilities
and Losses, if any, that are attributable to, or relating to, operations from
and after the Closing Date.

 



 

 **Section 11.4** **_Indemnification by Purchaser_**. From and after the
Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this **Article 11**,
Purchaser and the Companies hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Sellers and their Affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders, members, partners, agents, consultants,
advisors and other representatives (including legal counsel, accountants and
financial advisors) and the successors and permitted assigns of this Agreement
of Sellers (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons") from and against
any and all Losses, asserted against, resulting from, imposed upon, or
incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Person, directly or indirectly,
to the extent resulting from, arising out of, or relating to the following:

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate furnished by or on behalf of Purchaser to
Sellers in connection with this Agreement **REGARDLESS OF FAULT** ;

 



 

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement **REGARDLESS OF FAULT** or
any certificate furnished by or on behalf of Purchaser to Sellers in
connection with this Agreement;

 



 

(c) the ownership, use or operation of the Combined Assets after the Effective
Time, **REGARDLESS OF FAULT** ;

 



 

(d) the ownership of the Interests, whether before, on or after the Effective
Time, **REGARDLESS OF FAULT** ;

 



       
 

 



 

(e) the Assumed Seller Obligations **REGARDLESS OF FAULT** ;

 



 

(f) the indemnity obligation set forth in this **Section 4.4**; and

 



 

(g) subject to Purchasers rights under **Section 4.3**, Environmental Laws,
Environmental Defects, Environmental Liabilities, the release of materials
into the environment or protection of human health, safety, natural resources
or the environment, or any other environmental condition of the Assets,
**REGARDLESS OF THE TIME OF OCCURRENCE AND REGARDLESS OF FAULT** ,

 



 

provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be obligated to indemnify, defend
or hold harmless any Seller Indemnified Person pursuant to the foregoing for
any Losses that are covered by an indemnity of Sellers, to the extent and for
the periods that Sellers are obligated hereunder to provide such indemnity
therefor under **Section 11.3.**

 



 

 **Section 11.5** **_Indemnification Proceedings_**.

 



 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which Sellers or Purchaser (such
Person, an "Indemnifying Party") may be liable to a Purchaser Indemnified
Person under **Section 11.3** or to a Seller Indemnified Person under
**Section 11.4** (an "Indemnified Party") is asserted against or sought to be
collected from an Indemnified Party by a Third Party (a "Third Party Claim"),
the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness notify the Indemnifying
Party of such Third Party Claim by delivery of a Claim Notice, provided that
the failure or delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this **Article 11**, except (and
solely) to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that its
defense of such Third Party Claim is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of
the Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party (in this **Section 11.5**, the
"Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not the
Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense,
to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand; provided, that
the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice
Period, and at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file any
motion, answer or other pleading that it shall reasonably deem necessary to
protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim only if and for so long as the Indemnifying Party (i)
notifies the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period that the Indemnifying
Party is assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim, and (ii) conducts the
defense of such Third Party Claim in a diligent manner. If the Indemnifying
Party is entitled to, and does, assume the defense of any such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
at its own expense and to participate in the defense thereof; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay
the reasonable attorneys fees of the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified
Partys counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party that there is a
conflict of interest that could make it inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct to have common counsel for the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party it being understood and agreed, however, that
the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for paying for more

 



      
 

 



 

than one separate firm of attorneys and one local counsel to represent all of
the Indemnified Parties subject to such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects (and is entitled) to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, (i) no compromise or settlement thereof or consent
to any admission or the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party
Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified
Partys written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid
in full by the Indemnifying Party (and no injunctive or other equitable relief
is imposed upon the Indemnified Party) and there is an unconditional provision
whereby each plaintiff or claimant in such Third Party Claim releases the
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement thereof effected without its written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim (or fails to give
notice to the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period or otherwise is not
entitled to assume such defense), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its own choice,
at the expense and for the account of the Indemnifying Party; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of
any Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to control (but shall be entitled to participate at its own expense
in the defense of), and the Indemnified Party, shall be entitled to have sole
control over, the defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment of any Third Party Claim (i) at the reasonable expense of the
Indemnifying Party, as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the
defense during the Notice Period after the Indemnified Party gives notice
thereof to the Indemnifying Party or (ii) at the reasonable expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to the extent the Third Party Claim seeks an order,
injunction, or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party which, if
successful, could materially adversely affect the business, condition
(financial or other), capitalization, assets, liabilities, results of
operations or prospects of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
make no settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give
rise to liability on the part of the Indemnifying Party without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(e) In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks indemnification hereunder
and no Third Party Claim is involved, the Indemnified Party shall deliver a
Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party within a reasonably prompt period of
time after an officer of such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates has obtained
actual knowledge of the Loss giving rise to indemnification hereunder. The
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this **Article 11** except to the extent such
failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the
Indemnifying Party to effectively mitigate the resulting Losses or otherwise
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

 **Section 11.8** **_Waiver of Trade Practices Acts_**.

 



 

(a) It is the intention of the parties that Purchasers rights and remedies
with respect to this transaction and with respect to all acts or practices of
Sellers, past, present or future, in connection with this transaction shall be
governed by legal principles other than the Texas Deceptive Trade
PracticesConsumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. and Com. Code Ann. § 17.41 _et
seq_. (the "DTPA"). As such, to the extent applicable, Purchaser hereby waives
the applicability of the DTPA to this transaction and any and all duties,
rights or remedies that might be imposed by the DTPA, whether such duties,
rights and remedies are applied directly by the DTPA itself or indirectly in
connection with other statutes. Purchaser acknowledges, represents and
warrants that it is purchasing the goods and/or services covered by this
Agreement for commercial or business use; that it has or will have assets as
of the Closing of $25,000,000 or more; that it has knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that enable it to evaluate the merits

 



      
 

 



 

and risks of a transaction such as this; and that it is not in a significantly
disparate bargaining position with Sellers.

 



 

(b) Purchaser expressly recognizes that the price for which Sellers have
agreed to perform their obligations under this Agreement has been predicated
upon the inapplicability of the DTPA and this waiver of the DTPA. Purchaser
further recognizes that Sellers, in determining to proceed with the entering
into this Agreement, have expressly relied on this waiver and the
inapplicability of the DTPA.

 



 

(c) In addition to the foregoing, and in order to ensure compliance with
Texas DTPA Section 17.42(c), Purchaser waives all rights it may possess, if
any, under the DTPA with the following certification:

 



 

 **WAIVER OF RIGHTS**

 



 

 **PURCHASER WAIVES ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES-CONSUMER
PROTECTION ACT, SECTION 17.41 ET SEQ., BUSINESS and COMMERCE CODE, A LAW THAT
GIVES CONSUMERS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS. AFTER CONSULTATION WITH AN
ATTORNEY OF ITS OWN SELECTION, PURCHASER VOLUNTARILY CONSENTS TO THIS
WAIVER**.

 



 

 **Section 11.9** **_Recording_**. As soon as practicable after Closing,
Purchaser shall record the Conveyance in the appropriate counties where the
Assets located and provide Sellers with copies of all recorded or approved
instruments. The Conveyance in the form attached as **Exhibit B** is intended
to convey all of the Assets being conveyed pursuant to this Agreement. Certain
Assets or specific portions of the Assets that are leased from, or require the
approval to transfer by, a Governmental Body are conveyed under the Conveyance
and also are described and covered under separate assignments made by Sellers
to Purchaser on officially approved forms, or forms acceptable to such entity,
in sufficient multiple originals to satisfy applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements. The interests conveyed by such separate assignments
are the same, and not in addition to, the interests conveyed in the Conveyance
attached as **Exhibit B**. Further, such assignments shall be deemed to
contain all of the exceptions, reservations, rights, titles, power and
privileges set forth herein and in the Conveyance as fully and only to the
extent as though they were set forth in each such separate assignment.

 



 

 **Section 11.10** **_Mutual Release_**. Except for any Losses covered by the
indemnities set forth in this Agreement and except for any rights of any party
arising under any document executed and delivered at Closing in connection
with the transaction contemplated hereby, from and after the Closing, each of
Sellers, on the one hand, and each Company, on the other hand (in each case, a
"Releasing Party"), hereby releases and discharges each other and each of
their respective managers, directors, officers, partners, members,
equityholders, employees, agents, consultants, attorneys, representatives,
successors, transferees and assignees (collectively, the " **Released
Parties** ") from any and all obligations (including indemnification
obligations) and Losses, known and unknown, that such Releasing Party had, has
or may claim to have had or have against a Released Party in its capacity as a
direct or indirect member, officer, manager or other capacity of or with, or
contractual or other arrangement with, a Company, as applicable,

 



      
 

 



 

including any and all Losses, (whether such obligations or Losses arise in
tort, contract, or statute and whether known or unknown,) (a) arising under a
Companys organizational or governing documents, any contract, or any
applicable statute of any Governmental Body, (b) relating to any of the
Combined Assets, or (c) relating to actions or omissions of any Released
Party, including those committed while serving in their capacity as members,
managers, directors, officers, partners, members, equityholders, employees,
agents, consultants, attorneys, representatives, or similar or dissimilar
capacities. **THE RELEASES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 11.10 SHALL APPLY
REGARDLESS OF FAULT, AND REGARDLESS OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE.**

Guarantees_**. The parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of
credit and guarantees, if any, posted by Sellers or any of their Affiliates
with Governmental Bodies and relating to the Combined Assets may be

caused to be obtained in the name of Purchaser, replacements for such bonds,

contained may be waived in writing, but not in any other manner, by the party
or parties to whom such compliance is owed. No waiver of, or consent to a
change in, any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall

unless otherwise expressly provided.

 



 

 **Section 12.10** **_Assignment_**. Subject to the provisions of **Section
7.8(f)**, no party shall assign all or any part of this Agreement, nor shall
any party assign any of its rights or duties hereunder, without the prior

that is material and adverse to the interests of the Debt Financing Sources
without the written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

 



 

 **Section 12.13** **_No Third-Party Beneficiaries_**. Nothing in this
Agreement shall entitle any Person other than Purchaser or Sellers to any
claims, remedy or right of any kind, except as to those rights expressly

and made a part hereof.

 



 

 **Section 12.15** **_Construction_**. Purchaser is a party capable of making
such investigation, inspection, review and evaluation of the Combined Assets
and the Interests as a prudent party would deem appropriate under the
circumstances including with respect to all matters relating to the Combined
Assets and the Interests, their value, operation and suitability. Sellers and
Purchaser have each had substantial input into the drafting and preparation of
this Agreement and has had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in
relation to the negotiation of the details of the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement is the result of arms-length negotiations from equal
bargaining positions. In the event of a dispute over the meaning or
application of this Agreement, it shall be construed fairly and reasonably and
neither more strongly for nor against either party.

 



 

 **Section 12.16** **_Conspicuousness_**. The parties agree that provisions
in this Agreement in "bold" and/or "ALL CAPS" type satisfy any requirements of
the "express negligence rule" and any other requirements at law or in equity
that provisions be conspicuously marked or highlighted.

 



 

 **Section 12.17** **_Severability_**. If any term or other provisions of
this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under
any rule of law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in a
materially adverse manner with respect to either party; provided, however,
that if any such term or provision may be made enforceable by limitation
thereof, then such term or provision shall be deemed to be so limited and
shall be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

 **Section 12.18** **_Time of Essence_**. Time is of the essence in this
Agreement. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or
taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any
notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date which is
not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such
action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is required
to be given or action taken) shall be the next day which is a Business Day.

 



 

 **Section 12.19** **_Limitation on Damages_**. **NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER
PROVISION CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, THE PARTIES
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT AUTHORIZE ONE PARTY TO SUE FOR OR
COLLECT FROM THE OTHER PARTY ITS OWN PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ITS OWN
CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY WAIVES FOR ITSELF
AND ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATES, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS IT MAY HAVE AGAINST THE
OTHER PARTY FOR ITS OWN SUCH DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE**

 



      
 

 



 

 **TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF
FAULT (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THIS AGREEMENT).**

 



 

 **Section 12.20** **_Suspended Funds_**. At Closing, the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted for all funds which Sellers or any of their Affiliates is
holding as of the Closing Date which are owing to third party owners of
royalty, overriding royalty, working or other interests in respect of past
production of oil, gas or other hydrocarbons attributable to the Combined
Assets ("Suspended Funds"). Sellers covenant to deliver to Purchaser, within
thirty (30) days after Closing, in Microsoft Excel format, the owner name,
owner number, social security or federal ID number, reason for suspense, and
the amount of suspense funds payable for each entry, together with monthly
line item production detail including gross and net volumes and deductions for
all suspense entries. Upon receipt of such information, Purchaser shall
administer all such accounts and assume all payment obligations relating to
the Suspended Funds in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations, and shall be liable for the payment thereof to the proper
parties.

 



 

 **Section 12.21** **_Guaranty_**. For good and valuable consideration, and
to induce Sellers and the Companies to enter into this Agreement, Guarantor
hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Purchaser the
punctual and complete payment of all liabilities of Sellers and the Companies
under this Agreement and under any document executed and delivered by any
Seller or any Company (excluding obligations of Companies under **Section
11.4** and excluding any other post-Closing obligations or liabilities of the
Companies) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Obligations"). The guaranty set out in this **Section 12.21** (the "Parent
Guaranty") shall remain in full force and effect until Sellers and the
Companies have fully discharged all of the Obligations. Upon default by
Sellers or the Companies of any of the Obligations, Purchaser may proceed
directly against Guarantor without proceeding against Sellers or any other
Person or pursuing any other remedy. Purchaser may, without notice to, or
consent of, Guarantor, (i) extend or alter, together with Sellers, the time,
manner, place or terms of payment of the Obligations, (ii) waive, or, together
with Sellers, amend the terms of this Agreement, (iii) release Sellers from
any or all of the Obligations, or (iv) release any other guaranty or security
for the Obligations, without in any way releasing or discharging Guarantor
from liability hereunder. Guarantor is entitled to all defenses and limits of
liability (including rights of set-off or counterclaims) which it, Sellers or
the Companies may have with respect to the performance of the Obligations
under the terms of this Agreement; and Guarantors aggregate maximum liability
hereunder shall not exceed the limited liability of Sellers under this
Agreement. Guarantor further waives notice of the acceptance of this Parent
Guaranty, presentment, demand, protest, and notices of protest, nonpayment,
default or dishonor of the Obligations. Guarantor represents and warrants that
(A) it has the full power and authority to enter into and perform the Parent
Guaranty, (B) there are no bankruptcy, reorganization or receivership
proceedings pending, being contemplated by or, to Guarantors knowledge,
threatened against Guarantor, and Guarantor is not insolvent or generally not
paying its debts as they become due, and (C) the execution, delivery and
performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty has been duly and validly authorized
and approved by all necessary corporate action on the part of Guarantor, and
this Parent Guaranty constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 12.22** **_No Recourse_** **.** Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Sellers agree, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that (a) none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have any
liability to Seller or their Affiliates relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and (b) no Seller or any of
their Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing
Source under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by, or entered
into in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any commitments by the Debt Financing Sources in respect of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
