PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

  



  

This PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
September 30, 2016 (the " _date hereof_ "), is made by and between Credit
Suisse Alternative Capital, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Seller_ "), and Park South Funding, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Buyer_ "). Buyer and Seller are each referred to herein from time
to time as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_ ". Capitalized
terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in
_Article VIII_ below.

  



  

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, Credit Suisse Park View BDC, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "), commenced and consummated a tender
offer (the " _Tender Offer_ ") pursuant to which the Company purchased
1,353,988 shares of common stock (the " _Common Stock_ "), par value $0.01
per share, of the Company;

  



  

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Tender Offer and on the date
hereof, (a) Seller consented to the withdrawal of the Company's election to
be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the " _Investment Company Act_ "), and the Company filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a withdrawal
of election to be treated as a business development company, and (b) the
Company filed with the SEC an amendment to registration statement on Form N-2
(File No. 333-198981) (as amended and supplemented from time to time (the "
_Registration Statement_ ") under the Securities Act to deregister all unsold
Common Stock under the Registration Statement;

  



  

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Seller owns, beneficially and of record, all
of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell and Buyer desires to acquire one hundred
percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the Company
(the " _Transaction_ "), which, as of the date hereof, consists of 22,114,476
shares of Common Stock (the " _Purchased Shares_ "), all of which are owned
by Seller as of the date hereof.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

  



  

Article I

  



  

 _PURCHASE and sale_

  



  

1.01 _Purchase and Sale of the Purchased Shares_. On the terms set
forth in this Agreement, and in reliance on the representations and
the warranties of the Parties, Seller hereby sells, assigns, transfers and
conveys to Buyer, and Buyer hereby purchases and acquires from Seller, the
Purchased Shares.

  



  

1.02 _Closing Calculations_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
delivered to Buyer a written statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_
") setting forth:

  



    



 



    



  

(a) Seller's good faith estimate of Indebtedness as of immediately
prior to the Closing, which is $111,658,589.09 (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_
"), including the Payoff Amount as a separate line item, which is
$111,658,589.09;

  



  

(b) Seller's good faith estimate of Transaction Expenses, which are
$3,467,008.18 (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ");

  



  

(c) Seller's good faith estimate of the Adjustment Amount, which is
$7,032,847.00 (the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_ "), and

  



  

(d) the Estimated Consideration, which is $161,726,518.73.

  



  

The Estimated Closing Statement and all items included therein will
include materials showing in reasonable detail Seller's support and
computations for the amounts included therein.

  



  

1.03 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Buyer will prepare and deliver to Seller, no later than 90 days
after the Closing Date (the " _90-Day Period_ "), a written statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Buyer's determination of (i) the
Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) Transaction
Expenses and (iii) the Adjustment Amount. The Closing Statement and all
items included therein will include materials showing in reasonable detail
Buyer's support and computations for the amounts included therein. If Buyer
does not deliver the Closing Statement to Seller within the 90-Day Period,
Buyer will be deemed to have waived the right to object to any items set
forth in the Estimated Closing Statement and all such items will be deemed to
be final and binding on the Parties and will be non-appealable and may be
enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction for purposes of determining the
Final Consideration, as described below in this _Section 1.03_.

  



  

(b) During the 45-day period following Seller's receipt of the
Closing Statement (such period, the " _Response Period_ "), Buyer will
provide Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access to the Group
Companies' accounting records and personnel that relate to the items in the
Closing Statement as reasonably requested by Seller. If Seller claims that
Buyer has failed to comply with its obligation under this _Section 1.03(b)_
to provide reasonable access to such accounting records and personnel, Seller
must submit such claim for resolution to the Accounting Firm, which will have
the authority to determine such matter and, to the extent that Buyer has so
failed to comply, to extend the Response Period until the date that is 30 days
after Buyer complies with its access obligations hereunder. Prior to the
expiration of the Response Period, Seller may deliver a written objection
to Buyer's calculation of the items stated in the Closing Statement,
identifying each item (i.e., on an item-by-item basis) in dispute (each, a "
_Disputed Item_ ") and the dollar amount in dispute for each Disputed Item
(the " _Objection Statement_ "). If Seller chooses to deliver an Objection
Statement during the Response Period, Seller will also deliver materials
showing in reasonable detail Seller's basis, support and computations for its
position and the amounts it claims are in dispute or that differ between the
Closing Statement and the Objection Statement. Seller will be deemed to have
waived the right to object to any item set forth in the Closing Statement
unless Seller furnishes the Objection Statement to Buyer within the Response
Period and such item is included in such Objection Statement. In the case of
such waiver, all items stated in the Closing Statement will be deemed to be
final and binding on the Parties and will be non-appealable and may be
enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction for purposes of this Agreement,
including determining the Final Consideration. If Seller delivers
an Objection Statement within the Response Period, then Buyer and Seller will
use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve their differences
in good faith within 10 days after the delivery of the Objection Statement.

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all of the Disputed
Items after such 10-day period, Buyer or Seller shall submit the
remaining unresolved Disputed Items to be resolved by EisnerAmper or, if such
firm is unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under this _Section
1.03_, such other accounting firm as Buyer and Seller mutually agree upon (the
" _Accounting Firm_ "). Within five days of the Accounting Firm's request,
both Buyer and Seller will enter into the Accounting Firm's
standard engagement letter and both will instruct the Accounting Firm to
resolve each of the remaining Disputed Items (but no other items) within 30
days of being engaged. The cost of any retainer payment required by the
Accounting Firm will be paid equally by Buyer and Seller, subject to ultimate
apportionment as provided in this _Section 1.03(c)_. Buyer and Seller will
cooperate with the Accounting Firm in all reasonable respects, but neither
Party will have ex parte meetings, teleconferences or other
correspondence with the Accounting Firm, as it is intended for each of Buyer
and Seller to be included in all discussions and correspondence with the
Accounting Firm. In resolving each of the Disputed Items, the Accounting Firm
will be authorized only to choose between Seller's position as set forth in
the Objection Statement and Buyer's position as set forth in the Closing
Statement, but recognizing that the Accounting Firm may resolve the Disputed
Items on an item by item basis so that it may choose Seller's position as set
forth in the Objection Statement, on some items and Buyer's position as set
forth in the Closing Statement, on other items. The Accounting Firm will
notify Buyer and Seller in writing of its resolution of each of the Disputed
Items, together with a reasonably detailed explanation of its determination
of each Disputed Item, and its calculation of Indebtedness as of
immediately prior to the Closing, the Transaction Expenses and the Adjustment
Amount based on its resolution of the Disputed Items. The fees and expenses
of the Accounting Firm will be apportioned equitably by the Accounting Firm
based on the degree to which each Party failed to prevail in its position.
The determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to the Disputed Items
and the apportionment of fees and expenses will, absent manifest error, be
final and binding on the Parties, will be non-appealable and may be
enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction.

  



  

(d) The final Transaction Expenses (the " _Final Transaction
Expenses_ "), the final Indebtedness (the " _Final Indebtedness_ ") and the
final Adjustment Amount (the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ ") will be as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 1.03(a)_,  _Section 1.03(b)_ and _Section
1.03(c)_.

  



  

(e) If the Final Consideration exceeds the Estimated Consideration,
Buyer will pay promptly (but in any event within three Business
Days following the final determination of the Final Consideration) to Seller,
the excess of the Final Consideration over the Estimated Consideration by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated in writing by Seller.

(a)  Immediately following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
Company to execute and deliver to Seller the Homeland Assignments,
which represent all of the Homeland Loans and the all of the Homeland Equity.
If following the Closing, Buyer or the Company, or any Affiliate of Buyer or
the Company, receives any amount (including in respect of accrued interest)
under the Homeland Loans or any amount under the Homeland Reimbursement
Agreement, Buyer shall promptly, but in no event later than the tenth Business
Day, following the receipt by Buyer, the Company or such Affiliate of such
amount, pay or cause to be paid such amount to Seller or Seller's designee.
Upon reasonable request by Seller and at the Seller's sole expense, during the
six months after Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to execute such
additional instruments as are necessary (i) to give effect to the assignments
contemplated by the Homeland Assignments and to provide Seller with the
benefits and burdens of the Homeland Loan and Homeland Equity and (ii) if the
necessary third party consents for the Company to assign the Homeland
Reimbursement Agreement are secured, to assign the Homeland Reimbursement
Agreement to Seller or Seller's designee.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in
the Homeland Loan Assignment, Seller hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
(i) disclaims all representations and warranties made by the Company in the
Homeland Loan Assignment and (ii) agrees and covenants not to commence or
threaten to commence any claim, sue or threaten to sue or otherwise seek to
obtain any economic, equitable or judicial or extra-judicial relief for or in
connection with any breach of any representations or warranties made by the
Company in the Homeland Loan Assignment.

and operate the properties and assets it owns, leases and operates, and to
carry on its business as such business is now conducted, except where the
failure to be in good standing or to have such power and authority would not,

is qualified to do business as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction in which
its ownership of property or the conduct of business as now conducted
requires it to qualify, except where failure to be so duly qualified would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

5.02 _Authority; Enforceability_. Buyer has the full power and
authority to execute this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which it is a party and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party. The execution,

to which Buyer is a party have been duly and validly authorized by all
required action on behalf of Buyer. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Buyer and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Seller, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms,

threatened, action for the dissolution, liquidation or insolvency of
Buyer. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Seller, immediately after giving effect to the Transaction and the other
Transaction Documents, each Buyer will be Solvent. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, means
that, as of any date of determination (a) the amount of the "fair saleable
value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (ii) the

indemnification agreements with such Indemnified Person as in effect on the
date hereof set forth in _Section 6.03(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules,

Seller (or an Affiliate of Seller, as applicable) be required to expend

for a period of six years and are expressly intended to benefit each of the
Indemnified Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any claim
or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within such six-year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims
shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims.

  



  

(e) In the event Buyer or the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person

to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract
or otherwise. This _Section 6.03_ may not be amended, altered or repealed

Indemnified Person or any of their heirs without the prior written consent of
the affected Indemnified Person.

this Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by Buyer and Seller and

without the prior written consent of the other Party, issue any press release
or make any public announcement or statement as may be required by applicable
Legal Requirements or the applicable rules of any national securities
exchange; provided that such Party provides as much advance notice as
practicable and, if practicable, consults with such other Party prior to
making such public announcement or statement.

Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries

Companies, which novation shall be effective immediately after the completion

incidental or otherwise, known or unknown, in its own right or derivatively,
in Law or equity, to the extent arising out of or relating to (a) Seller's
ownership of the Common Stock and/or other equity interests of the Company or
Seller's being or having been a stockholder of the Company or (b)
any Affiliate Contract, other than the Surviving Indemnification Agreements.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense
of any Third Party Claim, at the Indemnifying Party's sole expense, 
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or

than monetary payments entirely indemnified by the Indemnifying Party or (B)
such settlement is consented to in writing by the Indemnified Party, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall have the right (but not the obligation) to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ, at its own expense, counsel
separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party; except that the
fees, costs and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the

agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or scanned pages via electronic mail, will be treated in

the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No Party will raise the use of a facsimile
machine or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
or email as a defense to the formation of a contract and each Party forever
waives any such defense. This Agreement is not binding unless and until

9.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously
in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all
of which will constitute one agreement. Execution and delivery of this
Agreement by exchange of electronically transmitted counterparts bearing the
signature of a Party will be equally as effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of such Party.

  



  

9.17 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the exhibits and schedules hereto will be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Legal Requirements of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Legal Requirements of any jurisdiction other than the
State of New York.

  



  

9.18 _Jurisdiction_. Any Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the Transaction will be brought and determined exclusively
in any federal or state court located in the County of New York, New York,
and each of the Parties hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Legal
Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in any such court
or that any such Legal Proceeding that is brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Legal Proceeding may be
served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party
agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in _Section 9.05_
will be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

  



  

9.19 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

9.20 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) Each Party agrees that irreparable damage would occur and that
the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, in addition to
any other remedies available under this Agreement, the Parties agree that each
Party will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent the other Party's breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives (i) any
defenses in any Legal Proceeding for an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief, including the defense that the other Party has an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity and (ii) any
requirement under any Legal Requirement to post a bond, undertaking or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 9.21 _Disclosure Schedules_. All Disclosure Schedules attached
hereto (each, a " _Schedule_ " and, collectively, the "
_Disclosure Schedules_ ") are incorporated herein and expressly made a part
of this Agreement as though completely set forth herein. All references to
this Agreement herein or in any of the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to
refer to this entire Agreement, including all Disclosure Schedules. The
Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for purposes of convenience in
separately numbered sections corresponding to the sections of this Agreement;
provided, however, that any item disclosed in any part, subpart, section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedule referenced by a particular section or
subsection in this Agreement will be deemed to have been disclosed with
respect to every other section and subsection in this Agreement if the
relevance of such disclosure to such other section or subsection is
reasonably apparent, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-
reference. Any item of information, matter or document disclosed or
referenced in, or attached to, the Disclosure Schedules will not (a) be used
as a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "Material Adverse Effect"
or other similar terms in this Agreement or to establish a standard of
materiality, (b) represent a determination that such item or matter did not
arise in the Ordinary Course of Business, (c) be deemed or interpreted to
expand the scope of Seller's representations and warranties, obligations,
covenants or agreements contained herein, (d) constitute, or be deemed to
constitute, an admission of liability or obligation regarding such matter,
(e) represent a determination that the consummation of the Transaction
requires the consent of any third party or (f) constitute, or be deemed to
constitute, an admission to any third party concerning such item or
matter. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise
defined therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement.

  



  

9.22 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that WFandG has acted as legal
counsel to Seller, the Company, their respective Affiliates and the Group
Companies prior to the Closing, and that WFandG intends to act as legal counsel
to Seller and certain of its Affiliates after the Closing, Buyer, on its own
behalf and, effective as of the Closing, on behalf of the Group Companies
hereby waives, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts
that may arise in connection with WFandG representing any of Seller and/or its
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, any
Group Company or the Transaction. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences among Seller and its Affiliates in the course of
the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transaction shall be
deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to Seller and its
Affiliates (and not the Group Companies). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, from and after the Closing (a) Seller and its Affiliates (and
not the Group Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client
privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the Group Companies
shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of WFandG in respect of
such engagement constitute property of the client, only Seller and its
Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall hold such property rights and
(c) WFandG shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group Companies by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between WFandG and any of the Group
Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Buyer or any of the Group Companies, on the one
hand, and a third party (other than a Party or its Affiliates), on the other
hand, after the Closing, Buyer (including, effective as of the Closing, on
behalf of the Group Companies) may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by WFandG to such third
party; _provided_ , that neither Buyer nor any of the Group Companies may
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller.
