Surviving Corporation.   

2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.   

(a) Promptly, and in any event no later than three business days after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective

_Certificates__ ") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Parent, and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify and which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Closing Price Per Series B-1 Share, Closing Price Per Series
A-1 Share or the Closing Price Per Common Share, as appropriate. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other

equal to the number of shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such
certificate multiplied by the Closing Price Per Series B-1 Share, Closing
Price Per Series A-1 Share or the Closing Price Per Common Share, as
appropriate (the " _ _Aggregate Closing Price Per Certificate__ "), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate that, prior to the
Effective Time, represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, to evidence the right only to receive the
appropriate price per share for the shares of Company Capital Stock
represented thereby multiplied by the number of such shares, without
interest.   

(b) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
of shares of Company Capital Stock for any amount properly delivered to a
public official in compliance with any abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates representing shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Capital Stock, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or
by law.   

(d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, and complying with such other conditions as Parent may
reasonably impose (including the execution of an indemnification undertaking
in favor of Parent with respect to the Certificate alleged to be lost, stolen
or destroyed), Parent will deliver to such Person, the Aggregate Closing
Price Per Certificate in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.   

(e) If any holder of Dissenting Shares becomes entitled to receive payment for
such shares pursuant to applicable law and Section 2.9 hereof, such payment
will be made by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 2.9
hereof.   

2.4 _Company Options/Company Warrants_.   

(a) Each unexercised Qualified Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time for which a validly executed consent substantially in the form
set forth in _Exhibit D-1_ hereto has been received prior to the Effective
Time will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into and become a
right to receive an amount equal to (A) the Common Price Per Share in excess
of the exercise price of such Qualified Option (the " _ _Option Spread__ ")
times (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such
Qualified Option is exercisable. Each unexercised Qualified Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for which no validly
executed consent has been received prior to the Effective Time shall remain a
Qualified Option, exercisable in accordance with its terms, until such time
as the holder thereof shall validly execute and deliver to Parent or to
Surviving Corporation a consent, in form reasonably acceptable to
Parent, electing to receive the consideration described in this Section
2.4(a), at which point, such Qualified Option shall be cancelled and
extinguished and become a right to receive an amount equal to the Option
Spread times the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such
Qualified Option is exercisable.   

(b) Each unexercised Rolling Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished and there will be
substituted in exchange therefor an option (" _ _Parent Rollover Option__ ")
to purchase such number of shares of common stock of Parent equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
each such Rolling Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
the common stock of Parent), and the per share exercise price of the shares
of common stock of the Parent issuable upon the exercise of such Parent
Rollover Option will be equal to the exercise price per share of the Company
Common Stock at which such Rolling Option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent), with such substitution to be carried out in accordance
with the requirements of Treasury Regulations, Section 1.424-1(a) and Section
409A of the Code (and all parties agree to report the substitution
accordingly).   

(c) Each unexercised Out-of-the-Money Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished without the right to
receive any cash or other payment.   

(d) Each unexercised Qualified Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be canceled and extinguished and be converted into and
become a right to receive an amount equal to (A) the Common Price Per Share
in excess of the exercise price of such Qualified Warrant (the " _ _Warrant
Spread__ ") times (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for
which such Qualified Warrant is exercisable, _provided that_ , an amount
equal to the product of (X) the Warrant Spread, times (Y) the Escrow
Percentage (such amount to be referred to herein as the " _ _Per Warrant
Escrow Amount__ ") times (Z) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
for which such Qualified Warrant is exercisable will be delivered to the
Escrow Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof. The difference between
the Warrant Spread and the Per Warrant Escrow Amount is referred to herein as
the " _ _Closing Price Per Warrant__ ".   

(e) Each unexercised Out-of-the-Money Warrant outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished without the right to
receive any cash or other payment.   

(f) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, provided that prior to
the Effective Time Parent has received a validly executed consent in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit D-1_ containing an election to receive the
consideration described in Section 2.4(b) with respect to such Rolling
Option, Parent will substitute a Parent Rollover Option for each Rolling
Option, with such substitution to be carried out in compliance with the
requirements of Treasury Regulations, Section 1.424-1(a) and Section 409A of
the Code (and all parties agree to report the substitution accordingly). As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but subject to any withholding
tax requirement, the Surviving Corporation will pay to the holder of each
Qualified Option an amount equal to (A) the Option Spread times (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock for which each such Qualified Option
was exercisable, without interest, _provided, however_ , that no holder of a
Company Option shall be entitled to receive the amount described in this
sentence unless and until such holder has validly executed and delivered to
Parent a consent substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D-1_.
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but subject to any
withholding tax requirement and provided that the amendment described
in Section 7.2(g) has been validly completed, the Surviving Corporation will
pay to the holder of each Qualified Warrant an amount equal to (X) Closing
Price Per Warrant times (Y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for
which such Qualified Warrant was exercisable, without interest. All other
Company Options and Company Warrants, including all Out-of-the-Money Options
and Out-of-the-Money Warrants, will be canceled as of the Effective Time
without the right to receive any cash or other payment.   

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all action that may be
necessary (under the plans and agreements pursuant to which Company Options
are outstanding, the agreements pursuant to which Company Warrants are
outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.4
and to ensure that, from and after the Closing Date, holders of Company
Options and/or Company Warrants have no rights with respect thereto other
than those specifically provided in this Section 2.4.   

2.5 _Escrow_. An amount equal to $15,500,000 (the " _ _Escrow Amount__ ")
shall be deposited by Parent with U.S. Bank National Association, as escrow
agent selected by Parent (the " _ _Escrow Agent__ "), to be held in escrow
(the " _ _Escrow Fund__ ") in an account (the " _ _Escrow Account__ ")
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the " _ _Escrow Agreement__ ")
among Parent, the Stockholders Representative and the Escrow Agent
in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_. Distributions of
any amounts from the Escrow Account shall be governed by the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement. Specific reference is made to (i) Section
5 of the Escrow Agreement, which shall govern the disbursement of funds from
the Escrow Account to Parent for satisfaction of indemnification claims under
Article IX hereof, (ii) Sections 6(a)-(b) of the Escrow Agreement, which
shall govern the disbursement of funds from the Escrow Account to the holders
of Company Capital Stock and Qualified Warrants following the 15-month
anniversary of the Closing Date and (iii) Sections 6(c)-(d) of the
Escrow Agreement which shall govern the disbursement of funds from the Escrow
Account to the holders of Company Capital Stock and Qualified Warrants
following the three-year anniversary of the Closing Date. The portion of the
Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each holder of Company Capital Stock
or Qualified Warrants shall be the same proportion of the Escrow Amount equal
to the aggregate amount of cash such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive under Section 2.2 hereof by virtue of such holders ownership of
Company Capital Stock or Qualified Warrants to the total Merger Consideration
received by all such holders. For the avoidance of doubt, Qualified Options
and Rolling Options (and the respective Parent Rollover Options) shall not be
subject to the Escrow Fund.   

2.6 _Adjustment of Shares_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number, classes or series
of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock shall occur, including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split
or combination, exchange or readjustment of such shares of Company Capital
Stock, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period,
the Series B-1 Price Per Share, the Series A-1 Price Per Share, the Common
Price Per Share, the Option Spread, the Warrant Spread and the respective Per
Share Escrow Amounts or Per Warrant Escrow Amounts for each of the foregoing,
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as the case may
be, shall be appropriately adjusted.   

2.7 _Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the aggregate value delivered by Parent pursuant to this
Agreement (the " _ _Merger Consideration__ ") shall not exceed $155,000,000
_less_ the Transaction Expenses.   

2.8 _Tax Withholding_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Capital
Stock, Company Option or Company Warrant such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _ _Code__ "), or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Escrow Agent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to such holder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
Escrow Agent, as the case may be. To the extent any such amount is withheld,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall pay
such withheld amount to the appropriate Governmental Entity/Entities on a
timely basis and shall indemnify and hold harmless any holder of Company
Capital Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants for the payment of any
such withheld amount.   

2.9 _Dissenting Shares_.   

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Section 262
of the DGCL is applicable to the Merger, shares of Series B-1 Preferred
Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date and which are held by
stockholders who have not executed a written consent approving the Merger,
who will have delivered a written demand for the appraisal of such shares in
the manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and who, as of the Closing
Date, will not have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to dissenters
rights (" _ _Dissenting Shares__ ") shall not, upon the Closing, be converted
into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.2 hereof, but the holders thereof shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting
Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the DGCL.   

(b) The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal, any withdrawal of a demand for appraisal and any other instrument
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to participate, in consultation with the Company, in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
such Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company will not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demand for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demand.

available to Stockholders Representative and Stockholders Representatives
accountants and other representatives at reasonable times and upon reasonable
notice during (i) the review by Stockholders Representative of the
Measurement Date Balance Sheet and (ii) the resolution by Parent and
Stockholders Representative of any objections to the Measurement Date
Balance Sheet.   

(b) Stockholders Representative may object to the Measurement Date Balance
Sheet on the basis that it was not prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Latest Financial Statements
or that the calculation of Measurement Date Net Assets contains mathematical
errors. If Stockholders Representative has any objections to the Measurement
Date Balance Sheet or the Measurement Date Net Assets, Stockholders
Representative will deliver a detailed statement describing such objections
(the " _ _Statement of Objection__ ") to Parent within 20 days after
receiving the Measurement Date Balance Sheet. Parent and
Stockholders Representative will attempt in good faith to resolve any such
objections. If Parent and Stockholders Representative do not reach a
resolution of all objections within 30 days after Parent has received the
Statement of Objection, Parent and Stockholders Representative will select a
mutually acceptable independent accounting firm (the " _ _Independent
Accountant__ ") to resolve any remaining objections. If Parent and
Stockholders Representative are unable to agree on the choice of an
accounting firm, they will select a nationally recognized accounting firm by
lot (after excluding the regular outside accounting firms of Parent and the
Company). The selected Independent Accountant will resolve any such
objections and determine, in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the Latest Financial Statements, the
amounts to be included in the Measurement Date Balance Sheet and the
Measurement Date Net Assets. The parties will provide the Independent
Accountant, within 10 days of its selection, with a definitive statement of
the position of each party with respect to each unresolved objection and will
advise the Independent Accountant that the parties accept the Independent
Accountant as the appropriate Person to interpret this Agreement for all
purposes relevant to the resolution of the unresolved objections. Parent will
provide the Independent Accountant access to the books, records and personnel
of each of the Company and the Subsidiaries. The Independent Accountant will
have 30 days to carry out a review of the unresolved objections and prepare a
written statement of its determination regarding each unresolved objection.
The determination of any Independent Accountant so selected will be set forth
in writing and will be conclusive and binding upon the parties. Parent will
revise the Measurement Date Balance Sheet and the determination of the
Measurement Date Net Assets as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any
objections to the Measurement Date Balance Sheet pursuant to this Section
2.10.   

(c) If Parent and Stockholders Representative submit any unresolved
objections to the Independent Accountant for resolution as provided in this
Section 2.10, Parent and Stockholders Representative will each bear their
respective costs and expenses and will share equally in the fees and expenses
of the Independent Accountant.   

(d) If the Measurement Date Net Assets as finally determined is less than the
Latest Balance Sheet Net Assets Amount, then, within 10 business days after
the date on which the Measurement Date Net Assets is finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.10, an amount equal to the difference between (x)
the Measurement Date Net Assets as finally determined and (y) Latest Balance
Sheet Net Assets Amount will be withdrawn by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow
Account and paid to Parent. " _ _Latest Balance Sheet Net Assets Amount__ "
means $11,157,000.   

(e) Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.10 will not preclude any
remedy provided in this Agreement or otherwise for any breach of
representation, warranty or agreement, and the remedy provided in this
Agreement for any breach of representation, warranty or agreement or
otherwise will not preclude the adjustment provided in this Section
2.10.   

(f) Judgment upon the award rendered by the accounting firm may be entered in
any court of competent jurisdiction.   

(g) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the Measurement Date, it will not take any action specifically
designed to impair the Measurement Date Net Assets and has the primary
purpose of causing an adjustment pursuant to Section 2.10(d) hereof. The
Company, however, acknowledges that the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement constitute a transfer of control to Parent and that, following the
Closing Date, Parent and its representatives will exercise their business
judgment regarding the operations of the Surviving Corporation in a manner
consistent with Parents duties to its shareholders.   

Article III    

Representations and Warranties of the Company    

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent, and acknowledges that
Parent is relying upon the following representations and warranties, that,
except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule:   

3.1 _Incorporation; Corporate Power and Authority_.   

(a) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
incorporated (or the equivalent for those Subsidiaries in foreign
jurisdictions), validly existing, duly registered (in each case, if
applicable) and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization and has all requisite corporate power and authority
necessary to carry on its business as now being conducted and to own, lease
and operate its assets. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation to do business in every jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or its ownership of property requires it
to be so qualified, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to be
so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below). Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and complete list, by corporation, of all jurisdictions in
which the Company and each of the Subsidiaries is qualified and in good
standing, if applicable. As used herein, the term " _ _Material Adverse
Effect__ " means any change, effect, event or condition that (i) has had or
could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the business, assets (including intangible
assets), results of operations, or condition (financial or otherwise), of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the ability of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to materially achieve the
Companys revenue projections, recorded on a GAAP basis, pertaining to the
calendar year ending December 31, 2007, as delivered to Parent on July 19,
2007, other than any such change, effect, event or condition that results or
arises from (A) changes or conditions affecting the industry in which the
Company markets its products and services generally, except to the
extent such changes or conditions materially disproportionately affect the
Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) changes in general
economic, regulatory or political conditions, except to the extent such
changes or conditions materially disproportionately affect (relative to
other participants in the industry in which the Company markets its products
and services) the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (C) changes
in GAAP, (D) any change, effect, event or condition exclusively relating to
any acts of terrorism, sabotage, military action or war or (E) any change,
effect, event or condition arising solely and directly out of the
execution, delivery, performance or disclosure of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any impact thereof on
relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers or
distributors, and that would not have resulted or arisen in the absence of
such execution, delivery, performance (in accordance with its terms) or
disclosure (excluding from this subsection (E) all changes, effects, events
or conditions that existed prior to the date hereof), or (ii) would prevent
or materially delay the Companys ability to consummate the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby.   

(b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of any of the
provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or other applicable charter
document (any such document hereinafter referred to as its " _ _Charter
Documents__ ") or Bylaws or other applicable governing document (any such

Company has made available to Parent in the electronic data room hosted by

representative offices listed in Section 3.2(b) of the Disclosure Schedule.
Each Subsidiary, branch office and representative office has complied in all
material respects with the laws of each jurisdiction in which such

vote, directly or indirectly, of record, beneficially or otherwise, any
capital stock or any equity or ownership interests in any corporation,

Subsidiaries. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock and all equity

stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders) than the terms of this
Agreement (taking into account, among other things (1) the advice of its
outside legal counsel and its financial adviser, and (2) all terms of such
Takeover Proposal and this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by
Parent)) and to be reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms
proposed, taking into account legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects
of such Takeover Proposal and the Person making such Takeover
Proposal including, if such Takeover Proposal involves any financing, the
likelihood of obtaining such financing and the terms on which such financing
may be secured.   

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.4 hereof,
in the event that the Company receives, prior to the Required Stockholder
Vote (which may be obtained pursuant to the Company Stockholders Consent), a

be, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, it may then
take the following actions (but only (1) if and to the extent that (x) its
board of directors concludes in good faith, after receipt of advice of its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would create a substantial
risk of liability for breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable law and (y) the Company has given

2007, between Parent and the Company, and (B) contemporaneously with
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person furnishes such
nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously so furnished to Parent); and    

(ii) engage in negotiations with such Person or group with respect to such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall such party
enter into any definitive agreement to effect such Superior Proposal.   

(c) In response to the receipt of a bona fide Takeover Proposal which is
determined by the Companys board of directors to be a Superior Proposal, the
board of directors may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation

the case of a Superior Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer,
may recommend that its stockholders accept such tender or exchange offer (any
of the forgoing actions, whether by a board of directors or a committee
thereof, a " _ _Change of Recommendation__ ") if the board of directors of
the Company has concluded in good faith, after receipt of the advice of its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure
of the board of directors to effect a Change of Recommendation would create a
substantial risk of liability for breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable law.   

(d) Prior to announcing any Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section
6.5(c) hereof, the Company shall (A) provide to Parent three business days
prior written notice which shall (x) state expressly that it intends to
effect a Change of Recommendation and (y) describe any material modifications
to the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and the identity
of the Person or group making the Superior Proposal from the description of
such terms and conditions and such Person contained in the notice required
under Section 6.4 hereof; (B) make available to Parent all materials and
information made available to the Person or group making the Superior Proposal
in connection with such Superior Proposal, and (C) during the three business-
day period commencing upon receipt of the notice described in this Section
6.5(d)(A), if requested by Parent, engage in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Takeover Proposal
which was determined to be a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior
Proposal.   

(e) If the board of directors of the Company effects a Change of
Recommendation, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of such
Change of Recommendation. If the Company or Parent thereafter terminates this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(e) hereof, then the Company shall
promptly pay the Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to Section 8.3
hereof.   

(f) Nothing contained in Section 6.4 hereof or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders or any public announcement if, in the good faith judgment of the
board of directors of the Company, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure to so disclose would violate any applicable law or constitute the
breach of a fiduciary duty of the board of directors; provided that the
Company shall not, except in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.5(c)
hereof withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, its
recommendation of the Merger, or approve or recommend, or propose to approve
or recommend, a Takeover Proposal.   

6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company or Parent, as the case may
be, shall promptly notify the other party of (a) its obtaining of knowledge
as to the matters set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) below, or (b) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to
occur would be likely to cause (i) any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any
time from the date hereof to the Closing Date, (ii) any material failure of
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or of any officer, director,
employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement
or (iii) the institution of any claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out
of or related to the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby;

obligations of the parties hereunder.

Continuing Employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and (ii) as an
amendment or modification to any employment agreement in effect as of the
Effective Time. The employment of Continuing Employees will be "at
will" employment to the extent employment is "at will" as of the Effective
Time. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed so as to vest in any
Continuing Employee any third-party beneficiary right in the agreements of
the parties hereto contained in this Section 6.7 or otherwise.

all expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the DandO
Indemnified Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
for in this Section 6.8, provided that such DandO Indemnified Parties are
entitled to the indemnities sought. For six years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the current level and scope of
directors and officers liability insurance or a tail insurance policy of
the same level or scope for the six year period, in each case covering those
persons who are covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy as of the Effective Time (a copy of which has been
heretofore delivered to Parent); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of
200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
insurance, and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. This Section 6.8 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and

and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such options remain outstanding, subject in each case to policies and
practices generally applicable to options to purchase shares of common stock
of Parent at such time.

subject to the satisfaction or waiver (in the Companys sole discretion) of
each of the following conditions on or before the Closing Date:   

(a) _Representations and Warranties True and Correct_. The representations
and warranties set forth in Article IV hereof will be true and correct in all
material respects at and as of the Closing as though then made and as though
the Closing Date had been substituted for the date of this Agreement
throughout such representations and warranties except for inaccuracies
of such representations, the circumstances giving rise to which, individually
or in the aggregate, do not constitute and could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect (without giving effect to any limitation as
to "materiality" or "material adverse effect" set forth therein and without
taking into account any disclosures by the Parent of discoveries, events or
occurrences arising on or after the date hereof), except that any such
representation or warranty made as of a specified date (other than the date
hereof) shall only need to have been true on and as of such date;   

(b) _Covenants Performed_. Parent shall have performed in all material
respects all the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it
under this Agreement prior to the Closing;   

(c) _No Material Adverse Change_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, there shall not have occurred any event or circumstance, which
would result in or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent or Merger Sub (for purposes of this Section 7.3(c) and
Section 7.3(a) only, references made to the Company shall be replaced
by references to Parent in the definition of Material Adverse Effect in
Section 3.1(a) herein); and   

(d) _Delivery of Certain Documents_. On the Closing Date, Parent will have
delivered to the Company:    

(i) a certificate of an officer of Parent dated the Closing Date, stating that
the conditions precedent set forth in Sections 7.3(a) and 7.3(b) above have
been satisfied;    

(ii) a copy, fully executed by Parent and the Escrow Agent, of the Escrow
Agreement; and    

(iii) copies of the governmental consents and approvals referred to in
Sections 7.1(c) above.   

Article VIII    

Termination    

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:   

(a) by the mutual consent of Parent and the Company;   

(b) by either Parent or the Company if there has been a material
misrepresentation, material breach of warranty or breach of covenant on the
part of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other, in the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement and
such material misrepresentation or material breach of warranty or covenant is
not cured by the breaching party within 30 days following the receipt by the
breaching party of a notice from the non-breaching party of any such
breach;   

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the transactions contemplated hereby
have not been consummated by January 31, 2008; _provided_ , _that_ , neither
Parent nor the Company will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.1(c) if Parents or the Companys, respectively, willful
breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby;   

(d) by Parent if, after the date hereof, there shall have been a Material
Adverse Effect or if after the date hereof, an event shall have occurred
which, so far as reasonably can be foreseen, would result in any Material
Adverse Effect; except to the extent that the Company is capable of taking
action to cure the Material Adverse Effect and the Company has taken such
action within 30 days following written notice from Parent that such a change
or such an event has occurred; or   

(e) by the Company or Parent if the board of directors of the Company effects
a Change of Recommendation in response to a Takeover Proposal but only after
the Company provides written notice to Parent advising Parent that the board
of directors of the Company has received a Takeover Proposal and specifying
the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and
identifying the Person making such Takeover Proposal.   

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 8.1 hereof, all
provisions of this Agreement shall terminate and there shall be no liability
on the part of Parent or the Company or their respective shareholders,
stockholders, officers, or directors, _except that_ : (i) Sections 8.3
(termination fee), 10.1 (press releases), 10.2 (expenses) and 10.12
(governing law) hereof shall survive indefinitely, and (ii) notwithstanding
the foregoing, the parties shall remain liable for their willful or
fraudulent breaches of this Agreement prior to the time of such
termination.   

8.3 _Termination Fee_. In the event that the Company or Parent terminates
this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1(e) hereof, the Company shall pay,
within three business days of such termination, the sum of Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000) in same day, readily available funds (the " _
_Termination Fee__ ") to Parent.   

Article IX    

Survival; Indemnification    

9.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Notwithstanding any
investigation made by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto or the
results of any such investigation and notwithstanding the participation of
such party in the Closing, the representations and warranties contained in
Article I, Article II, Article III and Article IV hereof shall, except as
provided below, survive the Closing for a period of 15 months from the
Closing Date; _provided, however,_ that if a party shall have made a claim
for indemnification with respect to any specific representation(s) or
warranty(ies) hereunder prior to the 15-month anniversary of the Closing
Date and such claim has not been completely and finally resolved prior to
such anniversary, then such claim shall survive and continue to be fully
actionable until such time as it is completely and finally resolved as if the
specific representation(s) or warranty(ies) upon which it is based had not
yet expired. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.3, 3.12 and 3.14 shall survive the Closing
for a period of three years from the Closing Date, _provided, however,_ that,
with respect to any specific representation or warranty set forth in Sections
3.3, 3.12 or 3.14, if a party shall have made a claim for indemnification
with respect to any specific representation(s) or warranty(ies) hereunder
prior to the three-year anniversary of the Closing Date and such claim has
not been completely and finally resolved prior to such anniversary, then such
claim shall survive and continue to be fully actionable until such time as it
is completely and finally resolved as if the specific representation(s) or
warranty(ies) upon which it is based had not yet expired. This Section 9.1
shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties that by its terms
contemplates performance after Closing.   

9.2 _Indemnification by Stockholders_.   

(a) Subject to the limitations of Section 9.2(b) hereof, holders of Company
Capital Stock and Qualified Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall indemnify in full Parent, the Company and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, shareholders, stockholders and subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _ _Parent Indemnified Parties__ ") and hold them harmless
from and against any claim, demand, loss, liability, obligation, deficiency,
action, damage, expense or cost (including reasonable legal expenses),
whether or not actually incurred or paid (collectively " _ _Losses__ "),
which the Parent Indemnified Parties suffer, sustain or become subject to as
a result of (i) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach of any of
the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
or in the Disclosure Schedule or closing certificates delivered or to be
delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (collectively, the " _ _Related Documents__ "), (ii) any breach of,
or failure to perform, any covenant of the Company contained in this
Agreement or any of the Related Documents, (iii) all Taxes of the Company and
the Tax Affiliates for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date (determined with
respect to periodic Taxes not based on income or receipts (e.g. property
taxes) based on the proportional number of days in the relevant period and
with respect to income Taxes based on a closing of the books) for any taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, (iv) any
Claims (as defined in Section 9.5(a) hereof) or threatened Claims against any
Parent Indemnified Party arising out of the actions or inactions of the
Company with respect to the Companys business or the Real Property prior to
the Closing Date, (v) the failure of the Company to obtain, prior to
the Effective Time, the consent of any holder of a Company Option or a
Company Warrant to the treatment of such Company Option or Company Warrant as
contemplated by Section 2.4 of this Agreement, (vi) any matter described
under the heading "Specific Patent Issues" in Section 3.14(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule which is specifically identified as covered by this
Section 9.2(a)(vi) or (vii) the matters described on _Schedule 7._ _2(l)_
hereto (collectively, the " _ _Parent Losses__ "),  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any indemnification for Parent Losses for matters described in
Sections 9.2(a)(v)-(vii) hereof shall be subject to the same provisions and
conditions of this Article IX as if such matters were brought under Section
9.2(a)(i) hereof; _provided, further_ that Parent Losses shall not include
any amount for "punitive", "consequential" or "special damages" or damages
for "lost profits" except to the extent that (x) a Claim alleges such forms
of damages, (y) a Parent Indemnified Party is deemed responsible therefor
pursuant to such Claim and (z) the responsible Parent Indemnified Party
incurs Losses as a result thereof. The calculation of any such Parent Loss
will reflect (A) the amount of any Tax benefit actually recognized by the
Parent Indemnified Parties for the United States federal and state income Tax
purposes in the year in which such Parent Loss is suffered or incurred and
which is determined by the applicably Parent Indemnified Partys Tax Return
preparers to be without material risk of being disallowed upon audit and (B)
the amount of any insurance proceeds received by the Parent Indemnified Party
in respect of such Parent Loss. For purposes of (A) above, a Tax benefit is
"actually realized" if it can be utilized to reduce such Parent Indemnified
Partys Tax liability with respect to the Tax year in which the Parent loss
is suffered or incurred, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the mere incurring
or increase in a capital or net operating loss or similar Tax asset, without
a resulting reduction in Tax in that year, will not be deemed a Tax benefit
for purposes of this provisions. The indemnification provided by this Section
9.2(a) shall be satisfied solely from the Escrow Amount.   

(b) Holders of Company Capital Stock and Qualified Warrants immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be liable to the Parent Indemnified Parties for
Parent Losses resulting from an inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach
of any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement or in the Related Documents or from the matters described
in Sections 9.2(a)(v)-(vii) hereof (i) only if Parent delivers to
Stockholders Representative a written notice, pursuant to Sections 9.4 and
9.5 hereof, as applicable, with respect to such Parent Indemnified Partys
Claim to be indemnified for such Parent Losses prior to 15 months after
the Closing Date (or, in the case of Parent Losses attributable to (A) an
inaccuracy or misrepresentation in breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 3.3, 3.12 or 3.14 or (B) the matters
described in Sections 9.2(a)(v)-(vii) hereof, prior to three years after the
Closing Date), and (ii) only if the aggregate amount of all such Parent Losses
exceeds $775,000 (the " _ _Basket Amount__ "), in which case such holders
shall be obligated to indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties for the aggregate
amount of all Parent Losses, _provided_ , _however_ , that no Parent
Indemnified Party shall make any claim for Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(a)
hereof which individually does not exceed $15,000, and such claims not
meeting this threshold shall not be applied in calculating the Basket Amount
specified above, _further provided, however_ , that the Basket Amount shall
not apply to (X) breaches, inaccuracies or misrepresentations
of representations and warranties set forth in any of Sections 3.3 and 3.12
hereof or (Y) the matters described in Sections 9.2(a)(v)-(vii) hereof.
Except for fraud in connection with any breach or misrepresentation by the
Company, (i) the aggregate liability of all holders of Company Capital Stock
and Qualified Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time for Parent
Losses resulting from inaccuracies or misrepresentations in or breaches of
any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement or from the matters described in Sections 9.2(a)(v)-(vii) hereof
shall not exceed an amount equal to the Escrow Amount (the " _ _Cap__ ") and
(ii) the aggregate liability of each holder of Company Capital Stock
and Qualified Warrants for such Parent Losses shall not exceed the amount
contributed to the Escrow Amount by Parent on behalf of such holder;
_provided, however_ , that nothing in clause (ii) of this sentence shall be
construed as limiting in any manner the availability of the Escrow Amount
to satisfy the indemnification obligations of the holders of Company Capital
Stock and Qualified Warrants to Parent under this Article IX.   

9.3 _Indemnification by Parent_.   

(a) Subject to the limitations of Section 9.3(b) hereof, Parent agrees to
indemnify in full holders of Company Capital Stock, Qualified Options and
Qualified Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
subsidiaries (collectively, the " _ _Holder Indemnified Parties__ ") and hold
them harmless from and against any Losses which any of the Holder Indemnified
Parties may suffer, sustain or become subject to, arising from or relating to
(i) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach of any of
the representations and warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement or
other Related Documents or (ii) any breach of, or failure to perform, any
covenant of Parent contained in this Agreement (collectively, the " _ _Holder
Losses__ ") _provided_ , _however_ , that Holder Losses shall not include any
amount for "punitive", "consequential" or "special damages" or damages for
"lost profits" except to the extent that (x) a Claim alleges such forms of
damages, (y) a Holder Indemnified Party is deemed responsible therefor
pursuant to such Claim and (z) the responsible Holder Indemnified Party
incurs Losses as a result thereof. The calculation of any such Holder Loss
will reflect (A) the amount of any Tax benefit actually recognized by the
Holder Indemnified Parties for the United States federal and state income Tax
purposes in the year in which such Holder Loss is suffered or incurred and
which is determined by the applicably Holder Indemnified Partys Tax Return
preparers to be without material risk of being disallowed upon audit and (B)
the amount of any insurance proceeds received by the Holder Indemnified Party
in respect of such Holder Loss. For purposes of (A) above, a Tax benefit is
"actually realized" if it can be utilized to reduce such Holder Indemnified
Partys Tax liability with respect to the Tax year in which the Holder
Loss is suffered or incurred, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the mere
incurring or increase in a capital or net operating loss or similar Tax
asset, without a resulting reduction in Tax in that year, will not be deemed
a Tax benefit for purposes of this provisions.   

(b) Parent will be liable to the Holder Indemnified Parties for Holder Losses
from an inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach of any of the
representations and warranties of the Parent contained in this Agreement or
in the Related Documents (i) only if Stockholders Representative delivers to
Parent a written notice, pursuant to Section 9.4 or 9.5 hereof,
as applicable, with respect to such Holder Indemnified Partys claim to be
indemnified for such Holder Losses prior to 15 months after the Closing Date,
and (ii) only if the aggregate amount of all such Holder Losses exceeds the
Basket Amount, in which case Parent shall be obligated to indemnify
the Holder Indemnified Parties for the aggregate amount of all Holder Losses,
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Holder Indemnified Party shall make any
claim for Losses pursuant to Section 9.3(a) hereof which individually does
not exceed $15,000, and such claims not meeting this threshold shall not
be applied in calculating the Basket Amount specified above. Except for fraud
in connection with any breach or misrepresentation by Parent, Parents
aggregate liability for Holder Losses resulting from inaccuracies or
misrepresentations in or breaches of any of the representations and
warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement shall not exceed the
Cap.   

9.4 _Notice of Claims_. Any written notice required to be delivered to the
applicable Indemnifying Party under Section 9.2 or 9.3 hereof, as the case
may be, shall specify in reasonable detail (i) the representation and
warranty or covenant that is alleged to have been inaccurate or to have been
breached, (ii) the basis for such allegation and (iii) if known, the aggregate
amount of the Losses for which a claim is being made under this Article IX
or, to the extent that such Losses are not known or have not been incurred at
the time such claim is made, an estimate, to be prepared in good faith, of
the aggregate potential amount of such Losses. Written notice to
such Indemnifying Party of the existence of a claim shall be given by the
Indemnified Party promptly after the Indemnified Party first receives notice
of the potential claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party
shall not be foreclosed from seeking indemnification pursuant to this
Article IX by any failure to provide such prompt notice of the existence of a
claim to the applicable Indemnifying Party or to supply such relevant
supporting documentation, except and only to the extent that such
Indemnifying Party has been materially damaged or prejudiced as a result of
such delay.   

9.5 _Method of Asserting Claims_. As used herein, an " _ _Indemnified Party__
" shall refer to a Parent Indemnified Party or Holder Indemnified Party, as
applicable, and the " _ _Indemnifying Party__ " shall refer to the party or
parties hereto obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party.   

(a) In the event that any Indemnified Party is made a defendant in or party to
any action or proceeding, judicial or administrative, instituted by any third
party for the liability or the costs or expenses of which are Losses (any
such third party action or proceeding being referred to as a " _ _Claim__ "),
the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
notice thereof. The failure to give such notice shall not affect any
Indemnified Partys ability to seek reimbursement unless such failure has
materially damaged or prejudiced the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
successfully a Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to contest
and defend such Claim; _provided_ , _that_ the Indemnifying Party (i) has a
reasonable basis for concluding that such defense may be successful and (ii)
can diligently contest and defend such Claim. Notice of the intention to so
contest and defend shall be given by the Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party within 20 business days after the Indemnified Partys
notice of such Claim (but, in all events, at least five business days prior
to the date that an answer to such Claim is due to be filed). Such contest
and defense shall be conducted by reputable attorneys retained by
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled at any time,
at its own cost and expense (which expense shall not constitute a Loss unless
the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the Indemnifying Party is
not adequately representing or, because of a conflict of interest, may not
adequately represent, any interests of any Indemnified Party, and only to
the extent that such expenses are reasonable), to participate in such contest
and defense and to be represented by reputable attorneys of its or their own
choosing. If the Indemnified Party elects to participate in such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party to the extent
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the contest and defense of
such Claim, including providing reasonable access (upon reasonable notice) to
the books, records and employees of the Indemnified Party if relevant to the
defense of such Claim; _provided that_ , such cooperation shall not unduly
disrupt the operations of the business of the Indemnified Party or cause the
Indemnified Party to waive any statutory or common law privileges, breach
any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties or otherwise cause any
trade secret or confidential information of such Indemnified Party to become
public. Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party may concede,
settle or compromise any Claim without the consent of the other party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) if a Claim seeks the issue of an injunction, the specific election of an
obligation or similar remedy, or (ii) if the subject matter of a Claim
relates to the ongoing business of any of the Indemnified Parties, which
Claim, if decided against any of the Indemnified Parties, would materially
adversely affect the ongoing business or reputation of any of the Indemnified
Parties, then, in each such case, the Indemnified Parties alone shall be
entitled to contest, defend and settle such Claim in the first instance and,
if the Indemnified Parties do not contest, defend or settle such Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall then have the right to contest and defend (but
not settle) such Claim.   

(b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against the
Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver a notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying
Party or, if holders of the Company Capital Stock and Qualified Warrants
immediately prior to the Effective Time are the Indemnifying Party, to
the Stockholders Representative. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party does not dispute the claim
described in such notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party in writing
within 20 business days after delivery of such notice by the Indemnified
Party whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such
notice, the Loss in the amount specified in the Indemnified Partys notice
will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay (subject to the Basket Amount, to the extent
applicable), the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand.
If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to
such claim, Stockholders Representative and an authorized officer of Parent
will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if
not resolved through the negotiations of such individuals within 20 business
days after the delivery of the Indemnifying Partys notice that it disputes
such claim, such dispute shall be resolved fully and finally in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, by an arbitrator selected pursuant to and an arbitration governed
by Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as
modified herein. The parties will jointly appoint a mutually acceptable
independent arbitrator, seeking assistance in such regard from the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall resolve the dispute based on
the governing law, without regard to its rules of evidence, and judgment upon
the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Each of Parent, on the one hand, and
Stockholders Representative, on the other, shall bear its own fees and
expenses in connection with such arbitration and shall bear 50% of the fees
and expenses of the arbitrator. Stockholders Representative shall be
entitled to deduct the amount of its fees and expenses incurred in connection
with pursuing or defending Claims pursuant to this Article IX from the income
received in respect of the Escrow Fund.   

9.6 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, the rights set forth in
this Article IX shall be each partys sole and exclusive remedies against the
other parties hereto for misrepresentations, inaccuracies or breaches of
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the Related
Documents or for the matters described in Sections 9.2(a)(v)-(vii) hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent any of the parties
hereto from bringing an action based upon allegations of fraud in connection
with this Agreement and the Related Documents. In the event such action is
brought, Parent, on the one hand, and Stockholders Representative, on the
other, shall each bear its own fees and expenses in connection with
such action.   

9.7 _Stockholders  Representative_.   

(a) Robert R. Ackerman, Jr. (the " _ _Stockholders  Representative__") shall
act as the representative of holders of Company Capital Stock, Qualified
Options and Qualified Warrants and shall be authorized to take any action and
to make and deliver any certificate, notice, consent or instrument required
or permitted to be made or delivered under this Agreement or under
the documents referred to in this Agreement by such Persons, to waive any
requirements of this Agreement or to enter into one or more amendments or
supplements to this Agreement that Stockholders Representative determines in
Stockholders Representatives sole and absolute discretion to be necessary,
appropriate or advisable, which authority includes the execution and delivery
of the Escrow Agreement and any amendments or supplements thereto and the
performance of all obligations thereunder, including authority to collect and
pay funds and dispute, settle, compromise and make all claims. The authority
of Stockholders Representative includes the right to hire or retain, at the
sole expense of the holders of Company Capital Stock, Qualified Options and
Qualified Warrants, such counsel, investment bankers, accountants,
representatives and other professional advisors as Stockholders
Representative determines in Stockholders Representative sole and absolute
discretion to be necessary, appropriate or advisable in order to perform
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Stockholders Representative shall not have the authority to amend, on behalf
of Company Capital Stock, Qualified Options and Qualified Warrants, (i) the
terms of Article II of this Agreement or (ii) any obligation of Company
Capital Stock, Qualified Options and Qualified Warrants under this
Agreement in a manner that expands such obligation. Any party will have the
right to rely upon any action taken by Stockholders Representative in
accordance with the powers set forth above, and to act in accordance with
such action without independent investigation.   

(b) Parent will have no liability to any holder of Company Capital Stock,
Company Options or Company Warrants or otherwise, in each case arising out of
the acts or omissions of Stockholders Representative, any disputes among
holders of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants or with
Stockholders Representative, or, provided that Parent shall have fulfilled
its obligations under Sections 2.2(a) and 2.4, the consents described in
Sections 7.2(d), 7.2(f), or 7.2(g) hereof. Parent may rely entirely on its
dealings with, and notices to and from, Stockholders Representative and the
Company (with copies to the Persons set forth in Section 10.4 hereof) to
satisfy any obligations it might have under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or any other agreement referred to in this Agreement.   

Article X    

Miscellaneous    

10.1 _Press Releases and Announcements_. Except as otherwise required by law
or the rules of any applicable securities exchange, so long as this Agreement
is in effect, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will not, and will not
permit any of their respective affiliates or representatives to, issue or
cause the publication of any press release or make any other
public announcement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will cooperate with each other in the development and distribution
of all press releases and other public announcements with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and will furnish the
others with drafts of any such releases and announcements as far in advance
as possible.   

10.2 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein, the
Company on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, will each pay all

contemplated hereunder, including legal, accounting, investment banking and
consulting fees and expenses incurred in negotiating, executing and delivering
this Agreement and the Related Documents (whether the transactions
contemplated hereunder are consummated or not). The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent, on the other, will each bear 50% of the expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation and filing of any filings required by the HSR
Act and any other comparable foreign merger or competition laws which are
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement..   

10.3 _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended or waived
except in a writing executed by the party against which such amendment or
waiver is sought to be enforced. No course of dealing between or among any
Persons having any interest in this Agreement will be deemed effective to
modify or amend any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any
Person under or by reason of this Agreement.   

10.4 _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement will be in

10.5 _Interpretation_. The language used in this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be the language chosen by
the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. The table of contents and
headings of articles and sections herein are for convenience of reference, do
not constitute a part of this Agreement, and shall not be deemed to limit or
affect any of the provisions hereof. For all purposes of and under this
Agreement, the words " _include_ ", " _includes_ " and " _including_ " when
used herein, shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "
_without limitation_." As used in this Agreement, " _ _Person__ " means any
individual, corporation, limited liability company, limited or general
partnership, joint venture, association, joint stock company, trust,
unincorporated organization or other entity; " _knowledge_ " means the actual
knowledge of Ian Sugarbroad, John Niedermaier, Michael Frausing, Daniel
Weinblatt and Melissa Madriaga, as such knowledge has been obtained in the
normal conduct of the business and including such knowledge as a reasonably
prudent Person in such position would have obtained upon the exercise of
reasonable diligence (except that the representation of the Company contained
in Section 3.14(d)(iii) shall be qualified by the actual knowledge of Persons
referred to in such representation); " _affiliate_ " has the meaning assigned
to it in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and all
amounts shall be deemed to be stated in U.S. dollars, unless specifically
indicated otherwise.   

10.6 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer
any rights upon any Person or entity that is not a party or permitted
assignee of a party to this Agreement,  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
holders of Company Capital Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants (as to
payments to be made to them pursuant to Article II hereof only), and (ii)
the officers and directors of the Company (as to Section 6.8 herein only) are
each intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.   

10.7 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.   

10.8 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits and
the Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto or
contemplated hereby) contain the complete agreement between the parties and
supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or
between the parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject
matter hereof in any way, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which will
continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.   

10.9 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Disclosure Schedule contains a series of
schedules corresponding to the Sections contained in Article III. Each item
so disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule shall constitute an exception to the
representations and warranties to which it makes reference and shall be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to each section of the
Disclosure Schedule to which it relates and/or representation and warranty
herein given, without the necessity of repetitive disclosure or cross-
reference, so long as such item is fairly described with reasonable
particularity and detail and such description provides a reasonable indication
that the item applies to another schedule contained in the Disclosure
Schedule.   

10.10 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto.   

10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and
the same instrument. A facsimile signature will be considered an original
signature.   

10.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.   

10.13 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of parties irrevocably agrees that
any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the
other party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined
