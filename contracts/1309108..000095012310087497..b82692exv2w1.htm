Affiliate (or either) on any insurance policy maintained with any member of
the Retained Group.  
      
    | 4.2.5  |   | In such circumstances referred to in clause 4.2.3,
the Seller must make all necessary claims or permit the Buyer or a Target
Company or T/G Affiliate to make all necessary claims under the relevant
Sellers Group Insurance Policy and the Buyer (or such member of the Buyer
Group or T/G Affiliate as the Buyer may nominate) will be entitled to be paid
any proceeds actually received under the Seller Group Insurance Policy (after
taking into account any deductible and less any tax suffered on the proceeds
and any reasonable out of pocket expenses suffered or incurred by any members
of the Retained Group):

---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | the Buyer or any member of the Buyer Group will
not be entitled to any proceeds received by any member of the Retained Group
under any Seller Group Insurance Policy to the extent that those proceeds
relate to a claim in respect of a matter other than the carrying on of the
Businesses on or prior to Completion or any loss or liability incurred by a
Target Group Company and any T/G Affiliate (or either) on or prior to
Completion;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | subject to clause 4.2.6 nothing in this clause 4.2
shall prevent any member of the Retained Group from making any claim and
receiving the proceeds under any Seller Group Insurance Policy to the extent
that it relates to a loss suffered or incurred by such member; and  
   

  

       | (b)  |   | subject always to the Buyer:

Affiliates) to procure that the relevant members of the Retained Group and
R/G Affiliates will provide to the Buyer and the Target Group Companies and

reasonably requested by the Buyer, Target Group Companies and T/G Affiliates
(and the insurers of the Seller Group Insurance Policies, appointed claims
handlers or any solicitors instructed by them) in order that any claim upon

as appropriate;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | all such information reasonably required by the Buyer
and its professional advisers to obtain insurances in respect of each of

or fail to act in any way so as to procure preference for any claim
for indemnity by the Retained Group and R/G Affiliates (or either) upon
such insurance policies over the Target Group Companies and T/G Affiliates
(or either).  
   

  

     4.3  |   | Access

    |   | From the date of this agreement until Completion the Seller
must use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that each Target Group Company

including the monthly board packs of the Target Group.  
      
  4.4  |   | Co-operation

that the Buyer is entitled to seek an injunction from a court of competent
jurisdiction if:  
   

  

       | 17.5.1  |   | it fails to comply or threatens to fail to
comply with clause 17.1; or

     3.  |   | As between the Seller and the Buyer, any payments which
the Seller is required to make pursuant to paragraphs 1 and/or 2 (and the
Sellers obligations in respect thereof) and any payments which the Buyer is
required to make pursuant to paragraphs 1 and/or 2 (and the Buyers
obligations in respect thereof) shall be netted off against each other and
satisfied and discharged by a single payment of one net sum by the relevant
party to the other or, if the net amount is zero, such netting off shall

and the Buyers obligations in respect thereof).

amount instead to the Seller (which will have paid that amount on behalf of
and as agent for that member of the Retained Group to the Buyer, which will
have received that amount on behalf of and as agent for that member of the
Target Group) and, correspondingly, the Buyer shall owe that amount to the
member of the Target Group on whose behalf of the Buyer received such amount;

    | 5.2  |   | each member of the Target Group which owed to a member

to the Buyer (which will have paid that amount on behalf of and as agent for
that member of the Target Group to the Seller, which will have received that
amount on behalf of and as agent for that member of the Retained Group) and,
correspondingly, the Seller shall owe that amount to the member of the
Retained Group on whose behalf the Seller received such amount.  
   

  

     6.  |   | If any sum due and payable under this Part F of this
Schedule is not paid on the due date for payment such sum shall carry
interest at a rate equal to the business options prime lending rate published

points from the due date until the date of actual payment (whether before or
after judgment).  
---|---|--- 
      
  7.  |   | All amounts payable pursuant to this Part F of this Schedule
