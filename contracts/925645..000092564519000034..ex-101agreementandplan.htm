2.3, each share of the Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
(each such share, a "Common Share"), issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled and cease to exist automatically and
shall be converted into the right to receive, with respect to each Common
Share, an amount equal to $4.58 in cash, without interest (the "Common Share
Consideration").

(b) Conversion of Company Preferred Stock. Subject to Section 2.1(c) and
Section 2.3, each share of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock and Series B

Preferred Shares shall be canceled and cease to exist automatically and no

delivered in exchange therefor.







6

value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
ordinary share of the Surviving Company and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares in the share capital of the Surviving Company. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing Merger Sub Common
Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of ordinary
shares of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence.

adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split (share
subdivision), reverse stock split (consolidation), stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Capital Stock),
cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Capital
Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time;
provided, that nothing in this Section 2.1(e) shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

(f) Effect on Shares. From and after the Effective Time, all Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a Share shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration
therefor in accordance with this Section 2.1 upon the surrender of such Share
in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest thereon.

 Section 2.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent or Merger Sub shall designate a
reputable international bank or trust company, which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to act as the payment agent in connection with the
Merger (the "Paying Agent"). On the Closing Date, Parent or Merger Sub shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent an amount in cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration with respect to Shares
entitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1 (the "Exchange Fund"). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.1, Parent shall,
or shall cause Merger Sub to, as promptly as reasonably practicable deposit
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such
cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or
short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the
U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates or Book‑Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Company on the earlier of one year after the Effective Time or full
payment of the Exchange Fund.

(b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than three business days after the Effective Time),
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause the Paying Agent
to mail or otherwise provide (i) to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") whose Shares were converted pursuant
to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (x) a letter
of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify and (y) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates) in exchange for payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration and (ii) to each holder of non-certificated
Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") whose Shares were
converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger. Upon surrender of
a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of Certificates) for
cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents







8

 reasonably acceptable to the Company as may be appointed by Parent or the
Surviving Company, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, and without any
action by any holder of record of any Book-Entry Share, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the applicable Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed or otherwise
provided as promptly as practicable following the later to occur of (A) the
Effective Time and (B) with respect to the holders of Certificates, the Paying
Agent's receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of such
Certificate), and such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of such
Certificate) or Book-Entry Share shall be forthwith canceled. The Paying Agent
shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates)
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (1) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and (2) the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Company that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be
paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares
shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. Until satisfaction of the applicable procedures contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Article II,
without interest thereon.

(c) Share Registers; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the share registers of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and, subject to
compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b), exchanged as provided in
this Agreement, without any interest thereon.







9

 (d) Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability. At any time beginning on the
date that is 12 months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund
that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject
only to the Paying Agent's routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
Section 2.2(b), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Company, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Company, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon (i) the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and (ii) compliance with
the other procedures set forth in this Article II, the applicable Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1; provided
that the Surviving Company may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Company or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.







10

 Section 2.3 Dissenting Shares.

(a) At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and cease
to exist automatically and, unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
converted into the right to receive the Common Share Consideration for each
such Common Share pursuant to Section 2.1, and any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall, in the event that the fair value of a Dissenting Share as appraised by
the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section 106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act
(the "Appraised Fair Value") is greater than the applicable Common Share
Consideration, be entitled to receive such difference from the Surviving
Company by payment made within one month after such Appraised Fair Value is
finally determined pursuant to such appraisal procedure. In the event that a
holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or
otherwise waives any right to appraisal under Section 106(6) of the Bermuda
Companies Act (each, an "Appraisal Withdrawal"), such holder's Dissenting
Shares shall be canceled as of the Effective Time and converted into the right
to receive the Common Share Consideration for each such Dissenting Share.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of (A) any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any Dissenting Shares, of any
Appraisal Withdrawals and of any other written instruments, notices, petitions
or other communications received by the Company in connection with the
foregoing, in each case, pursuant to the provisions of the Bermuda Companies
Act concerning the rights of holders of Common Shares to require appraisal of
such Common Shares in accordance with this Section 2.3 and (B) to the extent
that the Company has knowledge thereof, any applications to the Supreme Court
of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and (ii)
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with
the Company in any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
demands for appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, settle
or compromise or offer to settle or compromise or otherwise negotiate any such
demands, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal
or any failure to timely take any other action to exercise appraisal rights in
accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act, or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Payment of any amount payable to holders of Dissenting Shares shall
be the obligation of the Surviving Company.







11

 Section 2.4 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding, unvested
and unexercised option to purchase Common Shares (the "Company Options") under
any Company Equity Plan shall become immediately vested and exercisable in
full and (ii) each Company Option that remains outstanding and unexercised as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including each Company Option that
becomes vested and exercisable pursuant to clause (i)) shall be canceled and,
in exchange therefor, each holder of any such canceled Company Option shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancelation of such Company
Option and in settlement thereof, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the
product of (A) the total number of Common Shares for which such Company Option
remains outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (B) the excess, if any, of the Common Share Consideration over the
exercise price per Common Share previously subject to such Company Option
(such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Option Consideration").
From and after the Effective Time, any such canceled Company Option shall no
longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle
such holder to the payment of the Option Consideration.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all outstanding restricted stock
units (the "Company RSUs") under any Company Equity Plan shall become
immediately vested and all restrictions thereupon shall lapse, and such
Company RSUs shall be canceled in exchange for the right to receive, with
respect to each Common Share for which such Company RSU remains outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Common Share Consideration. With
respect to any Company RSU that has performance-based vesting conditions, the
number of Common Shares subject to such Company RSU when such Company RSU
vests and performance restrictions thereon lapse in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence shall be determined in accordance with the
corresponding award agreement.

(c) The Company shall take appropriate corporate actions to effectuate the
treatment of the Company Options and Company RSUs (collectively, the "Company
Equity Awards") as contemplated by this Section 2.4.

(d) After the Effective Time on the Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to the Surviving Company all funds necessary to fulfill
the obligations set forth in this Section 2.4. After the Effective Time on the
Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall pay the Option Consideration payable
in respect of Company Options under Section 2.4(a) and the Common Share
Consideration payable in respect of Company RSUs under Section 2.4(b), in each
case after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
Section 2.5.







12

 Section 2.5 Additional Payment Matters; Withholding. All amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.4 shall be paid without interest (unless otherwise
noted). Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving
Company (and any agent thereof) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, and
any payments made pursuant to this Article II shall be net of, all applicable
withholding taxes that the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Company (or any agent thereof), as the case may be, shall be required to
deduct and withhold under applicable Law with respect to such payments.
Amounts so deducted and withheld by the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Company and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of a payment to which such deduction and withholding was
made.

each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or present conduct of its
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

Agreement, correct and complete copies of any amendments to the Company
Governing Documents not filed as of the date hereof with the SEC, and each of

organization and has the requisite corporate or other entity power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which
recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or
present conduct of its business makes such qualification or licensing

or licensed or to be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The

investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any
Company Subsidiary or any other Person. There are no outstanding obligations
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party (i) restricting the

legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate or other
power, as the case may be, and authority to conduct its business as now being
conducted, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so

Merger Sub, as the case may be, to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate or other entity power and

terms, except that the enforcement hereof may be limited by the Enforceability

writ, injunction, decree or Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub, any of
their Subsidiaries, or any of their properties or assets; except in each of
clauses (b), (c) or (d) where (1) any failure to obtain such permits,
authorizations, consents or approvals, (2) any failure to make such filings or
(3) any such modifications, violations, rights, breaches or defaults would
not, individually or in the aggregate, impair or delay in any material respect
the ability of each Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, as the case may be, or prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the Transactions.

Section 4.4 Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no Legal Proceeding

threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and none of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction,
decree or arbitration ruling or judgment of a Governmental Entity, in each
case, which would, individually or in the aggregate, impair or delay in any
material respect the ability of each of Parent and Merger Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, as the case may be, or prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Transactions.







41

 Section 4.5 Information in the Proxy Statement. None of the information
supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any affiliate or Representative of Parent or
Merger Sub, expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will, on the date
of filing with the SEC, at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed and at
the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied by any other Person that is included in the Proxy
Statement.

Section 4.6 Ownership of Company Capital Stock. None of the Guarantor, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries beneficially owns (within
the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder), or will prior to the Closing Date beneficially own,
any Shares, or is a party, or will prior to the Closing Date become a party,
to any contract, other arrangement or understanding (whether written or oral)
(other than this Agreement and the Voting Agreement) for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any Shares.

Section 4.7 Sufficient Funds.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
(i) the executed Debt Financing Documents, pursuant to which, and subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, the lender parties thereto have agreed to
lend the amounts set forth therein to Merger Sub for the purpose of funding
the Transactions (the "Debt Financing") and (ii) the executed Equity
Commitment Letter from a certain person (the "Equity Investor") relating to
the commitment of the Equity Investor to provide cash equity in the aggregate
amount set forth therein for the purpose of funding the Transactions (the
"Equity Financing" and, together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing").
The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide until such
time as this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter is terminated, that the
Company is a third party beneficiary thereof as set forth therein.







42

 (b) As of the date hereof: (i) each of the Financing Documents is in full
force and effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect; (ii)
each of the Financing Documents is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Merger Sub and Parent, and (in the case of the Debt Financing Documents only,
to the knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent) the other parties thereto; (iii)
each of the Debt Financing Documents delivered to the Company is a correct and
complete copy (as amended through the date hereof), except that certain
portions of the Debt Financing Documents have been redacted with respect to
certain fees and similar arrangements which do not affect the amount,
availability or conditionality of the Debt Financing; (iv) except for the
Financing Documents delivered to the Company, there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements that could affect the amount,
availability or conditionality of the Financing, to which Merger Sub, Parent,
or any of their respective affiliates is a party and (v) assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions to Merger Sub's and Parent's obligation to
consummate the Merger, to the knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to (A) constitute a default or breach on the part of
Merger Sub, Parent or their respective affiliates (solely with respect to the
Equity Financing), and, in the case of the Debt Financing Documents only, to
the knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent, any of the other parties thereto,
under any term of the Financing Documents, (B) result in a failure of any
condition of the Financing Documents or (C) result in any portion of the
Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. Merger Sub and Parent have
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by
the Financing Documents to be paid on or before the date hereof. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's obligation to consummate the
Merger, the aggregate net proceeds of the Financing will be sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Merger Sub's and Parent's obligations under this
Agreement, including the payment in cash of the aggregate Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1 and all amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.4,
the payment of all amounts required to satisfy Parent's obligations pursuant
to Section 6.12 and as described in Schedule 6.12 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the payment of all associated reasonable costs and Expenses (including
the Expenses payable by Parent pursuant to Section 9.3) and the payment of all
other amounts required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with
the consummation of the Transactions. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the
full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Documents. As of the date hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions to Merger Sub's and Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger,
neither Merger Sub nor Parent has any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount of
the Financing will not be available to Merger Sub on the date of the Closing.







43

 (c) Neither Merger Sub nor Parent is a party to any contract or arrangement
which expressly limits or restricts the ability of any Person to provide debt
financing for other potential purchasers of the Company.

(d) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to
the Company the limited guarantee of the Equity Investor with respect to
certain matters on the terms specified therein (the "Guarantee" and, such
Equity Investor as a signatory to the Guarantee, the "Guarantor"). The
Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Equity Investor, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, and has not been amended,
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. No event has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of, or a default under, the
Guarantee on the part of the Equity Investor. Each of Merger Sub and Parent,
and, to the knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent, the Equity Investor, has
complied and is in compliance in all material respects with applicable anti-
money laundering Laws.

Section 4.8 Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub. Parent owns beneficially
and of record all of the outstanding share capital of Merger Sub. Merger Sub
was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has engaged
in no other business activities, has conducted its operations only as
contemplated hereby, and has not incurred any liabilities or other obligations
(other than to the Company pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions).

Section 4.9 Brokers and Other Advisors. Other than J.P. Morgan Securities plc
(the fees and expenses of which shall be paid by Parent), no broker,
investment banker, financial advisor, agent or other Person is entitled to any
broker's, finder's, financial advisor's, agent's or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries.

Section 4.10 No Agreements with Shareholders. Other than the Voting Agreement,
none of the Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or their
respective affiliates has entered into any contract, commitment, agreement,
instrument, obligation, arrangement, understanding or undertaking, whether
written or oral, with any shareholder of the Company (where such shareholder
has entered into such contract, commitment, agreement, instrument, obligation,
arrangement, understanding or undertaking in his or her or its capacity as a
shareholder of the Company), including any "lock up" or similar arrangements
pertaining to the Capital Stock of the Company held by such shareholder.







44

 Section 4.11 No Agreements with Management. Other than this Agreement, as of
the date hereof, there are no contracts, commitments, agreements, instruments,
obligations, arrangements, understandings or undertakings, whether written or
oral, between the Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Representatives, on the one hand, and any member of the
Company's management or the Company Board of Directors, on the other hand,
relating in any way to the Transactions or the operations of the Company after
the Effective Time.







45

 Section 4.12 Solvency. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Sections 7.1 and
7.2 have been satisfied or waived, (b) the Required Information fairly
presents the consolidated financial condition of the Company as at the end of
the periods covered thereby and the consolidated results of earnings of the
Company for the periods covered thereby, (c) the compliance by the Company
with its obligations hereunder and (d) the representations and warranties of
the Company in Article III are accurate, after giving effect to the
Transactions, including the Financing, any alternative financing and the
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, all
amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.4, the payment of all amounts
required to satisfy Parent's obligations pursuant to Section 6.12 and as
described in Schedule 6.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the payment of
all associated reasonable costs and Expenses (including the Expenses payable
by Parent pursuant to Section 9.3) and the payment of all other amounts
required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and to allow Merger Sub and Parent to perform
all of their obligations under this Agreement, the Surviving Company will be
Solvent as of and after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Solvent" means that, as of any date of determination and
with respect to any Person: (a) the fair value of the assets of such Person
and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater than the total
amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of such Person and
its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (b) the present fair saleable value
of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is
not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability
of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on their debts
and liabilities as they become absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are not engaged in business or a
transaction, and are not about to engage in business or a transaction, for
which such Person's and its Subsidiaries' assets, on a consolidated basis,
would constitute unreasonably small capital and (d) such Person and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not intend to, and do not believe
that they will, incur debts or liabilities beyond their ability to pay such
debts and liabilities as they mature; provided that the amount of any
contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in
light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents
the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
liability (irrespective of whether such contingent liabilities meet the
criteria for accrual under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 5).







46

 Section 4.13 Investigation; Limitation on Warranties; Disclaimer of Other
Representations and Warranties. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted
its own independent review and analysis of the business, operations, assets,
intellectual property, technology, liabilities, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and acknowledges that each of Parent and Merger Sub has been provided access
to personnel, properties, premises and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for such purposes. In entering into this Agreement, each of
Parent and Merger Sub has relied solely upon its independent investigation and
analysis of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has not been induced by and has not
relied upon, and specifically disclaims reliance upon, any representations,
warranties or statements, whether express or implied, made by the Company, any
Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates, shareholders,
controlling persons or Representatives that are not expressly set forth in
this Agreement, whether or not such representations, warranties or statements
were made in writing or orally. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and
agree that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth
in Article III, (a) the Company does not make, or has not made, any

its or their respective businesses or otherwise in connection with the Merger
and Parent and Merger Sub are not relying on, and specifically disclaim
reliance upon, any representation or warranty except for those expressly set
forth in Article III, (b) no Person has been authorized by the Company to make
any representation or warranty relating to itself, the Company Subsidiaries or
its or their respective businesses or otherwise in connection with the Merger,
and if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent
or Merger Sub as having been authorized by such party and (c) any estimates,
projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda,
presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives are not and shall not be
deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless any such
materials or information is the subject of any express representation or
warranty set forth in Article III.

good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and upon the
recommendation thereof by the Special Committee) that the failure to so waive,
amend or modify such confidentiality or standstill agreement would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the Company
promptly (and in any event no later than one business day thereafter) notifies
Parent thereof after taking such action. The Company agrees and acknowledges
that any violation of the restrictions contained in this Section 5.2 by any

Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in
accordance with Section 5.2(c)).







56

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
including the limitations set forth in Section 5.2(b), if at any time prior to
obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval, the Company receives an
unsolicited, bona fide written Competing Proposal after the date hereof that
has not been withdrawn and that did not result from a breach of this Section
5.2, the Company and its Representatives acting on behalf of the Company may

Proposal, the Company and its Representatives acting on behalf of the Company

providing such access, the Company receives from such Person an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person with respect to such Competing Proposal;

determination of the Company Board of Directors made as required above, and
(2) provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the
Company provided to such Person which was not previously provided to Parent or
its Representatives. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48

expected to constitute, result in or lead to a Competing Proposal, notify

Proposal or request, inquiry, offer or proposal, and the identity of the
Person making such Competing Proposal or request, inquiry, offer or proposal.

proposal (including all amendments or proposed amendments, schedules and

writing, a written description of the material terms and conditions of such
Competing Proposal. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to
any information provided to Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives

57

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
including the limitations set forth in Section 5.2(b), at any time prior to
obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval:

(i) the Company Board of Directors may effect a Change of Recommendation or
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h)
(provided, that the Company pays to Parent the applicable Company Termination
Fee when and as provided herein) and enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal if (A) the Company receives a Competing
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2 and has not
been withdrawn and that the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisor and upon the recommendation thereof by the Special
Committee) constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and
upon the recommendation thereof by the Special Committee) that the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
(C) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
five business days in advance (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to
effect such a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal (including the per share value of the consideration offered therein),
and the Company shall have contemporaneously provided to Parent an unredacted
copy of the relevant agreement (including all amendments or proposed
amendments, schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any such Superior
Proposal, (D) prior to effecting such a Change of Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall direct its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor to, during the Notice Period, negotiate
with Parent and its affiliates in good faith (to the extent Parent and its
affiliates also have notified the Company that they so seek to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Financing Documents and the Guarantee, such that such Competing Proposal would
cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (E) taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered in writing by
Parent pursuant to this Section 5.2(d)(i) as described above, the Company
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisor and upon the
recommendation thereof by the Special Committee) that such Competing Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and upon the recommendation thereof by the Special
Committee) that the failure to effect such a Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with







58

 respect to such Superior Proposal would continue to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice and a notice period that is the longer of
two business days or the number of business days remaining in the current
Notice Period); and

(ii) other than in connection with a Competing Proposal, the Company Board of
Directors may effect a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening
Event if (A) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and upon the recommendation thereof by the
Special Committee) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company shall have provided
prior written notice to Parent, at least five business days in advance, of its
intention to effect such a Change of Recommendation, which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the Intervening Event and the reasons for such
Change of Recommendation, (C) prior to effecting such a Change of
Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall cause its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and
its affiliates in good faith (to the extent Parent and its affiliates also
have notified the Company that they so seek to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing
Documents and the Guarantee, such that the failure to make such a Change of
Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would no longer be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors under
applicable Law and (D) taking into account all adjustments to the terms of
this Agreement that may be offered in writing by Parent pursuant to this
Section 5.2(d)(ii) as described above, the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisor and upon the recommendation thereof by the
Special Committee) that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event would continue to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.







59

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof (including
the Special Committee) from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations
under applicable Law with respect to a Competing Proposal, including taking
and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any other similar
communication to shareholders that is required by applicable Law in connection
with the making or amendment of a Competing Proposal), (ii) making any "stop,
look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, which, in any event, shall not be deemed to constitute a Change of
Recommendation or (iii) making any legally required disclosure to its
shareholders regarding this Agreement or a Competing Proposal; provided,
however, that, in any event, the Company Board of Directors shall not effect a
Change of Recommendation except in accordance with Section 5.2(d).

thereof to the shareholders of the Company, and prior to responding to any
comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent
and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and to comment on such
document or response, which the Company shall consider in good faith. The

thereof. If, at any time prior to the Shareholders Meeting, any information
relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
affiliates, this Agreement or the Transactions (including the Merger), should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be prepared by the Company and filed with the SEC, and
to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of
the Company. Subject to Section 5.2(d), the Proxy Statement shall include the
Company Board Recommendation.

later of (a) the tenth day after the preliminary Proxy Statement is filed with
the SEC, if the SEC has not informed the Company that it will review the Proxy
Statement, and (b) confirmation by the SEC that the SEC has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement) take all action required under the Bermuda
Companies Act, the Company Governing Documents and the applicable requirements
of Nasdaq to establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of a
meeting of its shareholders (the "Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as promptly as reasonably
practicable, in each case, notwithstanding that a Change of Recommendation has
been effected or the existence of a Competing Proposal. Unless the Company
Board of Directors shall have effected a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with Section 5.2 or this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with Article VIII, (a) the Company Board of Directors and the
Special Committee shall recommend that the Company's shareholders vote in
favor of the approval of this Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and
the Merger and (b) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
from its shareholders the Requisite Shareholder Approval. The Company agrees
that no matters shall be brought before the Shareholders Meeting other than
adoption of the Merger, this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, any
related "golden parachute" vote under Rule 14a-21(c) of the Exchange Act and
any related and customary procedural matters (including a proposal to adjourn
the meeting to allow additional solicitation of votes).

Section 5.5 Curaçao Restructuring. The Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to, subject to obtaining any applicable third party
consents, approvals or waivers, use reasonable best efforts to (a) cause all
of the issued share capital of CME Media Enterprises B.V. to be held directly

acceptable to Parent. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall (x)
use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain any third party consents,
approvals or waivers necessary to effect the foregoing and (y) keep Parent
reasonably apprised of, and consult with Parent (and consider Parent's good
faith advice), with respect to such transaction and any material decisions
related thereto.

with, and give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested by, the other party in connection with any filings under or
with respect to any applicable Competition Laws or Required Competition
Approvals and any filings, conferences or other submissions related to
resolving any investigation or other inquiry by any applicable Governmental
Entity in connection therewith; and







64

 (ii) (A) make or cause to be made as promptly as reasonably practicable the
applications or filings required to be made under or with respect to any
applicable Communications Laws or Required Communications Approvals in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions, (B) comply at the earliest
reasonably practicable date with any request under or with respect to any
applicable Communications Laws or Required Communications Approvals for
additional information, documents or other materials received by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective affiliates from any Governmental Entity in
connection with such applications or filings or the Transactions and (C)
coordinate and cooperate with, and give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested by, the other party in connection
with any filings under or with respect to any applicable Communications Laws
or Required Communications Approvals and any filings, conferences or other
submissions related to resolving any investigation or other inquiry by any
applicable Governmental Entity in connection therewith.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to Section
6.2(a), but subject in each case to Section 6.2(f), each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub agree to take or cause to be taken the following
actions:

(i) cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to take, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, any and all actions necessary to avoid the
entry of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order,
decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Transactions,
including (A) defending any litigation in any court, agency or other
proceeding by any Person, including any Governmental Entity, seeking to delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Transactions and (B) the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to
sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such
disposition, and promptly effect the sale, lease, license, disposal and
holding separate of, any assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories
of assets or businesses or other operations, or interests therein, of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (and the entry into agreements with, and
submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Entity giving effect
thereto), if such action should be reasonably necessary and advisable to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (1)
commencement of any proceeding in any forum or (2) issuance of any order,
decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or any of the
Transactions by any Governmental Entity;







65

 (ii) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued, or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or
inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger or any of the
Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful, or that
would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the Merger or any of the Transactions, cooperate with each other and use
reasonable best efforts to take, as promptly as reasonably practicable, any
and all steps necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened (in writing)
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so as to permit
such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by
this Agreement; and

(iii) use reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable Law relating to the
exchange of information, to: (A) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing, submission, or oral presentation and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by
a private party; (B) keep the other party and its counsel informed on a
reasonably current basis of any communication received by such party from, or
given by any Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case, regarding any
of the Transactions and (C) permit the other party and its counsel to review
the non-confidential portions of any communication given by it to, and consult
with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the Governmental Entity or other
Person, give the other party and its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences.

(c) The Company shall agree, if requested by Parent, to divest, hold separate
or otherwise take or commit to take any action with respect to the businesses,
services, or assets of the Company in furtherance of Section 6.2(a) and
Section 6.2(b); provided that any such action may be conditioned upon
consummation of the Merger.







66

 (d) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another in good faith to
determine a mutually agreeable list of consents, approvals or waivers required
to be obtained from parties to material Contracts to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions and, following the determination of such list, the Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such consents, approvals or waivers; provided, that the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be required to pay any
consideration or make any concession, commence any litigation or offer or
grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party in
connection with such efforts as set out in this Section 6.2(d) and to the
extent the foregoing shall require any action by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that would, or would continue to, affect the Company or any Company
Subsidiary's business after the Closing Date in any material respect, such
action shall require the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent further agrees
that: (x) under no circumstance shall the Merger Consideration be reduced and
(y) no condition to the Company's obligations to close the Transactions shall
be deemed not satisfied as a result of, in each case, (A) the failure to
obtain any such consent, approval or waiver as to any such material Contract
or (B) any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver, or any default under
or termination of such material Contracts.

(e) If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity challenging any of the
Transactions as in violation of any applicable Law, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including any action or
proceeding that seeks a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction
that would prohibit, prevent or restrict consummation of any of the
Transactions.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as set
forth in Schedule 6.2(f) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates, or direct or indirect
equityholders (including the Guarantor) or their respective affiliates, shall
be required to, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be
permitted to, without Parent's prior written approval (and the "reasonable
best efforts" standard set forth in this Section 6.2 shall not in any event be
construed to require Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates
or direct or indirect equityholders (including the Guarantor) or their
respective affiliates to, or to permit the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates without Parent's prior written
approval to), take or agree or commit to take any action, or agree or commit
to any condition or restriction, necessary to secure the requisite approvals
and authorizations or expiration of waiting periods for the Transactions under
any applicable Law or otherwise to obtain the approval, authorization or







67

 exemption of any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions, that
would (i) require any action by, or would impose any condition or restriction
on, Parent, any of its affiliates or direct or indirect equity holders of
Parent (including the Guarantor) or their respective affiliates or any
investment funds advised or managed by one or more affiliates of Parent or any
direct or indirect portfolio companies thereof or any of their respective
businesses, product lines or assets, (ii) require the Company, Parent, any of
their respective affiliates or direct or indirect equity holders (including
the Guarantor) or their respective affiliates or any investment funds advised
or managed by one or more affiliates of Parent or any direct or indirect
portfolio companies thereof to propose, negotiate, agree, accept, commit to or
effect, by consent decree, hold-separate or administrative order or otherwise,
the sale, transfer, license, divestiture or other disposition of, or any
prohibition or limitation on the ownership, operation or effective control of,
any of their businesses, product lines or assets or (iii) materially and
adversely interfere with Parent's or its affiliates' ability to participate in
the management, effectively control, or exercise of full rights of ownership
of, the Company or materially impair the aggregate economic benefits that
Parent and its affiliates reasonably expect to derive from the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such action, condition or
restriction referred to in clauses (i) through (iii), a "Burdensome
Condition"); provided, however, that any action described in clause (ii) above
required to be taken with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary, as applicable, shall not constitute a Burdensome
Condition. Nothing herein shall require Parent or its affiliates to pursue or
commence any action against any Governmental Entity (other than in defense of
any claim asserted in court or administrative or other tribunal by any Person
(including any Governmental Entity)) in order to prevent the entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed, overturned or terminated, any judgment
enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended or enforced by any Governmental
Entity or any applicable Law that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay
the consummation of the Transactions.

(g) Parent shall vote (or act by written consent with respect to) all of the
shares of the share capital of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it in favor of
the approval of this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement in
accordance with applicable Law.







68

 Section 6.3 Publicity. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
(and shall not cause or permit their respective Subsidiaries and
Representatives to) issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other announcement relating to the Transactions (including the Merger) or this
Agreement without the prior consent of the other party, unless such party
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by
applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement relating to the
Transactions (including the Merger) or this Agreement, in which event such
party shall, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, provide a
meaningful opportunity to the other party to review and comment upon such
press release or other announcement and shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; provided that
the Company shall not be required to provide any such review or comment to
Parent in connection with the receipt and existence of a Competing Proposal
and matters related thereto, or a Change of Recommendation, each of which
shall be governed exclusively by, and effected in accordance with, Section
5.2; provided, further, that each party hereto and their respective affiliates
may make statements that are not inconsistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company in compliance with this Section 6.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates may provide ordinary course
communications regarding this Agreement and the Transactions to existing or
prospective general and limited partners, equity holders, members, managers
and investors of any affiliates of such Person and the Debt Financing Sources,
in each case, who are subject to customary confidentiality restrictions.

Section 6.4 Directors' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification.

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, honor and fulfill
in all respects the obligations of the Company, to the fullest extent
permissible under applicable Law, under the Company Governing Documents in
effect on the date hereof and under any indemnification or other similar
agreements in effect on the date hereof (the "Indemnification Agreements") to
the directors, officers and other employees of the Company covered by such
Company Governing Documents or Indemnification Agreements (the "Covered
Persons") arising out of or relating to actions or omissions in their capacity
as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions.







69

 (b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.4(a), for a period of six
years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to:
(i) indemnify and hold harmless each Covered Person against and from any
reasonable and documented costs or expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Covered Person's capacity as a
director, officer or employee of the Company or (B) this Agreement and any of
the Transactions and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the reasonable and documented
expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) of any Covered
Person upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered Person
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Covered
Person is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation of a Covered Person for which indemnification may
be sought under this Section 6.4(b) unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination relates only to monetary damages for which the
Surviving Company is entirely responsible or includes an unconditional release
of such Covered Person from all liability arising out of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation or such Covered Person otherwise provides
prior written consent to such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the memorandum of
association and bye-laws of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of Covered Persons for periods prior to and including the
Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Governing
Documents. The Indemnification Agreements with Covered Persons that survive
the Merger shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to honor and fulfill, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, the Company's obligations to
the Covered Persons under the Indemnification Agreements. Prior to the
execution of this Agreement, the Company has delivered or made available to
Parent copies of such Indemnification Agreements.







70

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay for
"tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, "DandO Insurance"), with benefits and levels of coverage at least
as favorable, in the aggregate, to the applicable Covered Person as the
Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the Transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that in
no event shall the Company expend for such policies an annual premium amount
in the aggregate in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance prior to the date hereof. If the Company and the
Surviving Company for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies
as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place
as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least
as favorable, in the aggregate, as provided in the Company's existing policies
as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as provided in the Company's
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that in
no event shall Parent or the Surviving Company be required to expend for such
policies an annual premium amount in the aggregate in excess of 300% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date
hereof; and, provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Company shall obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(e) In the event the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
amalgamates or consolidates with, or merges into, any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such amalgamation,
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case ((i) or (ii)),
proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving
corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.

(f) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.4, and this Section 6.4 shall not be
amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including their
successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered Persons
(including their successors and heirs) affected thereby.







71

 Section 6.5 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to become
applicable to Parent, the Company, the Merger or any of the Transactions, then
each of Parent, the board of directors (or similar governing body) of Parent,
the Company and the Company Board of Directors shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to (a) render such Takeover Law (or the relevant
provisions thereof) inapplicable to the foregoing and (b) take all such
actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate and, if not possible,
minimize the effects of any such Takeover Law on the Merger.

Section 6.6 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Company to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, including
the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 6.7 Employee Benefits Matters.

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and for a period of one year
thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to
provide, to each employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries who
continues to be employed by the Company or the Surviving Company or any
Subsidiary thereof (the "Continuing Employees"), (i) a base salary or regular
hourly wage, whichever is applicable, that is not less than the base salary or
regular hourly wage provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual
target cash bonus opportunity at levels provided to such Continuing Employee
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (iii) severance benefits no less favorable than those provided under the
applicable plans, policies, contracts, or arrangements of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Company Benefit Plans") and (iv) employee benefits (other than as
required by clauses (ii) and (iii)) and also excluding any equity awards,
defined benefit pension and retiree medical and welfare benefits that are, in
the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to such Continuing
Employee (including their dependents) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time
and thereafter, Parent shall provide, and shall cause the Surviving Company to
provide, that periods of employment with the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(including any current or former affiliate, or any predecessor, of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary) shall be taken into account for purposes of
determining, as applicable, the eligibility for participation and vesting
(excluding benefit accrual) of any Continuing Employee under all employee
benefit plans maintained by Parent or an affiliate of Parent for the benefit
of the Continuing Employees, including vacation or other paid-time off plans
or arrangements and any severance plans (excluding defined benefit pension,
retiree plans, frozen plans, and plans closed to new participants).







72

 (b) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company to, use reasonable best efforts to (i) ensure that
no eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing
condition limitations or exclusions shall apply with respect to the Continuing
Employees under the applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Parent or
any affiliate of Parent, including the Surviving Company (except to the extent
applicable under Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time), (ii)
waive any and all evidence of insurability requirements with respect to such
Continuing Employees to the extent such evidence of insurability requirements
were not applicable to the Continuing Employees under the Benefits Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) credit each Continuing
Employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments paid
by such Continuing Employee under the health Benefit Plans of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the
Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
Continuing Employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she
has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any health Benefit Plan of Parent
or an affiliate of Parent (including the Surviving Company) for such year. The
Merger shall not affect any Continuing Employee's accrual of, or right to use,
in accordance with the policies, contracts or arrangements of the Company or
Company Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
personal, sick, vacation or other paid-time-off accrued but unused by such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent shall and hereby does, and
shall cause the Surviving Company and any successor thereto to: (i) assume the
Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' obligations under the Company Benefit
Plans, including all vested or accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual
rights of, current and former employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (including any such obligations or rights arising in connection
with the Transactions) and (ii) honor, fulfill and discharge such obligations
in accordance with their terms (including, without limitation, cash awards
granted prior to the Closing Date in accordance with Section 5.1(i)).







73

 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company or
any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any affiliate of Parent, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written
agreement between Parent, the Surviving Company, the Company or any affiliate
of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other
applicable plan or program covering such Continuing Employee, and subject to
Parent's obligations to provide severance pursuant to Section 6.7(a). For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall anything in this Agreement confer upon
any Continuing Employee the right to receive equity awards of Parent or any of
its affiliates following consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.7 shall
(i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any
Benefit Plan or benefit plan of Parent or its affiliates or (ii) create any
third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee or other
service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof) at any time.

Section 6.8 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each director (including directors
by deputization) or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.9 Control of Operations. Without in any way limiting any party's
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's operations prior to
the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.







74

 Section 6.10 Transaction Litigation. The Company shall promptly advise Parent
in writing of any Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent informed on a
reasonably prompt basis regarding any such Transaction Litigation. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to (a) participate in the defense,
settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation and (b) consult with
counsel to the Company regarding the defense, settlement or compromise with
respect to any such Transaction Litigation. For purposes of this Section 6.10,
"participate" means that Parent will be kept reasonably apprised of any
Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege
between the Company and its counsel would not be waived thereby), and Parent
may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation
that the Company shall consider in good faith, but shall not be deemed to mean
that Parent shall be entitled to control the defense, settlement or
prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; provided that the Company shall not
settle or compromise or agree to settle or compromise any Transaction
Litigation without Parent's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Following the Effective Time,
the Covered Persons may continue to retain counsel retained prior to the
Effective Time to defend any Transaction Litigation; provided, however, that
in no event shall Parent be required to retain more than one pre-Effective
Time counsel for all the Covered Persons as a group, unless required by
conflicts of interest between or among the Covered Persons.

Section 6.11 Deregistration and Delisting. Each of the parties hereto agrees
to cooperate with the other parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all
actions necessary to terminate the registration of the Class A Common Stock
under the Exchange Act and to cause the Class A Common Stock to be de-listed
from Nasdaq and the Prague Stock Exchange; provided that such termination and
such de-listings shall not be effective until at or after the Effective Time.







75

 Section 6.12 Company Indebtedness; Shareholder Guarantees. Parent agrees that
it shall, and shall cause its controlled affiliates to, take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause, on the Closing Date, the repayment and
satisfaction in full (including accrued interest, guarantee fees, and any
prepayment fees or penalties or other amounts due as a result of or arising
from such prepayment) of the indebtedness and other obligations of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the debt financing arrangements
listed or described in Schedule 6.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter
(collectively, the "Company Indebtedness") in the amounts set forth in the
payoff letters referred to in the next sentence. The Company shall, and shall
cause the applicable Company Subsidiaries to, arrange for customary payoff
letters, lien releases and other instruments of discharge to be executed and
delivered in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent (with executed
copies provided to Parent) at least four business days prior to Closing
providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing Date in
full of the Company Indebtedness and the discharge of the Shareholder
Guarantees and Liens securing the same, and shall deliver, or cause the
applicable Company Subsidiaries to deliver, prepayment and termination notices
in accordance with the terms of the Company Indebtedness (provided that such
prepayment and termination notices may be conditional on the occurrence of the
Closing) and take all other actions necessary to facilitate the payoff of the
Company Indebtedness, the termination of the Shareholder Guarantees and the
termination and release of all Liens securing the Company Indebtedness and the
Shareholder Guarantees.

Section 6.13 Financing.

(a) Each of Merger Sub and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, consummate and
obtain the proceeds of the Financing on terms and conditions no less favorable
to Merger Sub and Parent than those described in the Financing Documents (as
may be amended or modified in accordance with this Agreement) (and taking into
account "market flex" provisions contemplated by the Debt Financing
Documents), including using their respective reasonable best efforts to: (i)
satisfy, or use reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives to
satisfy, on a timely basis, all conditions applicable to, and within the
control of, Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in the
Financing Documents and (ii) upon the satisfaction of the conditions thereto
and to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the Merger,
consummate the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing at the Closing, and
cause the lenders who are party to the Debt Financing Documents and the Equity
Investor who is party to the Equity Commitment Letter, and any other Person
providing Financing, to fund the Financing at the Closing.







76

 (b) Merger Sub and Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned): (i) agree
to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition
or other provision or remedy under the Financing Documents, to the extent such
amendments, modifications or waivers would reduce the aggregate amount of cash
proceeds available from the Financing to an amount that is less than the
amount necessary to fund the amounts required to be paid by Merger Sub or
Parent under this Agreement (as compared to the amount of such aggregate
proceeds contemplated under the Financing Documents as in effect on the date
hereof); (ii) agree to impose new or additional conditions precedent or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions precedent to funding
of the Financing as provided in the Financing Documents, other than conditions
which are likely to be satisfied and which do not (A) prevent or delay the
funding of the Financing or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to obtaining the Financing (taking
into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) less likely to occur
and (iii) release or consent to the termination of the obligations of lenders,
the Equity Investor and other Persons under the Financing Documents, except
for (A) assignments and replacements of an individual lender in accordance
with the terms of the syndication provisions of the Debt Financing Documents
with respect to the Debt Financing, or in accordance with the terms of the
Equity Commitment Letter or Section 6.13(d) with respect to the Equity
Financing or (B) in connection with any amendment, modification, waiver or
replacement thereof otherwise permitted hereby. For clarity, the foregoing
shall not prohibit Merger Sub and Parent from amending the Debt Financing
Documents to add or replace lender(s), lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities and their respective affiliates as
parties thereto or in any other manner consistent with this Agreement as a
party thereto, or to exercise any "market flex" provisions contemplated by the
Debt Financing Documents.

(c) In no event shall Merger Sub or Parent prohibit or seek to prohibit any
bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity
financing, from providing or seeking to provide financing or financial
advisory services to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is unrelated to the Merger or the
Transactions.







77

 (d) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Debt Financing Documents
(other than as a result of the Company's breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement), (i) Parent shall
promptly so notify the Company and (ii) Merger Sub and Parent shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative debt financing
from the same or alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions (or replace any unavailable portion of the
Financing necessary to consummate the Transactions) on terms and conditions
that are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Merger Sub and
Parent than those in the Financing Documents that such alternative debt

alternative debt financing agreement entered into in accordance with this
Section 6.13 and (ii) keep the Company reasonably informed in a timely manner
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or any alternative debt
financing under this Section 6.13).

(f) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Debt
Financing, or any alternative debt financing pursuant to Section 6.13(d), is
not a condition to Closing.

(e) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay the amount due

which such applicable Termination Fee is payable, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone by such compensated party while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.







91

limiting or affecting Parent's rights to specific enforcement expressly set
forth in Section 9.13, in any circumstance in which this Agreement is
terminated and Parent is entitled to the Company Termination Fee from the
Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a), such termination of this Agreement and
receipt of payment of the Company Termination Fee (together with any costs and
expenses of Parent due under Section 8.3(e)) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the
Parent Related Parties against the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or
any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
employees, partners, shareholders, managers, members, affiliates,

or (iv) any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith (collectively, the "Company Transaction
Related Matters"), and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, and none of Parent, Merger
Sub, nor any other Parent Related Party shall seek or be entitled to seek or
recover any other damages or seek or be entitled to any other remedy, whether
based on a claim at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, with
respect to any losses or damages suffered in connection with any Company
Transaction Related Matters. Parent, on behalf of itself and the Parent
Related Parties, acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall (x) the
Company's liability for its actual and intentional fraud or Willful Breach of
its representations, warranties, agreements or covenants pursuant to Section
8.2 exceed an aggregate amount equal to (1) $5,000,000, in the case of any
actual and intentional fraud or Willful Breach of the covenants contained in
Section 5.1 or (2) the amount of the Company Termination Fee, in all other
such cases, and (y) the Company be liable for both (1) damages for the
Company's actual and intentional fraud or Willful Breach of its

set forth in Section 9.13, the termination of this Agreement under the
circumstances specified in Section







92

tort or otherwise) of the Company Related Parties against any of Parent,

consent of the other parties, except that (a) Merger Sub may transfer or
assign all (but not less than all) of its rights and obligations under this

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.







113

 (b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Except as set forth in this
Section 9.13, it is agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement, the Guarantee
and, subject to Section 9.13(d) and Section 9.13(e), respectively, the Equity

therein.

Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, subject to Section 9.13(d),
each party hereby waives any objections to the grant of the equitable remedy
of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by
any other parties to this Agreement (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity, or that the
provisions set forth in Section 8.3 adequately compensate for the harm that
would result from a breach of this Agreement or should otherwise be construed
to diminish or impair any party's right to specific performance hereunder),
and, subject to Section 9.13(d), each party shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party under
this Agreement, all in accordance with the terms of this Section 9.13. In the
event any party seeks an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, such party shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such order or injunction, all in accordance with
the terms of this Section 9.13.







114

this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with enforcing Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded to fund the Transactions (but not the right of the
Company to such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies
for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that: (i) all
conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 would have been satisfied if the
Closing were to have occurred as of the time the Closing should have occurred
in accordance with Section 1.2 (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but which are then capable of being
satisfied at the Closing but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be
funded), (ii) the Debt Financing (including any alternative financing that has
been obtained in accordance with Section 6.13(d)) has been funded in
accordance with the terms thereof, or will be funded in accordance with the
terms thereof at the Closing upon delivery of a drawdown notice by Merger Sub
or notice from Merger Sub that the Equity Financing will be funded at the
Closing, (iii) the Company has confirmed to Parent in writing that (A) all
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but which are then capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or that it is
willing to waive any such open conditions and (B) if specific performance is
granted and if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Closing will occur and (iv) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate
the Closing by the date on which the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 1.2. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
Company be entitled to specific performance to cause all or any portion of the
Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letter) or cause Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or
other Transactions (including the obligation to pay the Merger Consideration)
if the Debt Financing has not been funded or will not be funded at the Closing
even if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in no event will the Company seek the remedy
of specific performance of this Agreement against any Lender Related Parties.







115

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with enforcing Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation to enforce the terms of
the Debt Financing Documents, including any alternative financing that has
been obtained in accordance with Section 6.13(d) (but not the right of the
Company to such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies
for any other reason), shall be subject to the requirements that: (i) all
conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
which are then capable of being satisfied at the Closing) and Parent and
Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing as required pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (ii) all of the conditions to the
consummation of the financing provided by the Debt Financing Documents
(including any alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with
Section 6.13(d)) have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but which are then capable of
being satisfied at the Closing).

Section 9.14 Non-Recourse.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any of the agreements
relating to the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing to the contrary, each
party agrees, on behalf of itself and its affiliates and Representatives, that
all proceedings, claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of action (whether
in contract or in tort, in law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by
statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other
theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that may be based upon,
in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate
to any Company Transaction Related Matter or any Parent Transaction Related
Matter, as applicable, including the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement or such other agreement), in each case, may be made only
against (and are those solely of) the persons that are expressly identified
herein as a party to this Agreement (or a party to any such other agreement
referenced herein or contemplated hereunder) and, in accordance with, and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (or the terms of any
such other agreement referenced herein or contemplated hereunder).







116

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, other than in
connection with the Company's right to seek to specifically enforce the Equity
Commitment Letter in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter and claims by the Company
against the Guarantor in connection with and under the terms of the Guarantee,
in no event shall the Company or any of the Company Related Parties, and the
Company agrees not to and to cause the Company Related Parties not to, seek to
enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement
against, or make any claims in respect of any Parent Transaction Related
Matters against or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Parent Related
Party other than Parent or Merger Sub.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company on
behalf of itself and the Company Subsidiaries (i) hereby waives any rights or
claims against any Lender Related Party in any way related to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing (including
with respect to the Debt Financing Documents) and (ii) agrees not to commence
any such action or proceeding against any Lender Related Party. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed

punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature.
