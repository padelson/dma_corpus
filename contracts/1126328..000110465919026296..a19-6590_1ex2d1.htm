Closing Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers independent
accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers, reports,
correspondence or other similar materials available to Buyer or its
Representatives except in accordance with such accountants normal disclosure
procedures and then only after Buyer or its Representatives, as applicable,
have signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers,
reports, correspondence, or other similar materials in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such accountants, (ii) make available employees of
Seller and its Affiliates knowledgeable about the Initial Closing Statement to

to preserve (and not destroy) any records related to the Accounts Receivable,

agrees that, following the Effective Time through the date that the Final
Closing Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with _Section
2.10_, it will (and will cause its Affiliates to) maintain records in a manner
consistent with past practice of Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect
to the Business to the extent required to meet Sellers obligations set forth
in this _Section 2.9_ and _Section 2.10_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that
the sole purpose of the determination of the Net Accounts Receivable is to
adjust the Closing Consideration so as to accurately reflect the Net Accounts
Receivable as of the Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 2.10** **_Reconciliation of Estimated Closing Statement;
Adjustment_**.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall notify Seller in writing (the " **Notice of Disagreement** ")
prior to the expiration of the Review Period if Buyer disagrees with the
Initial Closing Statement. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in
reasonable detail (i) the basis for such dispute, (ii) the amounts involved
and (iii) Buyers determination of the amount of the Net Accounts Receivable
as of the Effective Time. If no Notice of Disagreement is delivered by Buyer
prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the Initial Closing
Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by Buyer and shall become
final and binding upon the parties hereto in accordance with _Section
2.10(e)_.

 



 

(b) During the twenty (20) Business Days immediately following the delivery of
a Notice of Disagreement (the " **Consultation Period** "), Seller and Buyer
shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If, during the
Consultation Period, Seller and Buyer mutually agree upon any matters set
forth in the Notice of Disagreement, they shall signify such agreement in a
writing signed by both such parties.

 



 

(c) If, at the end of the Consultation Period, Seller and Buyer have been
unable to resolve one or more differences with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall submit such
matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of Disagreement to
the Independent Accounting Firm (each a " **Disputed Item** "). At

 



     

 

 



 

the time of the submission of the Disputed Items to the Independent Accounting
Firm, each of Seller and Buyer shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm
a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail their respective
positions with respect to the Disputed Items. Seller and Buyer shall also have
the opportunity to submit a written response to the other partys written
statement to the Independent Accounting Firm, no later than ten (10) days
following the date of receipt of such other partys initial written statement.
The failure of either such party to timely deliver its initial written
statement or response to such other partys initial written statement shall
constitute a waiver of such partys right to submit the same, unless the
Independent Accounting Firm determines otherwise. During the review by the
Independent Accounting Firm, each of Buyer and Seller and their respective
accountants will make available to the Independent Accounting Firm
individuals, information, books and records and work papers, as may be
reasonably requested by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.10(c)_ and _Section 2.10(d)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Sellers and Buyers respective accountants shall not be
obligated to make any work papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm
or to the other party hereto except in accordance with such accountants
normal disclosure procedures and then only after the Independent Accounting
Firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. In acting
under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall act as experts in
accounting and not as arbitrators. All written communications to or from the
Independent Accounting Firm, on the one hand, and Seller or Buyer (or any of
their respective Representatives), on the other hand, shall be delivered
simultaneously to Seller and Buyer, as applicable. In determining the Disputed
Items, the Independent Accounting Firm shall be bound by the terms of this
Agreement (including the Reference Statement) and shall not conduct any
independent review of any matters.

 



 

(d) With respect to each Disputed Item, such determination, if not in
accordance with the position of either Seller or Buyer, shall not be in excess
of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Buyer in
the Notice of Disagreement or by Seller in the Initial Closing Statement with
respect to such disputed line item. During such determination period, the
Independent Accounting Firm also shall be instructed to (i) prepare a
statement of the Net Accounts Receivable as of the Effective Time based upon
all of the line items not disputed by the parties hereto and the line items
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with the foregoing
provisions and (ii) determine the amount of the Net Accounts Receivable
reflected on such statement. Seller and Buyer shall instruct the Independent
Accounting Firm to (A) make a final determination only in respect of Disputed
Items, (B) make such determination in a manner consistent with the manner in
which the Reference Statement was prepared and (C) deliver such determination
to such parties within thirty (30) Business Days after such submission, which
determination shall be binding on the parties hereto and shall not be subject
to appeal (absent manifest or mathematical error); _provided_ that the failure
of the Independent Accounting Firm to deliver its written decision within such
time period shall not constitute a defense or objection to the finality or
enforcement of such determination. The statement of the Net Accounts
Receivable that is final and binding on the parties hereto, as determined
either through agreement of the parties hereto pursuant to _Section 2.10(a)_
or _2.10(b)_ or through the action of the Independent Accounting Firm,
pursuant to this _Section 2.10(d)_, is referred to as the " **Final Closing
Statement**." The cost of, and expenses associated with, the Independent
Accounting Firms review and determination shall be shared equally by Seller,
on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.

 



      

 

 



 

(e) Not later than three (3) Business Days after the Final Closing Statement
is final and binding on the parties hereto, as determined either through
agreement of the parties hereto pursuant to _Section 2.10(a)_ or _2.10(b)_
or through the action of the Independent Accounting Firm, pursuant to _Section
2.10(d)_:

 



 

(i) The " **Post-Closing Adjustment** " shall be the amount of the (A) Net
Accounts Receivable set forth in the Final Closing Statement _minus_ (B) Net
Estimated Accounts Receivable, which amount shall be positive or negative.

 



 

(ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then Buyer shall pay
in cash to an account designated by Seller (for its own account or as agent
for the account of its applicable Affiliates) the amount of the Post-Closing
Adjustment.

 



 

(iii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then Seller shall
pay in cash to an account designated by Buyer (for its own account or as agent
for the account of its applicable Affiliates) the absolute value of the amount
of the Post-Closing Adjustment.

 



 

(f) The " **Purchase Price** " shall be equal to the Closing Consideration, as
adjusted in accordance with this _Article II_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, any payments under this _Section 2.10_ shall
be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for any Tax purposes, except
as otherwise required by Law.

 



 

 **Section 2.11** **_Earn-Out Payment._**

 



 

(a) Seller shall deliver to Buyer, on the Closing Date, a statement (the "
**Base Date Fee Revenue Statement** ") setting forth Sellers calculation of
the Base Date Fee Revenue, together with such schedules and data as may be
appropriate to support such statement.

 



 

(b) During the sixty (60) day period immediately following Buyers receipt of
the Base Date Fee Revenue Statement (the " **Base Date Review Period** "),
Seller shall provide Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable access to
(x) all records, books, work papers, reports, correspondence and other
relevant materials in the possession of Seller or its Affiliates that relate
to the calculation of the Base Date Fee Revenue and the preparation of the

associated with the Base Date Customers and each plan (as defined herein), by
applying a degree of care and diligence no less stringent, in aggregate, than
they apply in retaining customers of, and maintaining fee revenue associated
with, customers of Buyer and its Affiliates similar businesses; and

 



 

(ii) not take, or cause to be taken, any action, including any action with
respect to Transferred Employees who are relationship managers or serve in a
similar role, that reduces the revenue of Buyer and its Affiliates generated,
or to be generated, in respect of any Customer Contract (and plan (as defined

portion of the recordkeeping, trust and custody and/or discretionary business
of Buyer and its Affiliates is transferred to a Person who is not an Affiliate
of Buyer (any transaction contemplated by clauses (i) or (ii) being referred
to as a " **Sale Transaction** "), then, in each case, the obligation of Buyer
to pay the Earn-Out Payment to Seller (at maximum performance levels)
hereunder shall be accelerated and Buyer shall (A) promptly provide notice of
the Sale Transaction to Seller (upon the entry into an agreement to effect and
consummation of a Sale Transaction) and (B) no later than ten (10) calendar
days following the earlier of the entry into an agreement to effect a Sale

the parties in connection with _Section 2.11(l)_- _(o)_ shall not be subject
to the dispute procedures set forth in _Section 2.11(a)_- _(k)_ , but rather
shall be subject to the procedures set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof and
(ii) Buyer shall not be liable for any breach of _Section 2.11(l)_- _(o)_ to
the extent such breach was caused by Sellers breach of Sections 2.12-2.14 of

 **Section 2.13** **_Tax Withholding_**. Notwithstanding any provision herein
to the contrary, Buyer shall not be entitled to deduct or withhold from the
Purchase Price any amount, except as required by Law. If any Law requires the
deduction or withholding of any Tax from the Purchase Price, Buyer shall be
entitled to deduct or withhold such amounts; _provided_ that as soon as

so deducted or withheld and Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in good faith to
minimize or eliminate such withholding Taxes. Any amounts so deducted or

 **Section 5.2** **_Employment Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make a Comparable
Job Offer to each Business Employee no later than (i) ten (10) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date (or, with respect to any TSA Business
Employee, the date on which the TSA Services Period expires (or such earlier
date or dates as the parties shall agree to effect the transfer of the
employment of such TSA Business Employee, as necessary or appropriate to
effect a smooth and orderly transition of the operation of the Business to
Buyer and its Affiliates), as applicable, any such date, a " **TSA End Date**
"), which offer shall be irrevocable and provide that employment shall be
effective as of the Closing Date (or, with respect to any TSA Business
Employee, the applicable TSA End Date), or, (ii) for Business Employees who
are on Leave, ten (10) Business Days prior to the date that such Business
Employee is anticipated to return to active employment if such date is within
one (1) year following the Closing Date, which offer shall be irrevocable and
provide that employment shall be effective as of the date that such Business
Employee returns to active employment (the Closing Date or such later date
that the Business Employee commences employment with Buyer or one of its
Affiliates, as applicable, any such date, a " **Hire Date** "); _provided_
that any Comparable Job Offer made to a Non-U.S. Business Employee shall be
made at such earlier time as is necessary to comply with Law, local practice
and any applicable notice periods (and, with respect to any TSA Business
Employee who is a Non-U.S. Business Employee, at least one hundred and twenty
(120) days prior to the applicable TSA End Date). If Buyer declines to make or
otherwise fails to make a Comparable Job Offer to any applicable Business
Employee as and when otherwise required pursuant to this _Section 5.2_, the
consequence shall be that Buyer will be responsible for any and all Inadequate
Offer Payments that are payable in respect of such Business Employee. At least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date any Comparable Job Offer is provided
to any Business Employee, Buyer shall provide Seller with a template offer of
employment to be used for purposes of the Comparable Job Offers, and Buyer
shall in good faith consider and incorporate

 



     

 

 



 

any reasonable comments provided by Seller. As of the applicable Hire Date,
each Transferred Employee shall have a "separation from service" as that term
is defined by Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the date Buyer or its
Affiliate is expected to be required to make any Comparable Job Offer, Seller
shall provide or make available to Buyer or its Affiliate a schedule listing
the following for each Business Employee who is expected to receive such an
offer on such date: then current base salary, target cash incentive
opportunity, position, primary work location, and other compensation then in
effect for Buyer and its Affiliates to fulfill their obligations under this
_Section 5.2_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates guarantee that any offer made by
Buyer to any Business Employee which constitutes a Comparable Job Offer will
be accepted by such Business Employee or that any Business Employee will not
make a counter offer to such offer of employment.

 



 

(b) As of the applicable Hire Date and for a period of one (1) year
thereafter, while employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, each Transferred
Employee shall be employed on terms no less favorable than the terms required
by the applicable Comparable Job Offer. Notwithstanding any provision herein
to the contrary, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to
continue to employ any Transferred Employee for any specific period of time
following the Closing Date, subject to Law.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each Transferred
Employee whose employment terminates within one (1) year following the
applicable Hire Date with cash severance payments and availability for partial
reimbursement of continued medical coverage under the provisions of COBRA that
collectively are no less favorable than the greater of the cash salary
continuation severance payments and subsidized health benefits that (i) would
have been provided to the Transferred Employee under the Wells Fargo Severance
Plan applicable to such Business Employee upon a similar termination of
employment occurring immediately prior to the applicable Hire Date or (ii) are
provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates upon a
similar termination of employment, in each case taking into account (A) the
Transferred Employees service with (x) Seller and its Affiliates prior to the
applicable Hire Date and (y) Buyer and its Affiliates after the applicable
Hire Date and (B) any increase (but not decrease) in compensation applicable
to the Transferred Employee after the applicable Hire Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, regardless of whether the amount of any severance benefits
payable shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable Wells Fargo Severance Plan, payment of such benefits shall be in
the form (i.e., cash severance paid in a lump sum and continued medical
coverage as a partial reimbursement of COBRA premiums) applicable under the
terms of the severance plan maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates.

 



 

(d) For all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate in, and
benefit accrual, vesting and retirement eligibility under, any employee
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in which a Transferred Employee is eligible to participate
following the Hire Date, each Transferred Employee shall be credited with the
Transferred Employees service with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the
applicable Hire Date and Buyer and its Affiliates after the applicable Hire
Date; _provided_ that such service shall not be recognized either (x) with
respect to U.S. Business Employees, for purposes of benefit accruals under any
defined benefit retirement plan or retiree medical benefits arrangement
maintained by

 



     

 

 



 

Buyer or any of its Affiliates or (y) to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits. Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to
(1) waive any preexisting conditions, actively at work requirements and
waiting periods under the employee benefit plans, programs, agreements and
arrangements of Buyer and its Affiliates that provide healthcare and
disability benefits in which the Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate, to the same extent that such conditions and waiting periods were
waived or previously satisfied under the comparable Employee Benefit Plan
prior to the applicable Hire Date, and (2) with respect to U.S. Business
Employees cause such plans, programs, agreements and arrangements to honor any
expenses incurred by such Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents
under Employee Benefit Plans that are healthcare benefit plans during the
portion of the calendar year in which he or she becomes a Transferred Employee
for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance, maximum out-
of-pocket, and similar expenses, to the same extent that such expenses were
recognized under the comparable Employee Benefit Plan. Buyer shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, provide any payment, encouragement or
incentive to any Business Employee or Transferred Employee to induce such
employee to elect continued participation in any healthcare benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement of Seller or any of its Affiliates. Seller,
Buyer and each of their respective Affiliates shall cooperate to effect the
transfer of information reasonably required to enable Buyer to comply with
this _Section 5.2(d)_ as soon as practicable after the applicable Hire Date.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, have in effect a
tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan as of the Effective Time
that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code in which each Transferred Employee primarily
located in the U.S. shall be eligible to participate as of the applicable Hire
Date (the " **Buyer 401(k) Plan**"). Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, permit each Transferred Employee to effect a direct rollover
(as described in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code and including the in-kind
rollover of notes evidencing loans) of such Transferred Employees balance
(including after-tax employee contributions) under the Wells Fargo 401(k) Plan
to the Buyer 401(k) Plan within a reasonable time from and after the Effective
Time (or, with respect to the in-kind rollover of notes evidencing loans, as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days, following the
applicable Hire Date) if such direct rollover is elected in accordance with
Law by such Transferred Employee. Seller, Buyer and their respective
Affiliates, as applicable, shall cooperate to take any and all commercially
reasonable actions needed to permit each Transferred Employee with an
outstanding loan balance under the Wells Fargo 401(k) Plan as of the Effective
Time to continue to make scheduled loan payments to the Wells Fargo 401(k)
Plan after the Effective Time, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover
of the notes evidencing such loans from the Wells Fargo 401(k) Plan to the
Buyer 401(k) Plan so as to prevent, to the extent reasonably possible, a
deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to such outstanding loans.

 



 

(f) Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for the payment of
any (i) annual cash incentive payments to a Transferred Employee that relate
to a performance period that has been completed prior to the applicable Hire
Date of the Transferred Employee (the " **Completed Period Bonuses** ");
_provided_ that Buyer and its Affiliates shall promptly reimburse Seller and
its Affiliates for the portion of any Completed Period Bonuses that relates to
the period between the Closing Date and the Hire Date in respect of a TSA
Business Employee, (ii) long-term cash awards in respect of a Transferred
Employee that have not been paid to the

 



     

 

 



 

applicable Transferred Employee as of the applicable Hire Date and (iii) any
incremental compensation that Seller determines to provide to any such TSA
Business Employee (other than pursuant to the Retention Bonus Arrangement) to
induce such individual to remain employed with the Seller and its Affiliates
during and/or through the TSA End Date. Any such payments shall be made to the
applicable Transferred Employees, less applicable withholding for Taxes, at
substantially the same time as such payments are made to similarly situated
employees of Seller and its Affiliates. Seller and its Affiliates shall also
remain solely responsible with respect to any equity awards relating to shares
of Wells Fargo and Company common stock that are held by Transferred Employees
and outstanding immediately prior to the applicable Hire Date.

 



 

(g) Seller or one of its Affiliates shall make a prorated annual cash bonus
payment to each Transferred Employee in respect of the performance period in
effect as of the applicable Hire Date of the Transferred Employee in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Wells Fargo Annual Bonus Plan,
with each such payment being made on the same day as payments are made to
employees under the terms and conditions of the applicable Wells Fargo Annual
Bonus Plan; _provided_ that Buyer and its Affiliates shall promptly reimburse
Seller and its Affiliates for the portion of any such payment that relates to
the period between the Closing Date and the Hire Date in respect of a TSA
Business Employee. Buyer and its Affiliates shall take all actions necessary
such that each Transferred Employee shall be eligible to receive a prorated
annual cash bonus opportunity for the portion of the year in which the Closing
occurs following the applicable Hire Date of the Transferred Employee that is
(i) with respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, no less favorable than the
annual cash bonus opportunity afforded to similarly situated employees of
Buyer and its Affiliates and (ii) with respect to non-U.S. Transferred
Employees, no less favorable than that afforded by Seller and its Affiliates
immediately prior to the applicable Hire Date.

 



 

(h) Prior to the Hire Date, and to the extent required by Law, Seller and its
Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consent from
each Business Employee who receives offers of employment pursuant to _Section
5.2(a)_ to transfer to Buyer or any of its Affiliates copies of such Business
Employees official personnel file (the " **Personnel File** "). Subject to
and in accordance with Law, Seller and its Affiliates shall cooperate in good
faith to grant access to or transfer copies of all Transferred Employees
Personnel Files to Buyer at or promptly following the applicable Hire Date of
each Transferred Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller nor
any of its Affiliates will grant access to or transfer a copy of any Business
Employees Personnel File to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (A) prior to the
receipt by Seller or any of its Affiliates of such Business Employees consent
to such access or transfer and (B) unless such employee is a Transferred
Employee.

 



 

(i) Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates, as applicable, shall timely
execute and deliver to each other a HIPAA non-disclosure agreement in the form
and substance reasonably determined by Seller and Buyer to comply with HIPAA.

 



 

(j) Any communications by Buyer or any of its Affiliates with the Business
Employees prior to the applicable Hire Date shall be subject to and in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement. During the period from the date
hereof through the applicable Hire Date, Buyer and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate to communicate to the Business Employees the details of the proposed
terms and conditions of their employment with Buyer or its Affiliates.

 



      

 

 



 

All communications (other than the Comparable Job Offer) between Buyer or its
Affiliates and the Business Employees prior to the Hire Date shall be subject
to Sellers reasonable prior approval which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 



 

(k) With respect to any Transferred Employee, (i) Seller or one of its
Affiliates shall be solely responsible for workers compensation claims by or
with respect to such Transferred Employee based on injuries or illnesses that
occurred prior to the applicable Hire Date and (ii) Buyer or one of its
Affiliates shall be solely responsible for workers compensation claims by or
with respect to any Transferred Employee based on injuries or illnesses that
occur on or after the applicable Hire Date. For purposes of this _Section
5.2(k)_, the date an injury or illness resulting in a workers compensation
claim occurred shall be determined in accordance with the terms of Law in
respect of workers compensation. The parties hereto agree that they will
cooperate fully with such other party and with the applicable insurers and/or
third-party claims administrators by providing needed information to determine
the date of the injury or illness.

 



 

(l) Buyer and Seller shall implement the retention bonus arrangement set forth
in Section 5.2(l) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " **Retention Bonus
Arrangement** ").

 



 

(m) If, after the date hereof, Seller determines that any employee of Seller
or any of its Affiliates who is not listed in Section 1.1(D) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter meets the definition of a Business Employee, then (i) Seller
shall promptly make available to Buyer the information contemplated by
_Section 3.8(c)_ with respect to such individual and (ii) if mutually
determined by Buyer and Seller in good faith, such individual shall thereafter
be determined to be a Business Employee for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(n) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to, or does, (i)
constitute an amendment, waiver or modification of any Employee Benefit Plan
(or the terms thereof), (ii) prevent Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their respective benefit plans
in accordance with the applicable terms therein, (iii) constitute a contract
of employment (or guarantee any particular term or condition of employment) or
prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates, after the applicable Hire Date, from
terminating the employment of any Transferred Employee, in each case, subject
to the provisions of Law, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights,
claims or causes or action in favor of any Business Employee, or any
beneficiary or dependents thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Business
Employee by Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or under any
benefit plan that Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates may
maintain.

their respective Affiliates, to cooperate with each other with respect to any
public disclosure of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby prior to such public disclosure.
Buyer and Seller agree that no public release or announcement concerning the
terms of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be issued by either party hereto or any
of their respective Affiliates without the prior consent of Buyer and Seller,
as applicable, except for any such release or announcement (i) as may be
required by Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange
or the

 



     

 

 



 

requirements of any self-regulatory body, in which case, to the extent
practical and permitted by Law, the party hereto required to make the release
or announcement shall use reasonable best efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release (and will consider any such
comments in good faith) or announcement in advance of such issuance (ii) as
would be commercially reasonable in the course of non-written communications
with either partys or their respective Affiliates investors, and any written

the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as confidential in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2018,
by and between Principal Financial Group, Inc. and Seller Parent (the "
**Confidentiality Agreement** "). In the event of a conflict or inconsistency
between the terms expressly set forth in this Agreement (rather than
incorporated by reference herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms
of this Agreement will govern. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are
hereby incorporated by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect

Affiliates and their respective Representatives who need to know such
information) and (iii) not use any Seller Confidential Information, except
that Buyer or its Affiliates may disclose Seller Confidential Information (A)
to the extent required by Law, in any report, statement, testimony or other
submission to any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over Buyer or its
Affiliates, as applicable, (B) in order to comply with any Law or fiduciary
obligation applicable to Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, or on behalf
of a Third Party in its capacity as trustee (to the extent authorized to do so
by such Third Party) (C) in response to any summons, subpoena or other legal
process or formal or informal investigative demand issued to Buyer or its
Affiliates, as applicable, in the course of any litigation, investigation or
administrative proceeding or (D) to report a violation of Law to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, including to the U.S. Department of Labor
with respect to any Plan subject to ERISA, in connection with (x) any required
filing, (y) any request for relief from any applicable prohibitions or (z) any
effort (undertaken in good faith) to mitigate damages arising from such
violation or as otherwise may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances
in respect of addressing such violation. If Buyer or any of its Affiliates
becomes legally compelled by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar judicial or administrative
process to disclose any Seller Confidential Information, Buyer shall, to the
extent permitted by Law and reasonably practicable, (I) provide Seller with
prompt prior written notice of such requirement and (II) cooperate with Seller
and Sellers Affiliates (at Sellers expense) to obtain a protective order or
similar remedy to cause such Seller Confidential Information not to be
disclosed, including interposing all available objections thereto, such as

 



     

 

 



 

objections based on settlement privilege. In the event that such protective
order or other similar remedy is not obtained, Buyer or its applicable
Affiliates shall furnish only that portion of Seller Confidential Information
that has been legally compelled, and shall exercise its reasonable best
efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
disclosed Seller Confidential Information. Buyer hereby agrees, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates Representatives, to protect
Seller Confidential Information by using the same degree of care, but no less
than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of
Seller Confidential Information as Buyer uses to protect its own confidential
information of a like nature.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its and their Representatives (i) to, maintain the confidentiality of,

Seller, (C) in order to comply with any Law or fiduciary obligation applicable
to Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable, or on behalf of a Third Party in
its capacity as trustee (to the extent authorized to do so by such Third
Party) or (D) in response to any summons, subpoena or other legal process or
formal or informal investigative demand issued to Seller or its Affiliates, as
applicable, in the course of any litigation, investigation or administrative
proceeding. If Seller or any of its Affiliates becomes legally compelled by
deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar judicial or administrative process to disclose
any Business Confidential Information, Seller shall, to the extent permitted
by Law and reasonably practicable, (I) provide Buyer with prompt prior written
notice of such requirement and (II) cooperate with Buyer and Buyers
Affiliates (at Buyers expense) to obtain a protective order or similar remedy
to cause Business Confidential Information not to be disclosed, including
interposing all available objections thereto, such as objections based on
settlement privilege. In the event that such protective order or other similar
remedy is not obtained, Seller or its applicable Affiliates shall furnish only
that portion of Business Confidential Information that has been legally
compelled, and shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded such disclosed Business
Confidential Information. Seller hereby agrees, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its and their Representatives, to protect the Business Confidential
Information by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable
degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of Business
Confidential Information as Seller or its applicable Affiliate uses to protect
its own confidential information of a like nature.

Confidential Information, all information made available to Buyer or its
Affiliates prior to the Closing by Seller or its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives (including information disclosed in the course of
negotiation of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements) regarding Seller or
its Affiliates, and not directly related to the Business, except that "Seller
Confidential Information" shall not include, except with respect to Personal
Information, information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the
public (other than as a result of its disclosure in violation

 



     

 

 



 

of _Section 5.4(b)_ above), (ii) was already known to Buyer or its Affiliates
(other than by previous disclosure by Seller or its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives) as of the date hereof and not subject to any duty
of confidentiality to Seller or its Affiliates, (iii) is independently
developed by Buyer or its Affiliates without reference to any Seller
Confidential Information or (iv) after the Closing Date, is lawfully made

other agents (collectively, " **Representatives** ") of Buyer reasonable
access during normal business hours to the Representatives, properties,
offices and other facilities of Seller and its Affiliates (in respect of the
Business), and its and its Affiliates respective books and records (solely to
the extent in respect of the Business), and shall furnish Buyer with such
existing financial, operating and other data and information solely to the
extent related to the Business, as Buyer, through its Representatives, may
reasonably request (in each case, other than any Form I-9 and any Personnel
File of any Business Employee). In exercising its rights hereunder, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, conduct itself and themselves
so as not to interfere in the conduct of the Business or the other businesses

of its Affiliates shall be required to disclose to Buyer, its Affiliates or

good faith determination, would reasonably be expected to violate any Law or
obligation of confidentiality owed by Seller or its Affiliates to a Third

in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege
(including the attorney-client and work product privileges) in the good faith
opinion of Seller or any of its Affiliates, as applicable, (C) would result in
the disclosure of any competitively sensitive information unrelated to the
Business of Seller or any of its Affiliates or (D) would result in the

Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain waivers or make other

 



     

 

 



 

arrangements (including redacting information or making substitute disclosure
arrangements) that would enable disclosure to Buyer or its Representatives to
occur without contravening such Law, obligation of confidentiality, or
fiduciary obligation, disclosing such competitively sensitive information
unrelated to the Business, or jeopardizing such privilege, and (ii) Tax Return
that includes Seller or any of its Affiliates or any Tax-related work papers.

information set forth in Section 2.2(s) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Each
of Seller and Buyer shall provide the other with written notice thirty (30)

notice stating its intent to reproduce or take such materials no later than
twenty (20) Business Days after having received notice that such materials are
to be transferred, destroyed, or discarded.

Buyer in accordance with _Section 5.6(a)_, Buyer and any applicable
Affiliates shall permit Seller or its Affiliates and their authorized
Representatives to have reasonable access and duplication rights during normal

prior notice and during normal business hours, for any reasonable business
purpose relating to the Business, including in connection with Sellers

statements, and the conduct of any audit or investigation by a Governmental
Entity or any litigation relating to the Business (other than any litigation
or dispute between Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or its
Affiliates, on the other hand), or the pursuit or defense of any other
Asserted Liability (whether or not such Asserted Liability is the subject of
an indemnification claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified

(i) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts, and Buyer and its Affiliates
shall cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates in good faith, to, as promptly

Transferred Contract or Assumed Lease (x) for the assignment pursuant to the
Assignment and Assumption Agreement thereof to Buyer or a Designated Purchaser
or (y) otherwise to the extent required to effect the transfer or conveyance
thereof to Buyer or a Designated Purchaser pursuant to this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or (B) written confirmation from the
necessary person(s) employed by the applicable counterparty to such

consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to
making any accommodations, waivers, modifications or amendments if the effect
of such accommodations, waivers, modifications or amendments would reasonably
be expected to have a material and adverse economic impact on the commercial
relationship between the Business and the applicable customer.

 



 

(iii) Seller shall (or shall cause its Affiliates to) use reasonable best
efforts to deliver to the necessary employee(s) of the applicable counterparty
to such Transferred Contracts and Assumed Leases documentation, in form and

Designated Purchaser) on the other hand, shall enter into an assignment and
assumption agreement, in substantially the same form as the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement (to the extent related to the assignment and assumption
of Transferred Contracts), to effect the assignment and transfer of such
Transferred Contract or Assumed Lease to Buyer (or a Designated Purchaser).
Seller and Buyer shall keep such other party reasonably apprised of the status
of the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) Seller and/or its Affiliates may (but are not required to) make

such Transferred Contracts or Assumed Leases if the effect of such
accommodations, waivers, modifications or amendments would reasonably be
expected to have a material and adverse economic impact on the commercial
relationship between the Business and the applicable customer.

 



 

The parties acknowledge and agree that Sellers obligation to use "reasonable
best efforts" pursuant to this _Section 5.9(c)_ with regard to the assignment

transfer of Business Employees with (1) the title of Relationship Manager or
(2) responsible for management of the commercial relationship with the
counterparty to such Customer Contract to Buyer or its Affiliates in
accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Following the date hereof, and until (x) the transfer of the applicable
Transferred Contract or Assumed Lease contemplated by _Section 5.9(c)(i)_ or
(y) the Termination Date applicable thereto, without limiting the parties
obligations under _Section 5.9(c)_, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to
establish an agency relationship or other similar arrangement reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Buyer under which Buyer would obtain, as of the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent practicable and not prohibited by any
Law or any Contract to which Seller or its Affiliate and a Third Party are
bound, all of the claims, rights and benefits, and assume the corresponding
Liabilities and obligations under Transferred Contracts with suppliers or
vendors and under the Assumed Leases (it being understood that Transferred
Contracts with customers of the Business are addressed in _Section 5.9(c)_
and _Section 5.9(e)_ and Section 2.12.2 of the Transitional Services
Agreement) in accordance with this Agreement (including by means of any
subcontracting sublicensing or subleasing arrangement) or under which Seller
would enforce at the direction of and for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer
assuming and agreeing to pay Sellers or its applicable Affiliates
obligations and expenses, any and all claims, rights and benefits of Seller or
its applicable Affiliate against a Third Party thereto. In connection with
such arrangement, with respect to the period from and after the Effective
Time, (A) Seller will promptly pay, assign and remit to Buyer when received
(or, with respect to monies or other

 



     

 

 



 

consideration in respect of such Transferred Contract or Assumed Lease
received prior to the inception of such arrangement in respect of periods from
and after the Effective Time, then upon inception of such arrangement) all

arising thereunder or resulting therefrom) not otherwise transferred pursuant
to this _Section 5.9_ and (B) Buyer will promptly pay, perform or discharge
when due any Liability arising thereunder assumed pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)_. Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties (as defined
below) for all Losses arising out of any actions (or omissions to act) of
Seller or its Affiliates taken at the direction of Buyer or its Affiliates
with respect to such Transferred Contract or Assumed Lease in connection with
the arrangements contemplated by this _Section 5.9(d)_. Seller shall, at
Buyers expense, take all such actions and execute all such documents as

Transferred Contract or Assumed Lease as reasonably requested by Buyer in
fulfilling its obligations under this _Section 5.9(d)_.

 



 

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall remit to Buyer (or such of
Buyers Affiliates as Buyer may direct) all amounts received by or on behalf
of Seller or its Affiliates (i) in respect of periods at or after the
Effective Time under the Customer Contracts and the Participation Agreements
(to the extent contemplated by _Section 2.1(b)_), whether collected prior to,
at or after the Effective Time, (ii) in respect of the Accounts Receivable or

Deposits (net of amounts paid to customers) in respect of periods at or after

Assets (including the Delayed Transfer Purchased Assets) in respect of periods
at or after the Effective Time. Seller shall remit such amounts actually

of the month immediately following such month or as otherwise agreed by the
parties, except that any such amounts collected prior to the Closing in
respect of periods at or after the Effective Time shall be paid to Buyer on
the Closing Date. Promptly following the date hereof, the parties shall
cooperate in good faith to develop and agree upon the form, content, method
and frequency of delivery of reports to be prepared by Seller with respect to
amounts to be paid to Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section
5.9(e)_, and Seller shall commence providing such reports immediately
following the Closing. Seller shall permit Buyer, at Buyers expense, to audit
Sellers collection, calculation and payment of the amounts contemplated by
this _Section 5.9(e)_ in accordance with _Section 5.6(c)_.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.9_ to the contrary:

 



 

(i) Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall, subject to
_Section 5.9(f)(ii)_, each pay fifty percent (50%) of any and all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees in connection with obtaining any
consent, waiver or approval contemplated in this _Section 5.9_; it being
understood that no customer of the Business shall be charged a conversion or
"set up" fee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

financial or other accommodations in connection with obtaining any consent,
waiver or approval with respect to such Transferred Contracts or Assumed
Leases or making any accommodations, waivers, modifications or amendments to
such Transferred Contracts or Assumed Leases in order to obtain any such
required consent, waiver or approval.

 



 

(iii) The failure to obtain any consent, waiver or approval with respect to
any Transferred Contract or Assumed Lease, shall not (A) constitute a failure
to satisfy any condition set forth in _Article VI_ or (B) relieve Buyer from
its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(iv) Seller shall be entitled to terminate, in a manner permitted by Law and
the terms of the applicable Transferred Contract, any Transferred Contract or
Assumed Lease referred to in _Section 5.9(a)_ (or any claim, right, benefit
or Liability of Seller or its Affiliates arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom) at any time upon the earlier of (x) the date on which any
counterparty to such Transferred Contract or Assumed Lease, as applicable,
notifies Seller or Buyer in writing of its intent not to provide the requisite
consent, waiver or approval related to such Transferred Contract or Assumed
Lease contemplated by _Section 5.9(b)(i)_ or _Section 5.9(c)(i)_ (but in no
event earlier than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date) and (y)
January 1, 2020; _provided_ that in no event shall Seller or any of its
Affiliates deliver any notice of termination of any Customer Contract prior to
the date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date, unless otherwise
agreed by the parties. Seller may effect such termination by commencing a
proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to substitute Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer (if requested by Buyer) or another Person (if declined by
Buyer) as fiduciary for Seller or its Affiliates under Law. In the sole
discretion of Buyer, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer may join any such
proceeding as a party; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall provide all
assistance reasonably requested by Seller to cause Buyer or its applicable
Affiliate (if requested by Buyer) or another Person (if declined by Buyer) to
be substituted as fiduciary for Seller or its Affiliates with respect to such
Transferred Contract or Assumed Lease.

 



 

(g) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to procure any license, permit, consent or approval needed from a Third Party
in order for Seller to provide, or procure the provision of, any Service to
Buyer under the Transitional Services Agreement (a " **Third Party TSA
Consent** "). Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
Seller with such assistance as Seller may reasonably require in order to
obtain or maintain any Third Party TSA Consent, including assistance with
negotiating the terms of such consent with the relevant Third Party. All costs
and expenses incurred in connection with procuring any Third Party TSA Consent
shall be allocated as set forth in Section 5.9(g) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter.

 



 

 **Section 5.10** **_Further Assurances_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to, and not in limitation of, _Section 5.7_ and _Section 5.9_,
each of Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to,
(i) execute and deliver such documents and other papers and take such further
actions as may be reasonably required to carry

 



     

 

 



 

out the provisions of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements and

Ancillary Agreements, (ii) refrain from taking any actions that would
reasonably be expected to impair, delay or impede the Closing, (iii) cooperate
and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, no later than the Closing
Date, the consent, waiver or approval of any Third Party that may be or may
become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to be made or obtained (as
applicable) by Seller, Buyer or their respective Affiliates to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and (iv) without limiting the foregoing, use its
reasonable best efforts to cause all of the conditions to the obligations of
the other party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be met on or prior to the Outside Date.

 



 

(b) After the Closing, each of Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, use its or their reasonable best efforts, from time
to time, to execute and deliver, at the reasonable request of the other party,
such additional documents and instruments, including any assignment or
assumption agreements, bills of sale, instruments of assignment, consents and
other similar instruments in addition to those required by this Agreement, as
may be reasonably required to give effect to this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and to
provide any documents or other evidence of ownership as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer to confirm Buyers ownership of the Purchased Assets and
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

 **Section 5.11** **_Wrong Pockets_**.

 



 

(a) In the event that record or beneficial ownership or possession of any
property, right, agreement or asset that is not a Purchased Asset has been
assigned, conveyed or transferred by Seller or its Affiliates to Buyer or any
of its Affiliates on or after the Effective Time, Buyer shall, promptly
following Sellers request, use its (and shall cause its Affiliates to use
their) commercially reasonable efforts to assign, convey and transfer such
property, right, agreement or asset to Seller or its designated Affiliate (it
being understood that if any consent, waiver or approval of any Third Party
that has not been obtained (or lapse of statutory or contractual period to
object that has not occurred) is required, _Section 5.9_ (Consents) shall
apply). Pending such transfer to Seller or its designated Affiliate, Buyer
shall hold such property, right, agreement or asset and provide to Seller or
its designated Affiliate all of the benefits, rights, obligations and
liabilities associated with the ownership and operation of such property,
right, agreement or asset and, accordingly, Buyer shall cause such property,
right, agreement or asset to be operated or retained as may reasonably be
instructed by Seller, and Seller shall indemnify Buyer for the Losses
resulting from such operation or retention, so long as such operation or
retention by Buyer or its Affiliates are in accordance with Sellers
instructions, except that Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer for
any Losses arising from such operation or retention that are finally
judicially determined to have resulted primarily from Buyers or its
Affiliates willful misconduct or gross negligence.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.9_ and Section 2.12.2 of the Transitional Services
Agreement, in the event that record or beneficial ownership or possession of a

commercially reasonable efforts to assign, convey and

 



     

 

 



 

transfer such asset to Buyer or its designated Affiliate (it being understood
that if any consent, waiver or approval of any Third Party that has not been
obtained (or lapse of statutory or contractual period to object that has not
occurred) is required, _Section 5.9_ (Consents) or Section 2.12.2 of the
Transitional Services Agreement, as applicable, shall apply). Pending such
transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates, Seller shall hold such Purchased Asset
and provide to Buyer or its designated Affiliate all of the benefits, rights,
obligations and liabilities associated with the ownership and operation of
such Purchased Asset and, accordingly, Seller shall cause such Purchased Asset
to be operated or retained as may reasonably be instructed by Buyer, and Buyer
shall indemnify Seller or its Affiliates for the Losses resulting from such
operation or retention so long as such operation or retention are in
accordance with Buyers or its Affiliates instructions, except that Buyer
shall not be required to indemnify Seller for any Losses arising from such
operation or retention that are finally judicially determined to have resulted
primarily from Sellers or its Affiliates willful misconduct or gross
negligence.

obligation at the time of transmittal, upon notice of such from the disclosing
party, the receiving party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates and

extent such information is capable of being returned or destroyed) and (ii)
keep such information confidential in accordance with _Section 5.4_.

Transitional Services Agreement. The TSA Representatives shall be an assistant
vice president or more senior level employee in order to facilitate productive
meetings.

 



 

(i) Section 5.12(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth the name,

practice and will be on a "pass-through" cost basis.

 



 

(f) The parties agree that until a given Seller-Controlled Asset has been
transferred to Buyer or its Affiliates as set forth in this Agreement, such
Seller-Controlled Asset shall be operated in a manner consistent with Section
5.12(f) of the Seller Disclosure Letter and otherwise as mutually agreed by
Buyer and Seller. Commencing promptly after the date hereof, the parties shall
discuss in good faith and shall cooperate to agree on a governance plan to
provide a framework to resolve any disputes between the parties hereto with
respect to the operation of the Seller-Controlled Assets that have not yet

(the " **Governance Plan** ") as contemplated in Section 5.12(f) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter.

 



 

 **Section 5.13** **_Compliance with WARN Act_**. The parties hereto agree to
cooperate in good faith, including by sharing information about terminations
of employment in a timely manner, until ninety (90) days following the Hire
Date, to determine whether any notification may be required under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or any similar

Agreement becoming incapable of being satisfied.

 



 

(b) Seller shall be permitted to reference as an exception to the certificate
required to be delivered to Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)(iii)_, and
Buyer shall be permitted to reference as an exception to the certificate
required to be delivered to Seller pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)(iii)_, any
fact, change, condition, circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any
event that it has disclosed to the other party prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such exception will not affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ of
this Agreement, any condition set forth in _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ or _Section
6.2(a)(i)_, or any of the parties rights to indemnification hereunder
(pursuant to _Article VIII_ or otherwise).

 



 

 **Section 5.15** **_Intellectual Property Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) neither Buyer nor its
Affiliates are acquiring, and the Purchased Assets do not include any right,
title or interest in or to, or right to use, any (A) Wells Fargo Marks or (B)
other Wells Fargo Retained IP and (ii) prior to and following the Effective
Time, none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall have any right, title or
interest in or to, or right to use, and Buyer covenants that it and its
Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, in its use of the Purchased
Assets or otherwise) will not hereafter adopt, use, apply to register or
register, or authorize others to adopt, use, apply to register or register,
any (A) Wells Fargo Marks, except as expressly set forth in _Section 5.15(b)_
or (B) other Wells Fargo Retained IP, except as expressly set forth in the
Transitional Services Agreement, in _Section 5.15(f)_ or as otherwise agreed
by the parties.

 



 

(b) Buyer and its Affiliates may, solely in its or their use of the Purchased
Assets, utilize materials and assets (including stationery, forms, business
cards and other similar items) that bear the Wells Fargo Marks as of the
Closing Date for the periods set forth in this Section. Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, remove, strike over, or otherwise obliterate all
Wells Fargo Marks from all such assets and materials, within thirty (30) days
after, (i) with respect to customer-facing materials (such as statements,
Software and interfaces to software), the date on which the Software platform
used to service the products provided to such customers (or potential
customers) is migrated to Buyer or its designee pursuant to the Transitional
Services Agreement, (ii) with respect to other Purchased Assets, the date on
which such Purchased Asset is transferred to Buyer or its designee, or (iii)
such later date as may be consented to in writing by Seller (such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer and its Affiliates may retain such assets and materials
with Wells Fargo Marks for internal, non-promotional archival purposes, to
indicate the historic affiliation of the Business with Seller or otherwise to
the extent required by applicable document retention policies. Any use by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates under this _Section 5.15(b)_ of any materials
and assets that bear the Wells Fargo Marks is subject to the use of such
materials and assets in a form and manner, and with standards of quality, as
in effect for such materials, assets and Wells Fargo Marks as of the Closing
Date. None of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall use the Wells Fargo Marks
in a manner that may reflect negatively on the Wells Fargo Marks or on Seller
or its Affiliates. Seller may terminate the foregoing license, effective
immediately, if Buyer or any of its Affiliates fails to promptly comply with
the foregoing terms and conditions or

 



     

 

 



 

any reasonable direction of Seller or one of its Affiliates in relation to the
use of the Wells Fargo Marks. Following the Effective Time, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, not hold itself out as having any affiliation
with Seller or any of its Affiliates. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that the remedy at Law for any breach of the requirements of this
_Section 5.15(b)_ would be inadequate and agrees and consents that without
intending to limit any additional remedies that may be available, Seller and
its Affiliates shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof
and immediate injunctive relief and other equitable relief, without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the
parties hereto further hereby agree to waive any requirement for the securing
or posting of bond or other undertaking, in any action which may be brought to
enforce any of the provisions of this _Section 5.15(b)_.

 



 

(c) Prior to using any materials and assets that bear the Wells Fargo Marks as
permitted under _Section 5.15(b)_, Buyer and its Affiliates shall, at their
sole cost and expense and in a form acceptable to Seller, notify customers of
the Business (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Buyer and its Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates for all Losses arising from or relating to the matters described in
this _Section 5.15_, including the use by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of
the Wells Fargo Marks (and materials and assets that bear the Wells Fargo
Marks) pursuant to _Section 5.15(b)_.

 



 

(e) Subject to the terms of this _Section 5.15(e)_, Buyer hereby grants, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, to Seller and its Affiliates, effective
as of the Effective Time, a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, irrevocable,
worldwide, perpetual right and license to use, reproduce, store, distribute,
communicate, copy, modify, display, transmit and create derivative works of
the Business IP (excluding any rights in Trademarks) for any and all purposes
following the Effective Time. Seller and its Affiliates shall not have any
rights to any enhancements, improvements or other modifications to the
Business IP made by or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates after the
Effective Time, and neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall have any rights to
any enhancements, improvements or other modifications to the Business IP made
by or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates after the Effective Time. All use
of the Business IP by or under authority of Seller or its Affiliates (or their
successors and assigns) from and after the Effective Time shall be on an "AS
IS, WHERE IS" basis, with all faults and all express and implied
representations and warranties disclaimed, and at their sole risk. The license
to the Business IP granted under this _Section 5.15(e)_ shall be
sublicensable to Third Party service providers of Seller or its Affiliates,
and shall be assignable and transferable to successors in interest to all or a
portion of the businesses of Seller or its Affiliates, in each case without
the prior written consent of Buyer.

 



 

(f) Subject to the terms of this _Section 5.15(f)_, Seller hereby grants, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, to Buyer and its Affiliates, effective as
of the Effective Time, a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, irrevocable, worldwide,
perpetual right and license to use, reproduce, store, distribute, communicate,
copy, modify, display, transmit and create derivative works of, for any and
all purposes, solely in connection with the Business, any Wells Fargo Retained
IP that is reasonably necessary for the conduct of the Business following the

Letter)).

 



 

(b) The obligation of Buyer to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for
Losses is subject to the following limitations: (i) Buyer shall not be

and then the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
for only the amount in excess of the Deductible, (ii) in no event shall the
aggregate amount of Losses for which Buyer is obligated to indemnify Seller
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect

or warranty of Buyer in this Agreement, and the amount of any Losses under

disregarded.

 



 

 **Section 8.3** **_Indemnification Procedures_**.

 



 

(a) In the event that any action, claim, investigation, suit or arbitration is
threatened in writing or commenced by a Third Party involving any action,
claim, investigation, suit or arbitration for which a party may be required to
provide indemnity (an " **Indemnifying Party** ") pursuant to this Agreement
(other than pursuant to _Section 9.1_, which shall be handled in accordance
with _Article IX_) to any other party hereto (an " **Indemnified Party** ")
(an " **Asserted Liability** "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify
(but in any event within fifteen (15) days of the Indemnified Party first
receiving such written threat or notice of commencement of such action, claim,
investigation, suit or arbitration by a Third Party, or such shorter period of
time within which a response or action may be required or advisable by counsel
(taking into account the Indemnifying Partys reasonably required time to
prepare such response or action)) the Indemnifying Party of such Asserted
Liability in a writing that (i) describes such Asserted Liability in
reasonable detail (including the facts underlying each particular claim (or
series of substantially similar or related claims if it would reasonably be
unduly burdensome to provide such information for each particular claim) and
an identification of each section of this Agreement pursuant to which
indemnification is being sought); (ii) attaches copies of any material written
evidence upon which such Asserted Liability is based (it being understood
that, to the extent that such written evidence is not reasonably available at
such time, the Indemnified Party shall so indicate, and shall promptly provide
such evidence when it becomes available); and (iii) sets forth the Indemnified
Partys good faith estimate (based on information then known by the
Indemnified Party) of the amount (broken down by each individual claim or
series of substantially similar (or related claims if it would reasonably be
unduly burdensome to provide such information for each particular claim)) for
which the Indemnified Party may be liable (the " **Claim Notice** "); except
that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving any Claim Notice
shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation
hereunder unless (and then only to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is
materially damaged or prejudiced by such delay (in which case the Indemnifying
Party shall be relieved only of any portion of the indemnification obligation
hereunder that resulted from such delay). The Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) days from its receipt of a Claim Notice that complies with the
requirements set forth herein (the " **Notice Period** ") to notify the
Indemnified Party whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying
Partys sole cost and expense and with counsel of its own choosing, to assume
and control the defense of an Asserted Liability; _provided_ that in no event
may the Indemnifying Party assume control of the defense of an Asserted
Liability involving criminal liability or in which injunctive or other non-
monetary relief against the Indemnified Party is the sole relief sought
against the Indemnified Party, unless the Indemnifying Party could also be
subject to criminal liability or injunctive or non-monetary relief thereunder,
in which case the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party may each retain
its own counsel at its own cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party
undertakes to assume and control the defense of an Asserted Liability, the
Indemnifying Party shall (A) not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), consent to any settlement that (w) does not contain a full and final
release of the Indemnified Party from the

 



     

 

 



 

subject matter of such Asserted Liability and settlement, (x) provides for
injunctive or other non-monetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party in any
way, (y) provides for payment of any money damages that, together with any
other Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified
Parties (as the case may be) and indemnifiable pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (as the case may be), would exceed the Cap
or (z) includes an express admission of any violation of Law by any
Indemnified Party, and (B) have the sole right to control the defense of any
Asserted Liability, including the appointment, removal or replacement of
counsel at its sole discretion, and the filing (at its reasonable discretion)
of any counterclaim as part of a defense strategy. The party not in control of
the defense of an Asserted Liability shall fully cooperate with the other
party and its counsel in the investigation, defense and settlement of such
Asserted Liability, including promptly (w) executing and delivering documents,
(x) procuring potential witnesses and witness statements, (y) furnishing
documentary evidence to the extent available to it or its Affiliates and (z)
providing access to any other relevant party, including any employees or
agents of, or advisors to, the parties as reasonably needed, to ensure the
proper and adequate defense of such Asserted Liability. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, other than any Asserted Liability under which the Indemnifying
Party could be subject to criminal liability or injunctive or non-monetary
relief, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle any Asserted
Liability in accordance with _Section 8.3(b)_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall have undertaken to defend only if (I) as part of such settlement, the
Indemnified Party unconditionally and irrevocably releases the Indemnifying
Party from any and all Liabilities as part of any such settlement, including
any right to indemnification by the Indemnifying Party with respect to the
Asserted Liability, or (II) the Indemnifying Party provides its prior written
consent to such settlement (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding an election by the Indemnifying Party
to assume and control the defense of such Asserted Liability, (1) the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate legal counsel, at
the expense of the Indemnified Party, and to participate in the defense of
such Asserted Liability, and (2) if, and only if, there exists a material
conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party, except that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
obligated to pay costs, fees or expenses of more than one separate counsel for
all Indemnified Parties, taken together.

 



 

(b) To the extent the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend an Asserted
Liability, (ii) does not undertake to assume and control the defense against
an Asserted Liability within the Notice Period or (iii) fails to contest in
good faith the Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel
and control the investigation and defense of the Asserted Liability at the
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party and may take any other actions the
Indemnified Party deems reasonably advisable without in any way waiving or
otherwise affecting the Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification pursuant
to this Agreement; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to participate in any such defense at its sole cost and expense; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not consent to any settlement of
an Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). In any event, the Indemnified Party and its counsel shall keep the
Indemnifying Party informed of all developments relating to any such Asserted
Liability, including by promptly providing copies of all relevant
correspondence and documentation relating thereto.

 



      

 

 



 

(c) In the event that any Indemnified Party has a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ for Losses not involving a claim
by a Third Party that such Indemnified Party believes gives rise to a claim
for indemnification in accordance with the terms hereunder, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such Losses in a writing
that meets the requirements set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_, except that no
delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving any notice pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(c)_ shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
indemnification obligation hereunder unless (and then only to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party is materially damaged or prejudiced by such delay (in which
case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved only of any portion of the
indemnification obligation hereunder that resulted from such delay).

 



 

(d) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the amount of any
indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss
for which an indemnification claim has been made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement and shall be computed net of (i) payments actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect to
such Losses (after giving effect to any deductible or other reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket cost of recovery) and (ii) any other amount actually
recovered previously by the Indemnified Party from any Third Party with
respect to such Losses.

 



 

(e) The parties hereto are in agreement that where one and the same set of
facts qualifies under more than one provision entitling an Indemnified Party
to a claim or remedy under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall not be
entitled to duplicative recovery of Losses arising out of such facts. In
particular, the foregoing shall apply if one and the same set of facts would
entitle Buyer to rights under this _Article VIII_ and a Purchase Price
adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.10_. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge
and agree that no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any recovery
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ for a Loss to the extent the amount of such
Loss has been included in the calculation of the Post-Closing Adjustment
pursuant to _Section 2.10_.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ to the extent any Losses were attributable to such Indemnified Partys
own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 



 

(g) To the extent that an Indemnifying Party makes any payment pursuant to
this _Article VIII_ in respect of Losses for which an Indemnified Party has a
right to recover against a Third Party (including any insurance company in its
capacity as an insurer), such Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek recovery from such Third Party on such Indemnifying
Partys behalf, and at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense (for
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses), and pay the
amount of any such recovery to such Indemnifying Party (after deducting
therefrom the amount of any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs of
recovery incurred by such Indemnified Party in pursuing or defending any claim
arising out of such matter to the extent not previously reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party); _provided_ that such payment to the Indemnifying Party
shall not exceed of the sum of (i) any amount previously paid by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of any
claim arising out of such matter(s) and (ii) any

 



     

 

 



 

out-of-pocket costs and expenses expended by the Indemnifying Party in
pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter(s).

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall the aggregate liability of Seller and its Affiliates under _Section
8.1(a)(i)_, _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_ and _Section 9.1(a)_ of this Agreement,
Section 2.12 of the Transitional Services Agreement and the Sweep Deposit and
Servicing Agreement (to the extent provided therein), be greater than the Base
Purchase Price.

 



 

(i) Any amount owed to the Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party after
any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration
board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the time in which
to appeal therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall have been consummated
in accordance with this _Section 8.3_, or the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall arrive at a written mutually binding agreement with
respect to any matter alleged to be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party
hereunder, shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Indemnified Party shall have
delivered to the Indemnifying Party written notice of any sums due and owing
to it with respect to each such matter.

 



 

 **Section 8.4** **_Sole Remedy_**. After the Closing, the provisions of
_Article VIII_ and _Article IX_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy of the parties hereto against each other with respect to (a)
any breach or non-fulfillment of any representation, warranty, agreement,
covenant, condition or any other obligation contained in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements (other than the Transitional Services Agreement and the
Sweep Deposit and Servicing Agreement) and (b) any indemnification obligations
set forth in _Section 5.9(b)_, _Section 5.11(a)_, _Section 5.11(b)_,
_Section 5.13_ and _Section 5.15(d)_, except for (i) Fraud, (ii) pursuant to
_Section 10.14_ and (iii) matters covered by _Section 2.10_ (to which this
_Article VIII_ and _Article IX_ shall not apply).

 



 

 **Section 8.5** **_Mitigation_**. Each Indemnified Party shall, at the
Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Loss upon and after obtaining knowledge of any event
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Loss. In the event that
an Indemnified Party shall fail to use such commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any such Loss, then, notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to
indemnify any Indemnified Party for that portion of any Losses that could
reasonably be expected to have been avoided if such Indemnified Party had made
such efforts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.5_,
no Indemnified Party shall have any obligation to assert any claim or exercise
any other right of recovery against any customer, vendor or supplier of the
Business or any of the Excluded Businesses in order to mitigate Losses
hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 8.6** **_Damages Limitation_**. In no event shall Seller, Buyer or
their respective Affiliates be liable under this _Article VIII_ for any (a)
punitive or exemplary damages, except to the extent paid to a Third Party, or
(b) consequential damages or lost profits, except for consequential damages
and lost profits to the extent they were the reasonably foreseeable result of
the event, matter and/or breach that gave rise thereto.

 



     

 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 ** _TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

 **Section 9.1** **_Tax Indemnification_**.

 



 

(a) Seller shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold the Buyer
Indemnified Parties harmless from and against (without duplication) (i) any
Taxes attributable to or imposed on the Purchased Assets or the Business with
respect to any taxable period ending before the Effective Time, and the
portion of any Straddle Period ending before the Effective Time (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing
Reorganization) (a " **Pre-Closing Tax Period** "), (ii) Transfer Taxes borne
by Seller pursuant to _Section 9.3_, (iii) any breach of any of the
representations or warranties of Seller in _Section 3.9_; _provided_ that
Seller shall not indemnify or hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless
from, against, or in respect of, any Taxes attributable to or relating to any
Post-Closing Tax Period (as defined herein) and (iv) any Retained Liability
that is a Tax Liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be
responsible for and shall not indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties
harmless from or against any Taxes related to any action outside the ordinary
course with respect to the Purchased Assets or the recordkeeping, trust and
custody and discretionary business of Buyer and its Affiliates after the
Effective Time on the Closing Date by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other
than any such action expressly required or permitted by this Agreement or
required by Law) (a " **Buyer Tax Act** ").

 



 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold the Seller
Indemnified Parties harmless from and against (without duplication) (i) any
Taxes attributable to or imposed on the Purchased Assets or the recordkeeping,
trust and custody and discretionary business of Buyer and its Affiliates with
respect to any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date and the portion
of any Straddle Period beginning at or after the Effective Time (a " **Post-
Closing Tax Period** "), (ii) Transfer Taxes borne by Buyer pursuant to
_Section 9.3_ and (iii) any Taxes attributable to a Buyer Tax Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be responsible for and shall
not indemnify and hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from or against
any Taxes for which Seller is responsible under _Section 9.1(a)_.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this _Section 9.1_, in the case of Taxes that are payable
with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is
allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be: in
the case of Taxes (i) that are either (A) based upon or related to income or
receipts or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended on (and
included) the Closing Date, and (ii) imposed on a periodic basis without
regard to income, receipts, payroll or sales with respect to the
recordkeeping, trust and custody and discretionary business or the Purchased
Assets, deemed to be the entire amount of such Taxes for the entire period,
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
in the period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

 



 

(d) Whenever in accordance with this _Section 9.1_ Seller shall be required
to pay Buyer an amount pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ or Buyer shall be
required to pay Seller an

 



     

 

 



 

amount pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_, such payments shall be made by the later
of thirty (30) days after such payments are requested or ten (10) days before
the requesting party is required to pay the related Tax liability.

 



 

 **Section 9.2** **_Tax Returns_**.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise required by Law, Seller shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and shall file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns with respect
to the Purchased Assets for any taxable period which ends on or prior to the
Closing Date. Except as otherwise required by Law, Buyer shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns with
respect to the Purchased Assets for taxable periods ending after the Closing
Date; _provided_ that, with respect to any such Tax Returns for a Straddle
Period, such Tax Returns shall be prepared and all elections with respect to
such Tax Returns shall be made, to the extent permitted by Law, in a manner
consistent with past practice. Before filing any Tax Return with respect to
any Straddle Period, Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of such Tax Return
at least thirty (30) days prior to the last date for timely filing such Tax
Return (giving effect to any valid extensions thereof) (or, for any Tax Return
that is due within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, as soon as
practicable prior to such last date for timely filing such Tax Return)
accompanied by a statement calculating in reasonable detail Sellers
indemnification obligation, if any, pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_. If for any
reason Seller does not agree with Buyers calculation of its indemnification
obligation, Seller shall notify Buyer of its disagreement within fifteen (15)
Business Days of receiving a copy of the Tax Return and Buyers calculation.
If the parties hereto are unable to resolve any dispute prior to the due date
of such Tax Return (giving effect to valid extensions), Buyer shall file the
Tax Return as originally prepared (but, reflecting any items on which the
parties hereto have agreed) and shall later amend such Tax Return if necessary
following the resolution of such dispute pursuant to the method set forth in
_Section 9.6_. If Seller agrees with Buyers calculation of its
indemnification obligation, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of Sellers
indemnification at the time specified in _Section 9.1(d)_.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall not amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return with
respect to the Purchased Assets or the recordkeeping, trust and custody and
discretionary business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period
without the prior written consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, unless otherwise required by Law.

 



 

 **Section 9.3** **_Transfer Taxes_**. All Tax Returns with respect to
Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with or as a consequence of the transfer
of the Purchased Assets shall be timely filed by the party hereto responsible
for such filing under Law, and all such Transfer Taxes (and all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs for preparation of such Tax Returns) shall be borne by
Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate any
Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by Law. If Seller pays a Transfer Tax
at the Closing or pursuant to a post-Closing assessment by any Governmental
Entity, Buyer will reimburse Seller for the amount of such Transfer Tax within
ten (10) days of Sellers written demand therefor.

 



 

 **Section 9.4** **_Tax Contests_**. Buyer or Seller shall promptly notify
the other party hereto in writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax audits, examinations or assessments which, if successful, could
result in an indemnity payment pursuant to _Sections_

 



     

 

 



 

 _9.1(a)_ or _9.1(b)_ (a " **Tax Claim** "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
control any Tax Claim. If the Indemnifying Party chooses not to control such
Tax Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend the same in such manner as it may
deem appropriate and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in such Tax Claim. The party hereto controlling a Tax Claim shall
in any event keep the other party hereto informed of the progress of such Tax
Claim and consult with such other party as to the resolution of any issue that
would materially affect such other party, shall promptly provide such other
party with copies of all material documents (including material notices,
protests, briefs, written rulings and determinations and correspondence)
pertaining to such Tax Claim, shall not settle such Tax Claim without such
other partys advance written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and shall otherwise permit such other party
to participate in all aspects of such Tax Claim, at such other partys own
expense. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be entitled to control in
all respects, and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to
participate in or have consent rights with respect to, the defense of any Tax
Claim that relates to any income Taxes of Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

 **Section 9.5** **_Refunds_**.

 



 

(a) Seller shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (including any interest in
respect thereof) that are received by Buyer and any amounts credited against
Tax to which Buyer becomes entitled to, and utilizes (including by way of any
amended Tax Returns), that (i) are attributable to the Purchased Assets for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (ii) relate to the recordkeeping, trust and
custody and discretionary business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer
shall pay to Seller the amount of any such refund or credit within fifteen
(15) days after receipt of such refund or utilization of such credit. Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate in obtaining any refund
that Seller reasonably believes should be available, including through filing
appropriate amended Tax Returns with the applicable Tax Authorities.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (including any interest in
respect thereof) that are received by Seller and any amounts credited against
Tax to which Seller becomes entitled to, and utilizes (including by way of any
amended Tax Returns), that (i) are attributable to the Purchased Assets for
any Post-Closing Tax Period or (ii) relate to the recordkeeping, trust and
custody and discretionary business for any Post-Closing Tax Period, and Seller
shall pay to Buyer the amount of any such refund or credit within fifteen (15)
days after receipt of such refund or utilization of such credit. Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate in obtaining any refund that
Buyer reasonably believes should be available, including through filing
appropriate amended Tax Returns with the applicable Tax Authorities.

 



 

 **Section 9.6** **_Resolution of All Tax Related Disputes_**. Except as
otherwise provided, with respect to any dispute or a disagreement relating to
Taxes among the parties hereto, the parties hereto shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve such dispute between them; but if the parties hereto are
unable to resolve such dispute, the parties hereto shall submit the dispute to
the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution, which resolution shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The costs, fees and
expenses relating to any dispute as to the amount of Taxes owed by any of the
parties hereto shall be paid by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, in proportion to each such partys respective liability for the
portion of

 



     

 

 



 

the Taxes in dispute, as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm. In all
other cases, costs fees and expenses shall be shared equally by Seller and
Buyer.

 



 

 **Section 9.7** **_Cooperation, Exchange of Information and Record
Retention_**.

 



 

(a) Buyer and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates,
on the other hand, shall cooperate and (at the expense of the requesting party
with respect to out-of-pocket costs) provide to each other such information
and assistance as may reasonably be requested in connection with the (i)
preparation of any Tax Return relating to the Business, (ii) conduct of any
audit or other examination by any Tax Authority relating to any liability for
Taxes relating to the Business, and (iii) prosecution or defense of any
action, claim, investigation, suit or arbitration relating to any Tax Return
relating to the Business. Such cooperation shall include making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



 

(b) Seller and Buyer agree that, with respect to any income or payment subject
to reporting or withholding occurring prior to (i) the Effective Time and (ii)
in the case of any Customer Contract for which the required consent has not
been obtained, and that becomes subject to _Section 5.9(c)_, as of the
Effective Time, the time that such Customer Contract becomes a Transferred
Contract (if at all) (each such time, the " **Delayed Transfer Time** "),
Seller shall be responsible for (x) the filing of any tax return (including
Forms 941, 945 and 1042), information returns (including Forms 1099-B,
1099-DIV, 1099-INT, 1099-MISC, 1099-OID, 1099-R, 480.7C, W-2 and 1042-S) or
withholding tax deposit coupons, and (y) the withholding and remittance of Tax
to each appropriate Tax Authority, and the mailing of any related payee
statement or notice. Buyer shall be responsible for such filings with respect
to any income or payment with respect to the Purchased Assets subject to
reporting or withholding occurring at or after the Effective Time or the
Delayed Transfer Time, as applicable.

 



 

 **Section 9.8** **_Conflict and Survival_**. The covenants and agreements of
the parties hereto set forth in this _Article IX_ and the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.9_ shall survive until sixty (60) days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the relevant
Pre-Closing Tax Period (giving effect to valid extensions). This _Article
IX_, together with _Sections 8.3(h)_ and _8.4_ above, shall exclusively
govern all indemnification claims with respect to Taxes.

 



 

 **Section 9.9** **_Adjustment to Purchase Price_**. For all Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law, any payment by Buyer or Seller made under
_Article VIII_ or this _Article IX_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X**

 



 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

 



 

 **Section 10.1** **_Survival_**.

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ and
_Article IV_, and the right to commence any claim with respect thereto, shall
survive the Effective Time and terminate on the date that is fifteen (15)
months after the Closing Date, except that the

 



     

 

 



 

Fundamental Representations shall survive the Effective Time and shall
terminate on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) All covenants and agreements contained herein which by their terms are to
be performed, in whole or in part, after the Closing or which prohibit actions
subsequent to the Closing, shall survive the Effective Time in accordance with
their terms. The covenants and agreements referred to in _Section 9.8_ shall
survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations for the relevant Pre-Closing Tax Period (giving effect to valid
extensions). All other covenants and agreements contained herein shall survive
the Effective Time and terminate on the date that is six (6) months after the
Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Any claim for indemnity under this Agreement with respect to any breach of
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements not made within the
periods specified in _Section 10.1(a)_ and _Section 10.1(b)_ shall be deemed
time-barred, and no such claim shall be made after the periods specified in
_Section 10.1(a)_ and _Section 10.1(b)_, except that if written notice of a
claim for indemnification under _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.2(a)_ shall
have been provided to Seller or Buyer in accordance with _Section 8.3(a)_ or
_Section 8.3(c)_, as the case may be, within the applicable survival period
and in good faith, then any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements that are the subject of such indemnification claim that would
otherwise terminate as set forth above shall survive as to such claim until
such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

 



 

(d) Following the termination of a representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement in accordance with the preceding clauses (a) through (c) of this
_Section 10.1_, no Action may be initiated by any Indemnified Party with
respect thereto, regardless of any statute of limitations period that would
otherwise apply.

 



 

 **Section 10.2** **_Assignment; Binding Effect_**. This Agreement and the
rights and obligations hereunder are not assignable by either party hereto
unless such assignment is consented to in writing by the other party hereto;
_provided_ that Seller or Buyer may, without the consent of Seller or Buyer,
as applicable, assign any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder, to
any of its Affiliates (although no such assignment shall relieve Seller or
Buyer of its obligations hereunder); _provided_ that, in either case, such
assignment would not reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay or
prevent receipt of any action, consent, approval, license or waiver required
from any applicable Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements on a timely basis,
and subject to the preceding clause, this Agreement and all the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

 **Section 10.3** **_Choice of Law_**. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York applicable
to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, without
regard to the conflict of laws principles of such State (other than Section
5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law).

 



 

 **Section 10.4** **_Bulk Sales Law_**. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably waives compliance by any other party hereto with the provisions of
"bulk sales," "bulk transfer" or

 



     

 

 



 

similar Laws of any state within the United States or any foreign jurisdiction
that may otherwise be applicable with respect to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

 **Section 10.5** **_Jurisdiction and Service of Process_**. With respect to
any Action resulting from, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York or, if such court will not accept jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of
the State of New York or any court of competent civil jurisdiction sitting in
New York County, New York. In any such Action, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise (a) any claim that it is not subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts, (b) that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution in any such Action in the above-named
courts, (c) that such Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, (d) that the
venue of such Action is improper, and (e) that such Action should be
transferred or removed to any court other than one of the above-named courts,
or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other proceeding in any
other court other than one of the above-named courts, or that this Agreement
or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of
the parties hereto hereby agrees not to commence any such Action other than
before one of the above-named courts. Each of the parties hereto also hereby
agrees that any final and non-appealable judgment against a party hereto in
connection with any such Action shall be conclusive and binding on such party
and that such judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction,
either within or outside of the United States. A certified or exemplified copy
of such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount
of such award or judgment. With respect to any Action for which it has
submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to this _Section 10.5_, each party hereto
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for the
giving of notices pursuant to _Section 10.6_ of this Agreement. Nothing in
this _Section 10.5_ shall affect the right of either party hereto to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law. The foregoing consent to
jurisdiction shall not (i) constitute submission to jurisdiction or general
consent to service of process in the State of New York for any purpose except
with respect to any Action resulting from, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or (ii) be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the
respective parties to this Agreement.

reader of such disclosure who is familiar with the contents of this Agreement
and the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 



 

 **Section 10.12** **_Waiver and Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented only by a written instrument executed and delivered
by the parties hereto. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of either party hereto to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the parties hereto entitled to
the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party or
parties hereto granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligations, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.

 



 

 **Section 10.13** **_Third-Party Beneficiaries_**. This Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns,
and nothing herein express or implied shall give or be construed to give to
any Person, other than the parties hereto and such permitted successors and
assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 10.14** **_Specific Performance_**. The parties hereto hereby
expressly recognize and acknowledge that immediate, extensive and irreparable
damage would result, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would
be difficult to determine in the event that any provision of this Agreement is
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breached. It
is hereby agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof and immediate injunctive relief and other
equitable relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy, and the parties hereto further hereby agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of a bond or other undertaking in
connection with the obtaining of such injunctive or other equitable relief.
Such remedies, and any and all other remedies provided for in this Agreement,
shall, however, be cumulative in nature and not exclusive and shall be in
addition to any other remedies whatsoever which either party hereto may
otherwise have. Each of the parties hereto hereby acknowledges that the
existence of any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement does not diminish
the availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any
other injunctive relief. The parties hereto further agree not to (a) oppose
the granting, or raise any objection to the availability or granting, of the
equitable remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief for any
reason or on any basis or (b) assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
(i) unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable on the basis that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any breach of
this Agreement or (ii) not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges and agrees that
injunctive relief and/or specific performance will not cause an undue hardship
to such party.

 



      

 

 



 

 **Section 10.15** **_Severability_**. If any provision of this Agreement or
the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision hereof. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as
to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as
is enforceable.

 



 

 **Section 10.16** **_Negotiation of Agreement_**. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by independent counsel of its choice
throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and that it has executed the same with consent
and upon the advice of said independent counsel. Each such party and its
counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and other documents referred to herein, and any and all
drafts relating thereto shall be deemed the work product of the parties hereto
and may not be construed against either party hereto by reason of its
preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against the party
hereto that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.
The provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a reasonable manner
to effect the intentions of the parties hereto and this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.17** **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed, shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same
instrument binding upon each of the parties hereto notwithstanding the fact
that all parties hereto are not signatory to the original or the same
counterpart. For purposes of this Agreement, pdf signatures shall be deemed
originals.

 



 

 **Section 10.18** **_Waiver of Jury Trial_**. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED
BY LAW, THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT
ASSERT, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING
IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY
FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE
KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO
IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER
BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS.
