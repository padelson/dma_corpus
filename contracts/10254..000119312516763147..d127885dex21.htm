claims or suits pending or, to the Knowledge of Bold and Bold Sub, threatened
(a) alleging that any of Bolds or Bold Subs conduct, products or services
infringe in any material respect upon any Intellectual Property of any third
party, or (b) challenging any of Bolds or Bold Subs ownership of, right to
use, or the validity or enforcement of any material license or other material
agreement relating to Bolds or Bold Subs Intellectual Property. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the

encumbrance on, the rights of either Bold or Bold Sub with respect to any
material Intellectual Property owned or used by them.

COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

 

Section 6.1 _Access_.

 

(a) From and after the Execution Date until the Closing, upon reasonable
notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
afford to the other Parties and their respective Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to (and, with respect to books and
records, the right to copy) all of its and its Subsidiaries properties,
commitments, books, contracts, records and correspondence (in each case,
whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives, in each case, to the
extent reasonably related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and including for the purpose of conducting environmental due diligence,
provided that no subsurface or other invasive testing or sampling of any
property of any Party or its Subsidiaries may be conducted without such
Partys prior written approval. Each Party shall furnish promptly to each
other Party (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or
submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
laws and a copy of any communication (including "comment letters") received by
such Party from the SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii)
all other

 



-25-  information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and
personnel as the other Parties may reasonably request. Except for disclosures
permitted by the terms of this Agreement, each Party and its Representatives
shall hold information received from each other Party pursuant to this
_Section_ _ _ _6.1_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of _Section_ _
_ _6.3(b)_.

 

(b) This _Section_ _ _ _6.1_ shall not require any Party to permit any
access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith
judgment of such Party would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any
violation of any contract or applicable Law to which such Party or its
Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause any privilege (including
attorney-client privilege) that such Party or any of its Subsidiaries would be
entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such information and such
undermining of such privilege could in such Partys good faith judgment
adversely affect in any material respect such Partys position in any pending
or, what such Party believes in good faith could be, future litigation or (ii)
if such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of
the other Parties or any of their Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in a litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent
thereto; provided, however, that, in the case of _clause (i)_ , the Parties
shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information (including by entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement)
to the extent doing so (1) would not (in the good faith belief of the Party
being requested to disclose the information) reasonably be likely to result
in the violation of any such contract or applicable Law or reasonably be
likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such
information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Party
being requested to disclose the information) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which appropriately designated
Representatives of the other Parties shall be provided access to such
information; provided, further that the Party being requested to disclose the
information shall (x) notify the other Parties that such disclosures are
reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any
such contract or applicable Law or are reasonably likely to cause such
privilege to be undermined, (y) communicate to the other Parties in reasonable
detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject matter of
such information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance with the
first proviso in this _Section_ _ _ _6.1(b)_ ) and (z) in the case where such
disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek
consent from the applicable third party to any such contract with respect to
the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such contract). 

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section_ _
_ _6.1_ will modify any of the representations and warranties of the Parties.

Section 6.2 _Government Reviews_. In a timely manner, the Parties shall
(a) make all required filings, prepare all required applications and conduct
negotiations with each Governmental Body as to which such filings,
applications or negotiations are necessary or appropriate in the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) provide such information as
each may reasonably request to make such filings, prepare such applications
and conduct such negotiations. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with and
use reasonable efforts to assist the other with respect to such filings,
applications, and negotiations.

Section 6.3 _No Solicitation by Earthstone; Etc_.

(a) Except as otherwise permitted hereunder, Earthstone shall not, and
shall cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, facilitate, encourage or induce any inquiries or any proposals that
constitute the submission of an Alternative Proposal, (ii)
furnish confidential information or enter into any confidentiality agreement,
merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, stock purchase
agreement, asset purchase agreement or exchange agreement, option agreement or
other similar agreement relating to an Alternative Proposal (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iii) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Bold, the
Earthstone Board Recommendation or publicly recommend the approval or
adoption of, or publicly approve or adopt, or propose to publicly recommend,
approve or adopt, any Alternative Proposal (the taking of any action described
in clause (iii) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by Earthstones Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section 6.3_ by Earthstone.

 



-26- (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.3(a)_
, if at any time prior to obtaining the Earthstone Stockholder Approval, (i)
Earthstone has received an Alternative Proposal that the Earthstone Special
Committee believes is bona fide, (ii) the Earthstone Special Committee,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that such Alternative Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal and (iii)
such Alternative Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_
, then Earthstone may (A) furnish information, including confidential
information, with respect to Earthstone and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Alternative Proposal, and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such Alternative Proposal; provided that Earthstone
will not, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
not to, disclose any non-public information to such Person unless Earthstone
has, or first enters into, a confidentiality agreement with such Person with
confidentiality and standstill provisions that are not less restrictive to
such Person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Bold.

 

(c) In addition to the other obligations of Earthstone set forth in this
_Section 6.3_ , Earthstone shall promptly advise Bold, orally and in writing,
and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt, if any
proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
with, Earthstone in respect of any Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any
such notice to Bold, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal,
offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals
or offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with
such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such
Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter
shall promptly keep Bold informed of all material developments affecting the
status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and
Earthstone shall promptly provide Bold with copies of any additional written
materials received by Earthstone or that Earthstone has delivered to any
third party making an Alternative Proposal that relate to such proposals,
offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Earthstone receives a written
Alternative Proposal that the Earthstone Special Committee believes is bona
fide and the Earthstone Special Committee, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, concludes that such Alternative
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Earthstone
Special Committee may, at any time prior to obtaining the Earthstone
Stockholder Approval, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or enter into an Acquisition Agreement; provided,
however, that Earthstone shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make
any Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or
execute or enter into an Acquisition Agreement for a Superior Proposal (x)
until five (5) Business Days after Earthstone provides written notice to Bold
(an " _Earthstone Notice_ ") advising Bold that the Earthstone
Special Committee has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and identifying the person or
group making such Superior Proposal and, at the request of Bold, Earthstone
shall negotiate in good faith with Bold during such five (5) Business Day
period, with respect to any alternative transaction (including any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement) that would allow the Earthstone
Special Committee not to make such Adverse Recommendation Change consistent
with its fiduciary duties (it being understood that any change in the
financial or other material terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new
Earthstone Notice and a new five (5) Business Day period under this  _Section
6.3(d)_ ).

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act),
other than Bold and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions), outside of the ordinary course of business, of assets of
Earthstone and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) equal
to twenty percent (20%) or more of Earthstones consolidated assets or to
which twenty percent (20%) or more of Earthstones revenues on a consolidated
basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions) of beneficial
ownership (within the meaning of Section 13 under the Exchange Act) of twenty
percent (20%) or more of any class of equity securities of Earthstone, (C)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would

 



-27-  result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity
securities of Earthstone or (D) merger, consolidation, unit exchange, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving Earthstone which is structured to permit such
Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least twenty percent
(20%) of Earthstones consolidated assets or equity interests; in each case,
other than the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Alternative
Proposal, obtained after the date of this Agreement and not in breach of this
_Section 6.3_ , to acquire, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent
(50%) of the outstanding equity securities of Earthstone or assets of
Earthstone and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a third
party, which is on terms and conditions which the Earthstone Special Committee
determines in its good faith to be more favorable to the Earthstone
Stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated hereby, as they may be modified pursuant to
negotiations between the Parties in accordance with the provisions of _Section
6.3(d)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.3_ to the contrary, the
Earthstone Special Committee may, at any time prior to obtaining the
Earthstone Stockholder Approval, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to circumstances not involving an Alternative Proposal if an
Intervening Event occurs and the Earthstone Special Committee concludes
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisors, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that Earthstone
shall provide Bold with five (5) Business Days prior written notice advising
Bold it intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying, in
reasonable detail, the reasons therefor (including the material facts and
circumstances giving rise to the necessity for such Adverse Recommendation
Change), and during such five (5) Business Day period, Earthstone shall
consider in good faith any proposal by Bold to amend the terms and conditions
of this Agreement in a manner that would allow the Earthstone Special
Committee not to make such Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its
fiduciary duties.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Earthstone or the
Earthstone Special Committee from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying
with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or other applicable Law
with respect to an Alternative Proposal if the Earthstone Special Committee
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that any
Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with _Section
6.3(d)_ and _Section 6.3(f)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement
that describes Earthstones receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

Section 6.4 _Public Announcements; Confidentiality_.

(a) The initial press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by
Earthstone and Bold. Thereafter, Bold shall not issue any press releases or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the
express written consent of Earthstone (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and Earthstone shall not issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
consent of Bold (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law or by any applicable
listing agreement with the NYSE MKT as determined in the good faith judgment
of Earthstone (in which case Earthstone shall not issue or cause the
publication of such press release or other public announcement without
prior consultation with Bold); provided, however, that Earthstone shall not
be required by this _Section 6.4_ to consult with any other Party with respect
to a public announcement in connection with the receipt and existence of an
Alternative Proposal that the Earthstone Special Committee believes is bona
fide and matters related thereto or an Adverse Recommendation Change but
nothing in this proviso shall limit any obligation of Earthstone under
_Section 6.3(c)_ to advise and inform Bold;

 



-28-  provided, further, that each Party and their respective controlled
affiliates may make statements that are consistent with statements made in
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Earthstone or Bold in compliance with this _Section 6.4(a)_. 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section_ _ _ _6.4(a)_ to the contrary, the
Parties shall keep all information and data relating to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby strictly confidential except for
disclosures to Representatives of the Parties and any disclosures required to
perform this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
restrict disclosures that (i) are necessary for a Party to perform this
Agreement (including such disclosure to Governmental Bodies, rights of consent
or other rights that may be applicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as is reasonably necessary to provide notices, seek waivers,
amendments or termination of such rights, or seek such consents); (ii) are
required (upon advice of counsel) by applicable securities or other Laws
or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the
Parties or their respective Affiliates; or (iii) are otherwise subject to an
undertaking of confidentiality from each Person receiving such information in
form reasonably acceptable to the non-disclosing Parties.

Section 6.17 _Bold Employee Matters_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that all employees of Bold or any Bold Subsidiary
(these employees, the " _Bold Employees_ ") will remain employed by Bold
Operating, LLC for a transitional period of three (3) months following the
Closing Date (this period, the " _Transition Period_ "), it being understood
that no Party to this Agreement can prevent any Bold Employee from resigning
his or her employment with Bold Operating, LLC at any time. Within thirty (30)
days after the Closing Date, with respect to each Bold Employee, Earthstone
shall either (i) extend a written offer to continue the employment of such
Bold Employee on a permanent basis following the end of the Transition Period
(such offer, a " _Permanent Offer_ " and these employees, the " _Permanent
Offered Employees_ ") or (ii) provide written notice to such Bold Employee
that Earthstone will not continue their employment on a permanent basis and
that their employment will be terminated at the end of the Transition Period
(these employees, the " _Transitional Employees_ "). Each Permanent Offer
must provide the Bold Employee with a

 



-34-  period of fifteen (15) days after the date of the Permanent Offer in which
to elect, in writing, whether to accept or reject the Permanent Offer. The
Permanent Offered Employees who accept the Permanent Offer and continue
employment with Earthstone or its Subsidiaries (including Bold Operating, LLC)
following the Transition Period are referred to herein as the " _Hired
Employees_." The Permanent Offered Employees who reject a Qualifying
Permanent Offer are referred to herein as " _Rejecting Employees_ " and the
Permanent Offered Employees who reject a Permanent Offer that is not a
Qualifying Permanent Offer and resign their employment will be treated as
Transitional Employees for all purposes under this Agreement, including for
purposes of the right to receive severance payments under _Section 6.17(c)_
below. A " _Qualifying Permanent Offer_ " is an offer of continued employment
on the same terms and conditions and in a comparable position as applied to
such Bold Employee immediately prior to Closing and at the same location as
such Bold Employees current employment or a comparable location
(i.e., within twenty-five (25) miles of such Bold Employees current
employment), and that provides (I) a base salary or wage rate that is no less
favorable than the base salary or wage rate provided to such Bold Employee
immediately prior to Closing, (II) incentive compensation opportunities
(including equity compensation) that are substantially comparable to those
provided to other similarly situated employees of Earthstone and its
Subsidiaries and (III) retirement and group health and welfare benefits that
are substantially comparable to those provided to other similarly situated
employees of Earthstone and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) During the Transition Period, each Bold Employee shall be provided with
(i) employment by Bold Operating, LLC (A) on the same terms and conditions
and in a comparable position as applied to such Bold Employee immediately
prior to Closing and (B) at the same location as such Bold Employees current
employment or a comparable location (i.e., within twenty-five (25) miles of
such Bold Employees current employment), (ii) a base salary or wage rate that
is no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate provided to such Bold
Employees immediately prior to Closing and (iii) continuation of the Bold
compensation or other benefit plans and arrangements or, at Earthstones
election, other compensation or benefit plans and arrangements provided by
Earthstone that are substantially comparable individually or in the aggregate
to those provided to such Bold Employees immediately prior to Closing.

(c) With respect to (i) each Transitional Employee (including a Permanent
Offered Employee who becomes a Transitional Employee) who remains employed
with Earthstone or its Subsidiaries (including Bold Operating, LLC) through
the end of the Transition Period or (ii) each Bold Employee (including any
Transitional Employee) who is terminated without Cause prior to the end of the
Transition Period, Earthstone shall provide, through the remainder of the
Transition Period (in the case of a Bold Employee terminated pursuant to
clause (ii)) and for a period of four months following the end of the
Transition Period, severance payments representing (A) continuation of such
Bold Employees base salary or wages and (B) reimbursement for the full cost
of COBRA continuation coverage for participation in group health plans that
provide substantially comparable coverage as was provided to such Bold
Employee immediately prior to Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Cause_ " shall mean the Bold Employees (1) material and willful failure to
perform the material duties of the employees position that continues for
thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice describing such failure,
(2) commission of an act of fraud or dishonesty against or with respect to
Earthstone or any of its Subsidiaries that causes material harm to
Earthstones or any of its Subsidiaries reputation or business, (3)
conviction or plea of no contest to a felony or crime involving moral
turpitude, or (4) willful misconduct that is materially injurious to
Earthstone or any of its Subsidiaries. As a condition to receiving the
foregoing severance benefits, each Transitional Employee must sign and not
revoke a release of claims against Earthstone and Bold and their Affiliates in
a form reasonably acceptable to each of Earthstone and Bold.

 

(d) With respect to each Hired Employee and each Rejecting Employee who
remains an employee of Earthstone or its Subsidiaries (including Bold
Operating, LLC) through the end of the Transition Period, on or as soon as
practicable following such date, Earthstone shall pay such employee a lump-sum
cash retention bonus in an amount equal to one month of such employees base
salary or wages. In addition, each Hired Employee who remains an employee of
Earthstone or its Subsidiaries (including Bold Operating, LLC) for a period of
three months following the end of the Transition Period (the " _Post-
Transition Retention Period_ ") (or who is terminated without Cause during the
Post-Transition Retention Period and signs and does not revoke a release of
claims against Earthstone and Bold and their Affiliates in a form reasonably
acceptable to each of Earthstone and Bold) shall receive an additional lump-
sum cash retention bonus equal to three months of such employees base salary
or wages, payable as soon as practicable after the end of the Post-
Transition Retention Period, or such date of termination, if applicable.

 



-35- (e) From and after the Closing, if Earthstone elects to
provide compensation or benefit plans or arrangements to Bold Employees as
provided in Section 6.17(b), Earthstone shall give such Bold Employees
receiving such benefits, as well as each Hired Employee that no longer
receives benefits under 6.17(b), full credit for all purposes under any
employee benefit plans, arrangements, collective agreements and employment-
related entitlements (including under any applicable pension, 401(k), savings,
medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, long-service leave or other leave
entitlements, and severance or separation pay plans) that are or in the future
may be provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Earthstone or any
of its Affiliates in which such employees are eligible to participate
for such employees service with Bold or its Affiliates, and with any
predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized by Bold and its
Affiliates, except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication
of benefits for the same period of service. For the avoidance of doubt no
Bold Employee will be eligible to participate in an Earthstone 401(k) Plan
until he or she becomes a Hired Employee Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall Earthstone be required to provide credit for such service for
benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan. In addition,
to the extent the Bold Employee commences participation in any welfare benefit
plan sponsored by Earthstone or its Affiliates during the plan year in which
the Closing occurs, Earthstone shall (i) waive for each Bold Employee and his
or her dependents, any waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid
a waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-
work requirement and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or
full participation under such plan(s) to the extent such waiting period, pre-
existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other
restriction would not have been applicable to such employee under the terms
of the corresponding benefit plan of Bold or its Affiliate, and (ii) give full
credit to each Bold Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and
deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year as the
Closing, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single
continuous employer.

 

(f) This _Section 6.17_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section 6.17_ , express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 6.17_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify, or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination of, any Benefit Plan or any other program,
agreement or arrangement relating to compensation or employee benefits. The
Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this
_Section 6.17_ shall not create any right in any Bold Employee or any other
Person to any continued employment with Earthstone, Bold Operating, LLC or any
of their Affiliates or any compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever.

it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section 7.4(a)_ or _Section 7.4(b)_ and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Bold within thirty (30) days
following receipt of written notice from Earthstone of such breach or failure;

perform any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the representations or
warranties of Earthstone, EEH or Lynden set forth in this Agreement
shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would (if it occurred or
was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ , _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.2(c)_ and (B)
is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Earthstone, EEH or Lynden,
as applicable, within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice

this Agreement as provided in  _Section 9.1_ , written notice thereof shall

forthwith become null and void (other than the provisions in _Section 6.4_

remedies available at law or in equity.

brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be

any claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in

improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

 



-44- (c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 10.5 _Waivers_. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of
its obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by
the Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by
such Party and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other manner.
No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent to a
change in, other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirement that the Earthstone Stockholder
Approval include the vote of a Majority of the Disinterested in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby may not be
waived.

 

Section 10.6 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign all or any part of this
Agreement, nor shall any Party assign or delegate any of its rights or duties
hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other Parties, which
consent may be withheld for any reason, and any assignment or delegation made

shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including, for purposes
of certainty, the Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto), the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreement and the documents
to be executed hereunder and in connection herewith constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter
hereof.

 

Section 10.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only
by an agreement in writing executed by all Parties and expressly identified
as an amendment or modification.

Section 10.9 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement
shall entitle any Person other than a Party to any claim, cause of action,
remedy or right of any kind, except as provided in _Section 6.18_ and _Section
6.19_ (which will be to the benefit of the Persons referred to in such
Sections).

Section 10.10 _Construction_. The Parties acknowledge that (a) each Party
has had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the
negotiation of the details of the transaction contemplated hereby, (b) this
Agreement is the result of arms-length negotiations from equal
bargaining positions and (c) each Party and its counsel participated in the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement. Any rule of construction that a
contract be construed against the drafter shall not apply to the
interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

 



-45- Section 10.11 _Limitation on Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
CONTRARY, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DAMAGES INCURRED BY THIRD PARTIES FOR
WHICH INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF THE
PARTIES SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
PROVIDED IN THIS SENTENCE, EACH OF THE PARTIES, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF
THE MEMBERS OF BOLD, EEH AND THE EARTHSTONE SUBSIDIARIES, AS APPLICABLE,
HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS IN CONNECTION WITH
OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 10.12 _Conspicuous_. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT, TO THE
EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE PROVISIONS IN THIS
AGREEMENT IN BOLD-TYPE ALL CAPS FONT ARE "CONSPICUOUS" AND COMPLY WITH THE
EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW. 

Section 10.13 _Time of Essence_. This Agreement contains a number of dates
and times by which performance or the exercise of rights is due, and the
Parties intend that each and every such date and time be the firm and final
date and time, as agreed. For this reason, each Party hereby waives and
relinquishes any right it might otherwise have to challenge its failure to
meet any performance or rights election date applicable to it on the basis
that its late action constitutes substantial performance, to require the other
Parties to show prejudice, or on any equitable grounds. Without limiting the
foregoing, time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the date specified in
this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business
Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any
action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the date for
giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of such
period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be
the next day that is a Business Day.

Section 10.14 _Severability_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
term or provision of this Agreement in any situation or jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other terms or provisions hereof
or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction, and the remaining terms and
provisions shall remain in full force and effect unless doing so would result
in an interpretation of this Agreement that is manifestly unjust.

 

Section 10.15 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the subject matter of this Agreement, including the business,
assets and properties of Earthstone and Bold, and their Affiliates, is unique,
that the other Party(ies) would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached, and that remedies at law would not
be adequate to compensate such other Party(ies) not in default or in breach.
Accordingly, except with respect to a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article 9, each Party agrees that the other Party(ies)
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they
may be entitled, at law or in equity. The Parties waive any defense that a
remedy at Law is adequate and any requirement to post bond or provide similar
security in connection with actions instituted for injunctive relief or
specific performance of this Agreement.

Board of Directors. Initial class assignments shall be determined by the Board
of Directors. At each annual meeting of stockholders, successors to the
directors whose terms expired at that annual meeting shall be elected for a
three-year term except that, initially, the director elected to Class I will
be subject to election for a three-year term at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders in 2019; the director elected to Class II will be subject to
election for a three-year term at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2017;
and the director elected to Class III will be subject to election for a three-
year term at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2018. If the number
of directors changes, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the
classes such that the number of directors in each class shall remain as nearly
equal as possible, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors
shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director shall hold office
until the annual meeting for the year in which his term expires and until his
successor shall be elected and qualified, subject, however, to such directors
prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from
office.

In the event the holders of any class or series of preferred stock shall
be entitled, by a separate class vote, to elect directors as may be specified
pursuant to Article 4, then the provisions of such class or series of stock
with respect to their rights shall apply. The number of directors that may be
elected by the holders of any such class or series of preferred stock shall
be in addition to the number fixed pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this
Article 5.

 

5.2 _Quorum_. A quorum of the Board of Directors for the transaction of
business shall not consist of less than a majority of the total number of
directors, except as otherwise may be provided in this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or in the bylaws with respect to filling
vacancies.

 

5.3 _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Except as otherwise fixed
pursuant to the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred
stock to elect directors under specified circumstances, newly created
directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors and any
vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation,
disqualification, removal or other cause shall be filled solely by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, or
by a sole remaining director, even though less than a quorum of the Board
of Directors. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence
shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the new directorship
which was created or in which the vacancy occurred and until such directors
successor shall have been elected and qualified.

 



Exhibit A - 3 ARTICLE 6

 

BYLAWS

Except as otherwise provided in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation, in furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred
by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, repeal,
alter, amend and rescind any or all of the bylaws of the Company.

ARTICLE 7

 

LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS

 

7.1 _General_. To the fullest extent permitted by Section 102(b)(7) of the
DGCL, the personal liability of a director to the Company and its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director
of the Company is eliminated, provided that such provision shall not limit the
liability of a director (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty
to the Company or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good
faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,
(iii) under section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which
the director derived an improper personal benefit.

7.2 _Amendment_. No amendment, modification or repeal of this Article 7,
nor the adoption of any provision of the Companys Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article 7, shall adversely
affect any right or protection of a director that exists at the time of such
amendment, modification or repeal.

ARTICLE 8

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

8.1 _General_. The Company shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted
by and in the manner permissible under the DGCL, as amended from time to time
(but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than
said law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment), any
person made, or threatened to be made, a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether criminal, civil,
administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person (a)
is or was a director or officer of the Company or any predecessor of the
Company or (b) served any other corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise as a director, officer,
partner, trustee, employee or agent at the request of the Company or any
predecessor of the Company; provided, however, that except for a suit by a
person against the Company to recover indemnified amounts, the Company shall
indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.

 

8.2 _Nonexclusivity_. The right to indemnification in this Article 8 shall
not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute, provision of the Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
Disinterested Directors or otherwise. No repeal or modification of this
Article 8 shall in any way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any
present or former director or officer of the Company or any predecessor
thereof hereunder in respect of any occurrence or matter arising prior to any
such repeal or modification. " _Disinterested Director_ " means a director of
the Company who is not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which
indemnification is sought by the claimant and otherwise has no material
interest in the matter as determined by the Board.

8.3 _Insurance_. The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have
the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss
under the DGCL.

 



Exhibit A - 4 8.4 _Indemnification of Other Persons_. The Company may grant rights to
indemnification to any present or former employee or agent of the Company or
any predecessor of the Company to the fullest extent of the provisions of this
Article 8 with respect to the indemnification of directors and officers of the
Company. 

ARTICLE 9

Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the
laws of the State of Delaware, and all rights conferred herein are granted
subject to this reservation.

ARTICLE 10

 

STOCKHOLDERS

 

10.1 _Meetings_. Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without
the State of Delaware, as determined by the Board of Directors. Each meeting
of stockholders will be held on the date and at the time and place determined

the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock, special
meetings of the stockholders may be called by an officer of the Company only
upon the written request of a majority of the Board of Directors.

 

10.2 _Stockholder Action by Written Consent_. Any action required to be
taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, or any action which
may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent
in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders
of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and shall
be delivered to the Company by delivery to its registered office in the State
of Delaware, its principal executive offices, or an officer or agent of the
Company having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. 

ARTICLE 11

VOTING REQUIREMENT

Certificate of Incorporation or of the bylaws (and notwithstanding the fact

issued, and (ii) PubCo shall concurrently contribute to the Company the net
proceeds received by PubCo for such share of Class A Stock or other Equity
Security; _provided_ , however, that if PubCo issues any shares of Class A
Stock in order to purchase or fund the purchase from a Member of a number of
Units (and shares of Class B Stock) equal to the number of shares of Class A
Stock so issued, then the Company shall not issue any new Units in connection
therewith, PubCo shall not be required to transfer such net proceeds to the
Company, and such net proceeds shall instead be transferred to such Member
as consideration for such purchase. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 4.1(e)_ shall not apply to the issuance and distribution to holders
of shares of PubCo Common Stock of rights to purchase Equity Securities of
PubCo under a "poison pill" or similar shareholders rights plan (and upon any
redemption of Units for Class A Stock, such Class A Stock will be issued
together with a corresponding right under such plan), or to the issuance under
PubCos employee benefit plans of any warrants, options, other rights to
acquire Equity Securities of PubCo or rights or property that may be converted
into or settled in Equity Securities of PubCo, but shall in each of the
foregoing cases apply to the issuance of Equity Securities of PubCo in
connection with the exercise or settlement of such rights, warrants, options
or other rights or property. Except pursuant to _Section 4.7_ , (x) the
Company may not issue any additional Units to PubCo or any of
its Subsidiaries unless substantially simultaneously therewith PubCo or such
Subsidiary issues or sells an equal number of shares of PubCos Class A Stock
to another Person, and (y) the Company may not issue any other Equity
Securities of the Company to PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries unless
substantially simultaneously PubCo or such Subsidiary issues or sells, to
another Person, an equal number of shares of a new class or series of Equity
Securities of PubCo or such Subsidiary with substantially the same rights to
dividends and distributions (including distributions upon liquidation) and
other economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of the Company. If at
any time PubCo issues Debt Securities, PubCo shall transfer to the Company
(in a manner to be determined by the Manager Member in its reasonable
discretion) the proceeds received by PubCo in exchange for such Debt
Securities in a manner that directly or indirectly burdens the Company with
the repayment of the Debt Securities. 
---|---|--- 



     | f. |

PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the Company, may not redeem,
repurchase or otherwise acquire (i) any shares of Class A Stock (including
upon forfeiture of any unvested shares of Class A Stock) unless substantially
simultaneously the Company redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires from
PubCo or such Subsidiary an equal number of Units for the same price per
security or (ii) any other Equity Securities of PubCo unless substantially
simultaneously the Company redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires from
PubCo an equal number of Equity Securities of PubCo of a corresponding class
or series with substantially the same rights to dividends and distributions
(including distributions upon liquidation) and other economic rights as those
of such Equity Securities of PubCo for the same price per security. The
Company may not redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (A) except pursuant
to _Section 4.7_ , any Units from PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries unless
substantially simultaneously PubCo or such Subsidiary redeems, repurchases or
otherwise acquires an equal number of shares of Class A Stock for the same
price per security from holders thereof, or (B) any other Equity Securities of
the Company from PubCo or any of 

---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 12 such Subsidiary redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires for the same price
per security an equal number of Equity Securities of PubCo of a corresponding
class or series with substantially the same rights to dividends and
distributions (including distribution upon liquidation) and other economic
rights as those of such Equity Securities of PubCo. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent that any consideration payable by PubCo in
connection with the redemption or repurchase of any shares of Class A Stock or
other Equity Securities of PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries consists (in whole
or in part) of shares of Class A Stock or such other Equity Securities
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the cashless
exercise of an option or warrant), then the redemption or repurchase of the
corresponding Units or other Equity Securities of the Company shall be
effectuated in an equivalent manner. 
---|--- 



     | g. | The Company shall not in any manner effect any subdivision
(by any equity split, equity distribution, reclassification, recapitalization
or otherwise) or combination (by reverse equity split,
reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of the outstanding Units
unless accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination, as applicable,
of the outstanding PubCo Common Stock, with corresponding changes made with
respect to any other exchangeable or convertible securities. PubCo shall not
in any manner effect any subdivision (by any stock split, stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse
stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of the
outstanding PubCo Common Stock unless accompanied by an identical subdivision
or combination, as applicable, of the outstanding Units, with corresponding
changes made with respect to any other exchangeable or
convertible securities. 
---|---|--- 

Section 4.2 _Voting Rights_. No Member has any voting or consent
right except with respect to those matters expressly requiring the approval
of Members under this Agreement. Each Unit will entitle the holder thereof to
one vote on all matters to be voted on by the Members. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, the holders of Units having voting
rights will vote together as a single class on all matters to be approved by
the Members.

 

Section 4.3 _Capital Contributions; Unit Ownership_.

 



     | _a._  | _Capital Contributions_. Each Member named on _Exhibit
C_ shall be credited with the Class A Conversion Date Capital Account Balance
set forth on _Exhibit C_ in respect of its Interest specified thereon. Except
as otherwise set forth in _Section 4.1(e)_ , no Member shall be required to
make additional Capital Contributions. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. |

_Issuance of Additional Units or Interests_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, the Managing Member shall have the right to
authorize and cause the Company to issue on such terms (including price) as
may be determined by the Managing Member (i) subject to the limitations of
_Section 4.1_ , additional Units or other Equity Securities in the Company
(including creating preferred interests or other classes or series of
interests having such rights, preferences and privileges as determined by the
Managing Member, which rights, preferences and privileges may be senior
to the Units), and (ii) obligations, evidences of Indebtedness or other
securities or interests convertible or exchangeable for Units or other Equity
Securities in the Company; _provided_ that, at any time following the date
hereof, in each case the Company shall not issue Equity Securities in the
Company to any Person unless such Person shall have executed a counterpart to
this Agreement and all other documents, agreements or instruments deemed
necessary or desirable in the discretion of the Managing Member. Upon such
issuance and execution, such Person shall be admitted as a Member of the
Company. In that event, the Managing Member shall amend _Exhibits B_ and _C_
to reflect such additional issuances. Subject to  _Section 12.1_ , the
Managing Member is hereby authorized to amend this Agreement to set forth the
designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties of such additional Units
or other Equity Securities in the Company, or such other amendments that the
Managing Member determines to be otherwise necessary or appropriate in
connection with the creation, authorization or issuance of, any class or
series of Units or other Equity Securities in the Company pursuant to this
_Section 4.3(b)_ ; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Managing
Member shall have the right to amend this Agreement as set forth in this
sentence without the approval of any other Person (including any Member) and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (including 

---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 13 consummate any offering of shares of PubCo Common Stock or other Equity
Securities of PubCo provided that the designations, preferences, rights,
powers and duties of any such additional Units or other Equity Securities of
the Company as set forth in such amendment are substantially similar to those
applicable to such shares of PubCo Common Stock or other Equity Securities of
PubCo. 
---|--- 

Section 4.4 _Capital Accounts_. A Capital Account shall be maintained
for each Member in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and, to the extent consistent with such regulations,
the other provisions of this Agreement. The Capital Account balance of each of
the Members as of the date hereof is its respective Class A Conversion Date
Capital Account Balance set forth on _Exhibit C_. Thereafter, each Members
Capital Account shall be (a) increased by (i) allocations to such Member of
Profits pursuant to _Section 5.1_ and any other items of income or gain
allocated to such Member pursuant to _Section 5.2_ , (ii) the amount of
additional cash or the initial Gross Asset Value of any asset (net of any
Liabilities assumed by the Company and any Liabilities to which the asset is
subject) contributed to the Company by such Member, and (iii) any other
increases allowed or required by Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), and (b) decreased by (i) allocations to such Member of
Losses pursuant to _Section 5.1_ and any other items of deduction or loss
allocated to such Member pursuant to the provisions of _Section 5.2_ , (ii)
the amount of any cash or the Gross Asset Value of any asset (net of
any Liabilities assumed by the Company and any Liabilities to which the asset
is subject) distributed to such Member, and (iii) any other decreases allowed
or required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). In the event of
a Transfer of Units made in accordance with this Agreement, the Capital
Account of the Transferor that is attributable to the Transferred Units shall
carry over to the Transferee Member in accordance with the provisions of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _l_ ).

Section 4.5 _Reserved_.

 

Section 4.6 _Other Matters_.



     | a. | No Member shall demand or receive a return on or of its
Capital Contributions or resign from the Company without the consent of the
Managing Member. Under circumstances requiring a return of any Capital
Contributions, no Member has the right to receive property other than cash. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | No Member shall receive any interest, salary, compensation,
draw or reimbursement with respect to its Capital Contributions or its Capital
Account, or for services rendered or expenses incurred on behalf of the
Company or otherwise in its capacity as a Member, except as otherwise
provided in Section 7.9 or otherwise contemplated by this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | The Liability of each Member shall be limited as set forth in
the Act and other applicable Law and, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement or required by Law, no Member (or any of its Affiliates) shall
be personally liable, whether to the Company, to any of the other Members, to
the creditors of the Company, or to any other third party, for any debt or
Liability of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise,
solely by reason of being a Member of the Company. 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | Except as otherwise required by the Act, a Member shall not
be required to restore a deficit balance in its Capital Account, to lend any
funds to the Company or, except as otherwise set forth herein, to make
any additional contributions or payments to the Company. 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | The Company shall not be obligated to repay any Capital
Contributions of any Member. 
---|---|--- 

Section 4.7 _Redemption of Units_.



     | a. | (i) Each Redeeming Member shall be entitled to cause the
Company to redeem, at any time and from time to time, all or any portion of
such Members Units (together with the transfer and surrender of the same
number of shares of Class B Stock) for an equivalent number of shares of
Class A Stock (a "Redemption") or, at the Companys election made in
accordance with _Section 4.7(a)(iv)_ , cash equal to the Cash Election Amount
calculated with respect to such Redemption, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this _Section 4.7_. Upon the Redemption by a Member of
all of its Units, such Member shall, for the avoidance of doubt, cease to be a
Member of the Company. 
---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 14 (ii) Each Redeeming Member shall be permitted to effect a redemption of Units
pursuant to  _Section 4.7(a)(i)_ that involves less than 25% of its Units no
more frequently than on a quarterly basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a
Redeeming Member provides a Redemption Notice with respect to all of the Units
held by such Redeeming Member, such Redemption may occur at any time, subject
to this _Section 4.7_ ; _provided,_ further, that the Managing Member may, in
its sole discretion and at any time, permit any Member to effect a redemption
of a lesser number of Units.

(iii) In order to exercise the redemption right under _Section 4.7(a)(i)_ ,
the redeeming Member (the "Redeeming Member") shall provide written notice
(the "Redemption Notice") to the Company, with a copy to PubCo (the date of
delivery of such Redemption Notice, the "Redemption Notice Date"), stating
(i) the number of Units (together with the transfer and surrender of an equal
number of shares of Class B Stock) the Redeeming Member elects to have the
Company redeem, (ii) if the shares of Class A Stock to be received are to be
issued other than in the name of the Redeeming Member, the name(s) of the
Person(s) in whose name or on whose order the shares of Class A Stock are to
be issued, and (iii) if the Redeeming Member requires the Redemption to take
place on a specific date, such date, provided that, any such specified date
shall not be earlier than the date that would otherwise apply pursuant to
clause (i) of the definition of Redemption Date. If the Units to be redeemed
(or the shares of Class B Stock to be transferred and surrendered) by the
Redeeming Member are represented by a certificate or certificates, prior to
the Redemption Date, the Redeeming Member shall also present and surrender
such certificate or certificates representing such Units (or shares of Class
B Stock) during normal business hours at the principal executive offices of
the Company, or if any agent for the registration or transfer of Class A Stock
is then duly appointed and acting (the "Transfer Agent"), at the office of
the Transfer Agent. If required by the Managing Member, any certificate for
Units and any certificate for shares of Class B Stock (in each case, if
certificated) surrendered to the Company hereunder shall be accompanied by
instruments of transfer, in forms reasonably satisfactory to the Managing
Member and the Transfer Agent, duly executed by the Redeeming Member or the
Redeeming Members duly authorized representative.

 

(iv) Upon receipt of a Redemption Notice, the Company shall be entitled to
elect (a "Cash Election") to settle the Redemption by delivering to the
Redeeming Member, in lieu of the applicable number of shares of Class A Stock
that would be received in such Redemption, an amount of cash equal to the Cash
Election Amount for such Redemption. In order to make a Cash Election with
respect to a Redemption, the Company must provide written notice of such
election to the Redeeming Member (with a copy to PubCo) prior to 1:00 p.m.,
Houston time, on the second Business Day after the Redemption Notice Date. If
the Company fails to provide such written notice prior to such time, it shall
not be entitled to make a Cash Election with respect to such Redemption.

(v) For U.S. federal income (and applicable state and local) tax purposes,
each of the Redeeming Member, the Company and PubCo, as the case may be, agree
to treat each Redemption and, in the event a De Minimis Redemption Right is
exercised or PubCo exercises its Call Right, each transaction between the
Redeeming Member and PubCo, as a sale of the Redeeming Members Units
(together with the same number of shares of Class B Stock) to PubCo in
exchange for shares of Class A Stock or cash, as applicable. Accordingly, for
purposes of clarity, the parties agree that any Redemption shall be treated as
a transfer of an interest in a partnership by sale or exchange within the
meaning of Code Section 743(b), as applicable.

 



     | b. |

(i) The Redemption shall be completed on the Redemption Date; _provided_ that
the Company, PubCo and the Redeeming Member may change the number of Units
specified in the Redemption Notice to be redeemed and/or the Redemption Date
to another number and/or date by unanimous agreement signed in writing by each
of them; _provided_ further that a Redemption Notice may specify that the
Redemption is to be contingent (including as to timing) upon the consummation
of a purchase by another Person (whether in a tender or exchange offer, an
underwritten offering or otherwise) of the shares of Class A Stock for which
the Units are redeemable, or the closing of an announced merger, consolidation
or other transaction or event in which the shares of Class A Stock would be
exchanged or converted or become exchangeable for  

---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 15 provided that the foregoing shall not apply to any Redemption with respect to
which the Company has made a valid Cash Election. Provided the Company has
not made a valid Cash Election, the Redeeming Member may retract its
Redemption Notice by giving written notice (the "Retraction Notice") to the
Company (with a copy to PubCo) at any time prior to the Redemption Date. The
timely delivery of a Retraction Notice shall terminate all of the Redeeming
Members, the Companys and PubCos rights and obligations arising from the
retracted Redemption Notice. 
---|--- 
 

(ii) Unless the Redeeming Member has timely delivered a Retraction Notice as
provided in Section 4.7(b)(i) or PubCo has elected its Call Right pursuant to
Section 4.7(f), on the Redemption Date (to be effective immediately prior to
the close of business on the Redemption Date) (A) the Redeeming Member shall
transfer and surrender the Units to be redeemed (and a corresponding number
of shares of Class B Stock) to the Company, in each case free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, (B) PubCo shall contribute to the Company the
consideration the Redeeming Member is entitled to receive under Section
4.7(a)(i), (C) the Company shall (x) cancel the redeemed Units, (y) transfer
to the Redeeming Member the consideration the Redeeming Member is entitled to
receive under Section 4.7(a)(i), and (z) if the Units are certificated, issue
to the Redeeming Member a certificate for a number of Units equal to the
difference (if any) between the number of Units evidenced by the certificate
surrendered by the Redeeming Member pursuant to clause (ii)(A) of this Section
4.7(b) and the number of redeemed Units, (D) the Company shall issue to PubCo
a number of Units equal to the number of Units surrendered by the Redeeming
Member, and (E) PubCo shall cancel the surrendered shares of Class B Stock.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, in
the event that the Company makes a valid Cash Election, PubCo shall only be
obligated to contribute to the Company an amount in cash equal to the net
proceeds (after deduction of any underwriters discounts or commissions and
brokers fees or commissions) from the sale by PubCo of a number of shares of
Class A Stock equal to the number of Units and Class B Stock to be redeemed
with such cash; _provided_ that PubCos Capital Account shall be increased by
an amount equal to any such discounts, commissions and fees relating to such
sale of shares of Class A Stock in accordance with _Section 7.9_ ; _provided
further_ , that the contribution of such net proceeds shall in no event affect
the Redeeming Members right to receive the Cash Election Amount.



     | c. | If (i) there is any reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or other similar transaction pursuant to which the shares of
Class A Stock are converted or changed into another security, securities or
other property, or (ii) PubCo shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to
all holders of the shares of Class A Stock evidences of its indebtedness or
assets, including securities (including shares of Class A Stock and any
rights, options or warrants to all holders of the shares of Class A Stock to
subscribe for or to purchase or to otherwise acquire shares of Class A Stock,
or other securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for or
exercisable for shares of Class A Stock) but excluding any cash dividend or
distribution as well as any such distribution of indebtedness or assets
received by PubCo from the Company in respect of the Units, then upon any
subsequent Redemption, in addition to the shares of Class A Stock or the
Cash Election Amount, as applicable, each Member shall be entitled to receive
the amount of such security, securities or other property that such Member
would have received if such Redemption had occurred immediately prior to the
effective date of such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization,
other similar transaction, dividend, or other distribution, taking into
account any adjustment as a result of any subdivision (by any split,
distribution or dividend, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization
or otherwise) or combination (by reverse split, reclassification,
recapitalization or otherwise) of such security, securities or other property
that occurs after the effective time of such
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is any reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction in which the
shares of Class A Stock are converted or changed into another security,
securities or other property, or any dividend or distribution (other than an
excluded dividend or distribution, as described above), this _Section 4.7_
shall continue to be applicable, _mutatis mutandis_ , with respect to such
security or other property. This Agreement shall apply to the Units held by
the Members and their Permitted Transferees as of the date hereof, as well as
any Units hereafter acquired by a Member and his or her or its
Permitted Transferees. 
---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 16 purpose of issuance upon a Redemption, out of its authorized but unissued
shares of Class A Stock or other Equity Securities, such number of shares of
Class A Stock that shall be issuable upon the Redemption of all outstanding
Units (other than those Units held by PubCo or any Subsidiary of PubCo);
provided, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude PubCo
from satisfying its obligations with respect of a Redemption by delivery of
shares of Class A Stock or other Equity Securities that are held in the
treasury of PubCo. PubCo covenants that all shares of Class A Stock and other
Equity Securities that shall be issued upon a Redemption shall, upon issuance
thereof, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In addition, for so
long as the shares of Class A Stock or other Equity Securities are listed on a
National Securities Exchange, PubCo shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all shares of Class A Stock and such other Equity Securities
issued upon an Exchange to be listed on such National Securities Exchange at
the time of such issuance. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | e. | The issuance of shares of Class A Stock or other Equity
Securities upon an Exchange shall be made without charge to the Redeeming
Member for any stamp or other similar tax in respect of such issuance;
_provided_ , however, that if any such shares of Class A Stock or other
Equity Securities are to be issued in a name other than that of the Redeeming
Member, then the Person or Persons in whose name the shares are to be issued
shall pay to PubCo the amount of any tax that may be payable in respect of
any transfer involved in such issuance or shall establish to the satisfaction
of PubCo that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | f. | (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
4.7, but subject to Section 4.7(g), a Redeeming Member shall be deemed to have
offered to sell its Units as described in the Redemption Notice to PubCo,
and PubCo may, in its sole discretion, by means of delivery of Call Election
Notice in accordance with, and subject to the terms of, Section 4.7(f), elect
to purchase directly and acquire such Units (together with the transfer and
surrender of the same number of shares of Class B Stock) on the Redemption
Date by paying to the Redeeming Member (or, on the Redeeming Members written
order, its designee) that number of shares of Class A Stock the Redeeming
Member (or its designee) would otherwise receive pursuant to _Section
4.7(a)(i)_ or, at PubCos election, an amount of cash equal to the Cash
Election Amount of such shares of Class A Stock (the "Call Right"), whereupon
PubCo shall acquire the Units offered for Redemption by the Redeeming Member
(together with the transfer and surrender of the same number of shares of
Class B Stock) and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the
owner of such Units and shares of Class B Stock.  
---|---|--- 

(ii) PubCo may, at any time prior to the Redemption Date, in its sole
discretion deliver written notice (a "Call Election Notice") to the Company
and the Redeeming Member setting forth its election to exercise its Call
Right. A Call Election Notice may be revoked by PubCo at any time; provided
that any such revocation does not prejudice the ability of the parties to
consummate a Redemption on the Redemption Date. Except as otherwise provided
by Section 4.7(f), an exercise of the Call Right shall be consummated pursuant
to the same timeframe and in the same manner as the relevant Redemption would
have been consummated if PubCo had not delivered a Call Election Notice.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.7_ , but
subject to Section 4.7(f)(i), the Company may, at any time and from time to
time, in its sole discretion, deliver written notice to any De Minimis Member
setting forth the Companys election to exercise its right to redeem all, but
not less than all, of such De Minimis Members Units (together with the
transfer and surrender of the same number of shares of Class B Stock) (a "De
Minimis Redemption Right") as if the applicable De Minimis Member provided a
Redemption Notice hereunder. An exercise of a De Minimis Redemption Right
shall be consummated pursuant to the same timeframe and in the same manner as
a Redemption would have been consummated under _Section 4.7(f)(i)_  above.



     | g. |

In the event that a tender offer, share exchange offer, issuer bid, take-over
bid, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to shares of Class
A Stock (a "PubCo Offer") is proposed by PubCo or is proposed to PubCo or its
stockholders and approved by the board of directors of PubCo or is otherwise
effected or to be effected with the consent or approval of the board of
directors of PubCo, the Members (other than PubCo) shall be permitted to
participate in such PubCo Offer by delivery of a contingent Redemption Notice
in accordance with the second proviso of _Section 4.7(b)(i)_. In the case of
a PubCo Offer proposed by PubCo, PubCo will use its reasonable best efforts
expeditiously and in good faith to take all such actions and do all such
things as are necessary or desirable to enable and permit the Members to 

---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 17 economically equivalent basis as the holders of shares of Class A Stock
without discrimination; _provided_ that, without limiting the generality of
this sentence, PubCo will use its commercially reasonable efforts
expeditiously and in good faith to ensure that such Members may participate in
each such PubCo Offer without being required to redeem Units (or, if so
required, to ensure that any such Redemption shall be effective only upon,
and shall be conditional upon, the closing of such PubCo Offer). In no event
shall Members (other than PubCo) be entitled to receive in such PubCo Offer
aggregate consideration for each Unit that is greater than the consideration
payable in respect of each share of Class A Stock in connection with a PubCo
Offer. 
---|--- 



     | h. | No Redemption shall impair the right of the Redeeming Member
to receive any distributions payable on the Units so redeemed in respect of a
record date that occurs prior to the Redemption Date for such Redemption.
For the avoidance of doubt, no Redeeming Member, or a Person designated by an
Redeeming Member to receive shares of Class A Stock, shall be entitled to
receive, with respect to such record date, distributions or dividends both on
Units redeemed by such Redeeming Member and on shares of Class A Stock
received by such Redeeming Member, or other Person so designated, if
applicable, in such Redemption. 
---|---|--- 



     | i. | Any Units acquired by the Company under this Section 4.7 and
transferred by the Company to PubCo shall remain outstanding and shall not be
cancelled as a result of their acquisition by the Company. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, PubCo shall be automatically admitted
as a member of the Company with respect to any Units or other Equity
Securities in the Company it receives under this Agreement (including under
this _Section 4.7_ in connection with any Redemption).

ARTICLE V

 

ALLOCATIONS OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

 

Section 5.1 _Profits and Losses_. After giving effect to the allocations
under _Section 5.2_ and subject to _Section 5.5_ , Profits and Losses (and,
to the extent determined by the Managing Member to be necessary and
appropriate to achieve the resulting Capital Account balances described below,
any allocable items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit includable in
the computation of Profits and Losses) for each Fiscal Year or other taxable
period shall be allocated among the Members during such Fiscal Year or other
taxable period in a manner such that, after giving effect to the special
allocations set forth in _Sections 5.2_ and all distributions through the end
of such Fiscal Year or other taxable period, the Capital Account balance of
each Member, immediately after making such allocation, is, as nearly
as possible, equal to (a) the amount such Member would receive pursuant to
_Section 11.3(b)_ if all assets of the Company on hand at the end of such
Fiscal Year or other taxable period were sold for cash equal to their Gross
Asset Values, all liabilities of the Company were satisfied in cash in
accordance with their terms (limited with respect to each nonrecourse
liability to the Gross Asset Value of the assets securing such liability), and
all remaining or resulting cash was distributed, in accordance with _Section
11.3(b)_ , to the Members immediately after making such allocation, minus (b)
the sum of (i) such Members share of Company Minimum Gain and Member Minimum
Gain, computed immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of assets and (ii)
the amount, if any, any such Member is treated as obligated to contribute to
the Company computed immediately after the hypothetical sale of assets.

 

Section 5.2 _Special Allocations_.

 



     | a. | Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year or other taxable
period shall be specially allocated to the Members in the manner excess
nonrecourse liabilities of the Company are allocated pursuant to _Section
5.5(c)_. The amount of Nonrecourse Deductions for a Fiscal Year or other
taxable period shall equal the excess, if any, of the net increase, if any, in
the amount of Company Minimum Gain during that Fiscal Year or other taxable
period over the aggregate amount of any distributions during that Fiscal Year
or other taxable period of proceeds of a Nonrecourse Liability that are
allocable to an increase in Company Minimum Gain, determined in accordance
with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(d). 
---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 18 other taxable period shall be specially allocated to the Member who bears
economic risk of loss with respect to the Member Nonrecourse Debt to which
such Member Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Member bears the
economic risk of loss for such Member Nonrecourse Debt, the Member Nonrecourse
Deductions attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt shall be allocated
among the Members according to the ratio in which they bear the economic risk
of loss. This _Section 5.2(b)_ is intended to comply with the provisions of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during any Fiscal
Year or other taxable period (or if there was a net decrease in Company
Minimum Gain for a prior Fiscal Year or other taxable period and the Company
did not have sufficient amounts of income and gain during prior periods to
allocate among the Members under this _Section 5.2(c))_ , each Member shall be
specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such Fiscal Year or
other taxable period in an amount equal to such Members share of the net
decrease in Company Minimum Gain during such year (as determined pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(2)). This section is intended to
constitute a minimum gain chargeback under Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | d. | Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement except
_Section 5.2(c)_ , if there is a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain during
any Fiscal Year or other taxable period (or if there was a net decrease
in Member Minimum Gain for a prior Fiscal Year or other taxable period and
the Company did not have sufficient amounts of income and gain during prior
periods to allocate among the Members under this _Section 5.2(d)_ ), each
Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such
year in an amount equal to such Members share of the net decrease in Member
Minimum Gain (as determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(4)). This section is intended to constitute a partner nonrecourse
debt minimum gain chargeback under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4)
and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | e. | Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary except
_Section 5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_ , no Losses or other items of loss or
expense shall be allocated to any Member to the extent that such allocation
would cause such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or
increase any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) at the end of such
Fiscal Year. All Losses and other items of loss and expense in excess of
the limitation set forth in _this Section 5.2(e)_ shall be allocated to the
Members who do not have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit in proportion to
their relative positive Capital Accounts but only to the extent that such
Losses and other items of loss and expense do not cause any such Member to
have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit. 
---|---|--- 



     | f. | Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary except
_Section 5.2(c)_ and _Section 5.2(d)_ , in the event any Member unexpectedly
receives any adjustment, allocation or distribution described in paragraph
(4), (5) or (6) of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( _d_ ),
items of income and gain (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of
income, including gross income, and gain for the Fiscal Year or other taxable
period) shall be specially allocated to such Member in an amount and manner
sufficient to eliminate any Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of that Member as
quickly as possible; _provided_ that an allocation pursuant to this _Section
5.2(f)_ shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have
an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for
in this _Article V_ have been tentatively made as if this _Section 5.2(f)_
were not in this Agreement. This _Section 5.2(f)_ is intended to constitute a
qualified income offset under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)
_(d)_ and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | g. |

If any Member has a deficit balance in its Capital Account at the end of any
Fiscal Year or other taxable period that is in excess of the sum of (i) the
amount that such Member is obligated to restore and (ii) the amount that the
Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate
sentence of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and (i)(5), that
Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income, gain and
Simulated Gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible, provided
that an allocation pursuant to this _Section 5.2(f)_ shall be made only if and
to the extent that such Member 

---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 19 of such sum after all other allocations provided for in this _Article V_ have
been made as if _Section 5.2(f)_ and this  _Section 5.2(g)_ were not in this
Agreement. 
---|--- 



     | h. | To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any
Company asset pursuant to Code Sections 734(b) or 743(b) is required, pursuant
to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _m_ )(2)
or 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) _(m)_ (4), to be taken into account in determining
Capital Accounts as a result of a distribution to any Member in complete
liquidation of such Members Interest in the Company, the amount of such
adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if
the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment
decreases such basis) and such item of gain or loss shall be allocated to the
Members in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)
_(m)_ (2) if such section applies or to the Member to whom such distribution
was made if Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) _(m)_ (4) applies. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | i. | Simulated Depletion for each Depletable Property, and
Simulated Loss upon the Disposition of a Depletable Property, shall be
allocated among the Members in proportion to their shares of the Simulated
Basis in such property. 
---|---|--- 



     | j. | The allocations set forth in _Sections 5.2(a)_ through
_5.2(i)_ (the "Regulatory Allocations") are intended to comply with certain
requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Article V_ (other than the
Regulatory Allocations), the Regulatory Allocations (and anticipated future
Regulatory Allocations) shall be taken into account in allocating other items
of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Members so that, to the extent
possible, the net amount of such allocation of other items and the Regulatory
Allocations to each Member should be equal to the net amount that would have
been allocated to each such Member if the Regulatory Allocations had not
occurred. This _Section 5.2(j)_ is intended to minimize to the extent possible
and to the extent necessary any economic distortions which may result from
application of the Regulatory Allocations and shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent therewith. 
---|---|--- 

Section 5.3  _Allocations for Tax Purposes in General_.



     | a. | Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 5.3_ , each
item of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Company for U.S. federal
income tax purposes shall be allocated among the Members in the same manner as
such item is allocated under _Sections 5.1_ and _5.2_. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | In accordance with Code Section 704(c) and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (including the Treasury Regulations applying the
principles of Code Section 704(c) to changes in Gross Asset Values) _,_ items
of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any Company property
having a Gross Asset Value that differs from such propertys adjusted U.S.
federal income tax basis shall, solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
be allocated among the Members to account for any such difference using the
"traditional method with curative allocations," with the curative allocations
applied only to sale gain, under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(c), or
such other method or methods determined by the Managing Member to be
appropriate and in accordance with the applicable Treasury Regulations. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Any (i) recapture of depreciation or any other item of
deduction shall be allocated, in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections
1.1245-1(e) and 1.1254-5, to the Members who received the benefit of such
deductions (taking into account the effect of remedial allocations), and (ii)
recapture of grants credits shall be allocated to the Members in accordance
with applicable law. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | d. | Allocations pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ are solely for
purposes of federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect or in any way
be taken into account in computing any Members Capital Account or share of
Profits, Losses, other items or distributions pursuant to any provision of
this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | If, as a result of an exercise of a noncompensatory option to
acquire an interest in the Company, a Capital Account reallocation is required
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the Company
shall make corrective allocations pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(4)(x). 
---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 20 Section 5.4 _Income Tax Allocations with Respect to
Depletable Properties_.



     | a. | Cost and percentage depletion deductions with respect to any
Depletable Property shall be computed separately by the Members rather than
the Company. For purposes of such computations, the federal income tax basis
of each Depletable Property shall be allocated to each Member pro rata, in
accordance with the number of Units owned by such Member as of the time such
Depletable Property is acquired by the Company (and any additions to such
federal income tax basis resulting from expenditures required to be
capitalized in such basis shall be allocated among the Members in a manner
designed to cause the Members proportionate shares of such adjusted federal
income tax basis to be in accordance with their proportionate ownership of
Units as determined at the time of any such additions), and shall be
reallocated among the Members pro rata, in accordance with the number of Units
owned by such Member as determined immediately following the occurrence of an
event giving rise to an adjustment to the Gross Asset Values of the Companys
Depletable Properties pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of Gross Asset
Value. The Company shall inform each Member of such Members allocable share
of the federal income tax basis of each Depletable Property promptly
following the acquisition of such Depletable Property by the Company, any
adjustment resulting from expenditures required to be capitalized in such
basis, and any reallocation of such basis as provided in the previous
sentence. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | For purposes of the separate computation of gain or loss by
each Member on the taxable disposition of Depletable Property, the amount
realized from such disposition shall be allocated (i) first, to the Members in
an amount equal to the Simulated Basis in such Depletable Property in
proportion to their allocable shares thereof and (ii) second, any remaining
amount realized shall be allocated consistent with the allocation of Simulated
Gains. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | c. | The allocations described in this _Section 5.4_ are intended
to be applied in accordance with the Members "interests in partnership
capital" under Section 613A(c)(7)(D) of the Code; _provided_  that the
Members understand and agree that the Managing Member may authorize special
allocations of federal income tax basis, income, gain, deduction or loss, as
computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in order to eliminate
differences between Simulated Basis and adjusted federal income tax basis
with respect to Depletable Properties, in such manner as determined consistent
with the principles outlined in _Section 5.3(b)_. The provisions of this
_Section 5.4(c)_ and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to
allocations under Code Section 613A(c)(7)(D) are intended to comply with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(v) and shall be interpreted and
applied in a manner consistent with such Treasury Regulations. 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | Each Member, with the assistance of the Company, shall
separately keep records of its share of the adjusted tax basis in each
Depletable Property, adjust such share of the adjusted tax basis for any cost
or percentage depletion allowable with respect to such property and use such
adjusted tax basis in the computation of its cost depletion or in the
computation of its gain or loss on the disposition of such property by the
Company. Upon the reasonable request of the Company, each Member shall advise
the Company of its adjusted tax basis in each Depletable Property and any
depletion computed with respect thereto, both as computed in accordance with
the provisions of this subsection for purposes of allowing the Company to
make adjustments to the tax basis of its assets as a result of certain
transfers of interests in the Company or distributions by the Company. The
Company may rely on such information and, if it is not provided by the Member,
may make such reasonable assumptions as it shall determine with respect
thereto. 
---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 21 Section 5.5 _Other Allocation Rules_.

 



     | a. | The Members are aware of the income tax consequences of the
allocations made by this _Article V_ and the economic impact of the
allocations on the amounts receivable by them under this Agreement. The
Members hereby agree to be bound by the provisions of this _Article V_ in
reporting their share of Company income and loss for income tax purposes. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | The provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance
for each Member of a Capital Account as provided by _Section 4.4_ and the
allocations set forth in _Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4_ are intended to
comply with the Treasury Regulations and to reflect the intended economic
entitlement of the Members. If the Managing Member determines, in its sole
discretion, that the application of the provisions in _Sections 4.4, 5.1, 5.2,
5.3 or 5.4_ would result in non-compliance with the Treasury Regulations or
would be inconsistent with the intended economic entitlement of the Members,
the Managing Member is authorized to make any appropriate adjustments to such
provisions.  
---|---|--- 



     | c. | All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
allocable to an interest in the Company that may have been Transferred shall
be allocated between the Transferor and the Transferee based on the portion of
the Fiscal Year or other taxable period during which each was recognized as
the owner of such interest, without regard to the results of Company
operations during any particular portion of that year and without regard to
whether cash distributions were made to the Transferor or the Transferee
during that year; _provided,_ however, that this allocation must be made in
accordance with a method permissible under Code Section 706 and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | d. | The Members proportionate shares of the "excess nonrecourse
liabilities" of the Company, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.752-3(a)(3), shall be allocated to the Members in any
manner determined by the Managing Member and permissible under the Treasury
Regulations. 
---|---|--- 

ARTICLE VI

 

DISTRIBUTIONS

Section 6.1  _Distributions_.



     | a. | _Distributions_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law
and hereunder, and except as otherwise provided in Section 11.3, distributions
to Members may be declared by the Managing Member out of funds
legally available therefor in such amounts and on such terms (including the
payment dates of such distributions) as the Managing Member shall determine
using such record date as the Managing Member may designate; such distribution
shall be made to the Members as of the close of business on such record date
on a pro rata basis (except that, for the avoidance of doubt, repurchases or
redemptions made in accordance with _Section 4.1(f)_ or payments made in
accordance with _Section 7.4_ or Section 7.9 need not be on a pro rata
basis), in accordance with the number of Units owned by each Member as of the
close of business on such record date; provided, however, that the Managing
Member shall have the obligation to make distributions as set forth in
_Sections 6.2_ and 11.3(b)(ii); and _provided_ further that, notwithstanding
any other provision herein to the contrary, no distributions shall be made to
any Member to the extent such distribution would render the Company insolvent
or violate the Act. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, insolvency means
the inability of the Company to meet its payment obligations when due.
Promptly following the designation of a record date and the declaration of
a distribution pursuant to this _Section 6.1_, the Managing Member shall
give notice to each Member of the record date, the amount and the terms of the
distribution and the payment date thereof. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | _Successors_. For purposes of determining the amount of
distributions, each Member shall be treated as having made the Capital
Contributions and as having received the Distributions made to or received by
its predecessors in respect of any of such Members Units. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. |

_Distributions In-Kind_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
distributions may be made in cash or in kind, or partly in cash and partly in
kind, as determined by the Managing Member. To the extent that the Company
distributes property in-kind to the Members, the Company shall be treated as
making a  

---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 22 for purposes of _Section 6.1(a)_ and such property shall be treated as if it
were sold for an amount equal to its Fair Market Value. Any resulting deemed
gain or loss shall be allocated to the Members Capital Accounts in accordance
with _Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_. 
---|--- 
 

Section 6.2 _Tax-Related Distributions_. The Company shall make
distributions to all Members on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the
number of Units owned by each Member, at such times and in such amounts as the
Managing Member reasonably determines is necessary to enable PubCo to timely
satisfy all of the U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax liabilities
of PubCo, Lynden Energy Corp., a corporation existing under the laws of
British Columbia and a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo, and Lynden,
calculated in the aggregate.

 

Section 6.3 _Distribution Upon Resignation_. No resigning Member shall be
entitled to receive any distribution or the value of such Members Interest
in the Company as a result of resignation from the Company prior to the
dissolution and winding up of the Company, except as specifically provided in
this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE VII

Managing Member (in their capacity as such) shall not participate in the
control, management, direction or operation of the activities or affairs of
the Company and shall have no power to act for or bind the Company. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | In connection with the performance of its duties as the
Managing Member of the Company, the Managing Member acknowledges that it will
owe to the Company and the Members the same fiduciary duties as it would owe
to a Delaware corporation and its stockholders if it were a member of the
board of directors of such a corporation and the Members were stockholders of
such corporation. The Members acknowledge that the Managing Member will take
action through its board of directors, and that the members of the Managing
Members board of directors will owe comparable fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Managing Member. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 7.2 _Officers_.



     | a. | The Managing Member may appoint, employ or otherwise contract
with any Person for the transaction of the business of the Company or the

the Company as the Managing Member may from time to time deem appropriate. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | The initial president and chief executive officer of the
Company (the "President and Chief Executive Officer") will be Frank A.

executive officer of a corporation organized under the DGCL, subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and will have such other powers and duties as may
be prescribed by the 

---|---|--- 
 



Exhibit B - 23 Executive Officer will have the power to execute bonds, mortgages and other
contracts requiring a seal, under the seal of the Company, except where
required or permitted by Law to be otherwise signed and executed, and except
where the signing and execution thereof will be expressly delegated by the
Managing Member to some other Officer or agent of the Company. 
---|--- 
 



     | d. | Except as set forth herein, the Managing Member may appoint
Officers at any time, and the Officers may include one or more vice
presidents, a secretary, one or more assistant secretaries, a chief financial
officer, a general counsel, a treasurer, one or more assistant treasurers, a
chief operating officer, an executive chairman, and any other officers that
the Managing Member deems appropriate. Except as set forth herein, the
Officers will serve at the pleasure of the Managing Member, subject to all
rights, if any, of such Officer under any contract of employment. Any
individual may hold any number of offices, and an Officer may, but need not,
be a Member of the Company. The Officers will exercise such powers and
perform such duties as specified in this Agreement or as determined from time
to time by the Managing Member. 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | Subject to this Agreement and to the rights, if any, of an
Officer under a contract of employment, any Officer may be removed, either
with or without cause, by the Managing Member. Any Officer may resign at any
time by giving written notice to the Managing Member. Any resignation will
take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later time
specified in that notice; and, unless otherwise specified in that notice, the
acceptance of the resignation will not be necessary to make it effective. Any
resignation is without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the Company under
any contract to which the Officer is a party. A vacancy in any office because
of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or any other cause will be
filled in the manner prescribed in this Agreement for regular appointments to
that office. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 7.3 _Warranted Reliance by Officers on Others_. In exercising
their authority and performing their duties under this Agreement, the
Officers shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or
statements of the following persons or groups unless they have actual
knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such reliance to
be unwarranted:



     | a. | one or more employees or other agents of the Company or in
subordinates whom the Officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent
in the matters presented; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | any attorney, public accountant, or other person as to
matters which the Officer reasonably believes to be within such persons
professional or expert competence. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 7.4 _Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations and conditions
provided in this _Section 7.4_ , each Person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or arbitrative (each, a "Proceeding"), or any appeal in such a Proceeding or
any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, by reason
of the fact he, she or it, or a Person of which he, she or it is the legal
representative, is or was a Member, an Officer, or acting as the Tax Matters
Member or Company Representative of the Company, in each case, shall be
indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to
provide broader indemnification rights than such Law permitted the Company to
provide prior to such amendment) against all judgment, penalties (including
excise and similar taxes and punitive damages), fines, settlement and
reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
actually incurred by such Person in connection with such Proceeding, appeal,
inquiry or investigation, if such Person acted in Good Faith. Reasonable
expenses incurred by a Person of the type entitled to be indemnified under
this _Section 7.4_ who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant
or respondent in a Proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the
final disposition of the Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that he, she or it is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Company. Indemnification under this _Section 7.4_ shall continue as to a
Person who has ceased to serve in the capacity which initially entitled such
Person to indemnity hereunder. The rights granted pursuant to this  _Section
7.4_ shall be deemed contract rights, and no amendment, modification or repeal
of this _Section 7.4_ shall have the effect of limiting or denying any such
rights

 



Exhibit B - 24  with respect to actions taken or Proceedings, appeals, inquiries or
investigations arising prior to any amendment, modification or repeal. It is
expressly acknowledged that the indemnification provided in this _Section
7.4_ could involve indemnification for negligence or under theories of strict
liability.

Section 7.5  _Maintenance of Insurance or Other Financial Arrangements_.
In compliance with applicable Law, the Company (with the approval of the
Managing Member) may purchase and maintain insurance or make other
financial arrangements on behalf of any Person who is or was a Member,
employee or agent of the Company, or at the request of the Company is or was
serving as a manager, director, officer, employee or agent of another limited
liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, for any Liability asserted against such Person and Liability and
expenses incurred by such Person in such Persons capacity as such, or arising
out of such Persons status as such, whether or not the Company has the
authority to indemnify such Person against such Liability and expenses.

Section 7.6  _Resignation or Termination of Managing Member_. PubCo shall
not, by any means, resign as, cease to be or be replaced as Managing Member
except in compliance with this _Section 7.6_. No termination or replacement
of PubCo as Managing Member shall be effective unless proper provision is
made, in compliance with this Agreement, so that the obligations of PubCo, its
successor (if applicable) and any new Managing Member and the rights of all
Members under this Agreement and applicable Law remain in full force and
effect. No appointment of a Person other than PubCo (or its successor, as
applicable) as Managing Member shall be effective unless PubCo (or its
successor, as applicable) and the new Managing Member (as applicable) provide
all other Members with contractual rights, directly enforceable by such other
Members against PubCo (or its successor, as applicable) and the new Managing
Member (as applicable), to cause (a) PubCo to comply with all PubCos
obligations under this Agreement (including its obligations under _Section
4.7_ ) other than those that must necessarily be taken in its capacity as
Managing Member and (b) the new Managing Member to comply with all
the Managing Members obligations under this Agreement.

Section 7.7 _No Inconsistent Obligations_. The Managing Member
represents that it does not have any contracts, other agreements, duties or
obligations that are inconsistent with its duties and obligations (whether or
not in its capacity as Managing Member) under this Agreement and
covenants that, except as permitted by _Section 7.1_ , it will not enter into
any contracts or other agreements or undertake or acquire any other duties or
obligations that are inconsistent with such duties and obligations.

 

Section 7.8 _Reclassification Events of PubCo_. If a Reclassification
Event occurs, the Managing Member or its successor, as the case may be,
shall, as and to the extent necessary, amend this Agreement in compliance with
_Section 12.1_ , and enter into any necessary supplementary or additional
agreements, to ensure that, following the effective date of the
Reclassification Event: (i) the redemption rights of holders of Units set
forth in _Section 4.7_ provide that each Unit (together with the transfer and
surrender of one share of Class B Stock) is redeemable for the same amount and
same type of property, securities or cash (or combination thereof) that one
share of Class A Stock becomes exchangeable for or converted into as a result
of the Reclassification Event and (ii) PubCo or the successor to PubCo, as
applicable, is obligated to deliver such property, securities or cash upon
such redemption. PubCo shall not consummate or agree to consummate any
Reclassification Event unless the successor Person, if any, becomes obligated
to comply with the obligations of PubCo (in whatever capacity) under this
Agreement.

Section 7.9 _Certain Costs and Expenses_. The Company shall (i) pay, or
cause to be paid, all costs, fees, operating expenses and other expenses of
the Company (including the costs, fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants
or other professionals and the compensation of all personnel providing
services to the Company) incurred in pursuing and conducting, or otherwise
related to, the activities or capitalization of the Company, and (ii) in the
sole discretion of the Managing Member, bear and/or reimburse the Managing
Member for any costs, fees or expenses incurred by it in connection with
serving as the Managing Member. To the extent that the Managing Member
determines in its sole discretion that such expenses are related to the
business and affairs of the Managing Member that are conducted through the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries (including expenses that relate to the
business and affairs of the Company and/or its

 



Exhibit B - 25  Subsidiaries and that also relate to other activities of the Managing
Member), the Managing Member may cause the Company to pay or bear all expenses
of the Managing Member, including, without limitation, costs of securities
offerings not borne directly by members, board of directors compensation and
meeting costs, cost of periodic reports to its stockholders, litigation costs
and damages arising from litigation, accounting and legal costs and franchise
taxes, _provided_ that the Company shall not pay or bear any income tax
obligations of PubCo. In the event that (i) shares of Class A Stock were sold
to underwriters in any public offering after the Effective Time, in
each case, at a price per share that is lower than the price per share for
which such shares of Class A Stock are sold to the public in such public
offering after taking into account underwriters discounts or commissions and
brokers fees or commissions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
deferred discounts or commissions and brokers fees or commissions payable in
connection with or as a result of such public offering) (such difference, the
"Discount") and (ii) the proceeds from such public offering are used to fund
the Cash Election Amount for any redeemed Units or otherwise contributed to
the Company, the Company shall reimburse the Managing Member for such Discount
by treating such Discount as an additional Capital Contribution made by the
Managing Member to the Company, issuing Units in respect of such deemed
Capital Contribution in accordance with _Section 4.7(b)(ii)_ , and increasing
the Managing Members Capital Account by the amount of such Discount. For the
avoidance of doubt, any payments made to or on behalf of the Managing Member
pursuant to this Section 7.9 shall not be treated as a distribution pursuant

Members, acting in their capacity as Members, shall not have any right or
power to take part in the management or control of the Company or its
business and affairs or to act for or bind the Company in any way.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Members have all the rights and powers
specifically set forth in this Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent
with this Agreement, in the Act. The existence of these relationships and
acting in such capacities will not result in the Member (other than the
Managing Member) being deemed to be participating in the control of the
business of the Company or otherwise affect the limited liability of the
Member. A Member, any Affiliate thereof or an employee, stockholder, agent,
director or officer of a Member or any Affiliate thereof, may also be an
employee or be retained as an agent of the Company. Except as specifically
provided herein, a Member (other than the Managing Member) shall not, in its
capacity as a Member, take part in the operation, management or control of the
Companys business, transact any business in the Companys name or have the
power to sign documents for or otherwise bind the Company.

Section 8.2 _Voting_.

 



     | a. | Meetings of the Members may be called by the Managing Member
or upon the written request of Members holding at least 50% of the outstanding
Units. Such request shall state the location of the meeting and the nature
of the business to be transacted at the meeting. Written notice of any such
meeting shall be given to all Members not less than two Business Days nor more
than 30 days prior to the date of such meeting. Members may vote in person, by
proxy or by telephone at any meeting of the Members and may waive advance
notice of such meeting. Whenever the vote or consent of Members is permitted
or required under this Agreement, such vote or consent may be given at a
meeting of the Members or may be given in accordance with the procedure
prescribed in this _Section 8.2_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, the affirmative vote of the Members holding a majority of the
outstanding Units shall constitute the act of the Members. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | Each Member may authorize any Person or Persons to act for it
by proxy on all matters in which such Member is entitled to participate,
including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or participating at a
meeting. Every proxy must be signed by such Member or its attorney-in-fact.
No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date
thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable
at the pleasure of the Member executing it. 
---|---|---

is necessary consent thereto in writing.

ARTICLE IX

TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS

Section 9.1 _Restrictions on Transfer_.

 



     | a. | Except as provided in _Section 4.7_ and except for the
Transfers by a Member to Permitted Transferee, no Member shall Transfer all or
any portion of its Interest without the prior written consent of the
Managing Member, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If,
notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 9.1(a)_ , all or any portion
of a Members Interests are Transferred in violation of this _Section 9.1(a)_
, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, then without limiting any
other rights and remedies available to the other parties under this Agreement
or otherwise, the Transferee of such Interest (or portion thereof) shall not
be admitted to the Company as a Member or be entitled to any rights as a
Member hereunder, and the Transferor will continue to be bound by all
obligations hereunder, unless and until the Managing Member consents in
writing to such admission, which consent shall be granted or withheld in the
Managing Members sole discretion. Any attempted or purported Transfer of all
or a portion of a Members Interests in violation of this _Section 9.1(a)_
shall be null and void and of no force or effect whatsoever. For the
avoidance of doubt, the restrictions on Transfer contained in this _Article
IX_ shall not apply to the Transfer of any capital stock of the Managing
Member; _provided_ that no shares of Class B Stock may be Transferred unless
a corresponding number of Units are Transferred therewith in accordance with
this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | In addition to any other restrictions on Transfer herein
contained, including the provisions of this _Article IX_ , in no event may any
Transfer or assignment of Interests by any Member be made (i) to any Person
who lacks the legal right, power or capacity to own Interests; (ii) if in the
opinion of legal counsel or a qualified tax advisor to the Company such
Transfer presents a material risk that such Transfer would cause the Company
to cease to be classified as a partnership or to be classified as a "publicly
traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code; (iii)
if such Transfer would cause the Company to become, with respect to any
employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA, a "party-in-interest" (as
defined in Section 3 (14) of ERISA) or a "disqualified person" (as defined in
Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code); (iv) if such Transfer would, in the opinion
of counsel to the Company, cause any portion of the assets of the Company to
constitute assets of any employee benefit plan pursuant to the Plan Asset
Regulation or otherwise cause the Company to be subject to regulation under
ERISA; (v) if such Transfer requires the registration of such Interests or
any Equity Securities issued upon any exchange of such Interests, pursuant to
any applicable federal or state securities Laws; or (vi) if such Transfer
subjects the Company to regulation under the Investment Company Act or
the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, each as amended (or any succeeding law).
Any Transfer purported to be made in violation of this _Section 9.1(b)_ shall
be void ab initio. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 9.2 _Notice of Transfer_. Other than in connection with Transfers
made pursuant to _Section 4.7_ , each Member shall, after complying with the
provisions of this Agreement, but in any event no later than three Business
Days following any Transfer of Interests, give written notice to the Company
of such Transfer. Each such notice shall describe the manner and
circumstances of the Transfer.

Section 9.3 _Transferee Members_. A Transferee of Interests pursuant to
this _Article IX_ shall have the right to become a Member only if (i) the
requirements of this _Article IX_ are met, (ii) such Transferee executes an
instrument reasonably satisfactory to the 

 



Exhibit B - 27  Managing Member agreeing to be bound by the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and assuming all of the Transferors then existing and future
Liabilities arising under or relating to this Agreement, (iii) such
Transferee represents that the Transfer was made in accordance with all
applicable securities Laws, (iv) the Transferor or Transferee shall have
reimbursed the Company for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys
fees and expenses) of any Transfer or proposed Transfer of a Members
Interest, whether or not consummated and (v) if such Transferee or his or her
spouse is a resident of a community property jurisdiction, then such
Transferees spouse shall also execute an instrument reasonably satisfactory
to the Managing Member agreeing to be bound by the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to the extent of his or her community property or quasi-
community property interest, if any, in such Members Interest. Unless agreed
to in writing by the Managing Member, the admission of a Member shall not
result in the release of the Transferor from any Liability that the Transferor
may have to each remaining Member or to the Company under this Agreement or
any other Contract between the Managing Member, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Transferor or any of its Affiliates,
on the other hand. Written notice of the admission of a Member shall be
sent promptly by the Company to each remaining Member. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 9.3_ , and except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, following a Transfer by one or more Members (or a
transferee of the type described in this sentence) to a Permitted Transferee
of all or substantially all of their Interests, such transferee shall succeed
to all of the rights of such Member(s) under this Agreement.

 

Section 9.4 _Legend_. Each certificate representing a Unit, if any, will
be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the
following form:

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR

or paid with respect to a Member pursuant to this _Section 10.5_ shall be

payment is made. Further, to the extent that the cumulative amount of such
withholding or payment for any period exceeds the distributions to which such
Member is entitled for such period, the amount of such excess shall be
considered a loan from the Company to such Member, with interest accruing at
the Prime Rate in effect from time to time, compounded annually. The Managing
Member may, in its discretion, either demand payment of the principal and
accrued interest on such demand loan at any time (which payment shall not be
deemed a Capital Contribution for purposes of this Agreement), and enforce
payment thereof by legal process, or may withhold from one or more

obligations under any such demand loan.

any Person who ceases to be a Member shall be treated as a Member for purposes
of this _Section 10.5_ and (ii) the obligations of a Member pursuant to this 
_Section 10.5_ shall survive indefinitely with respect to any taxes withheld
or paid by the Company that relate to the period during which such Person was
actually a Member, regardless of whether such taxes are assessed, withheld or
otherwise paid during such period.

 _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_

(a) _Shelf Registration_. Parent shall (i) prepare and file by 10 Business
Days after the Closing Date a registration statement under the Securities Act
to permit the public resale of the Registrable Securities from time to time,
including as permitted by Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any similar
provision then in force) with respect to all of the Registrable Securities
(the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ") and (ii) cause the Shelf Registration
Statement to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter but
in no event later than 90 days after the Closing Date (the " _Effectiveness
Deadline_ ").

(b) The Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to this  _Section
2.01(a)_ shall be on Form S-3 of the SEC if Parent is eligible to use Form S-3
or Form S-1 of the SEC if Parent is not eligible to use Form S-3; _provided_ ,
_however,_ that if a prospectus supplement will be used in connection with
the marketing of an Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering
from the Shelf Registration Statement and the Managing Underwriter at any time
shall notify the Holders in writing that, in the reasonable judgment of
such Managing Underwriter, inclusion of detailed information to be used in
such prospectus supplement is of material importance to the success of the
Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering of such Registrable
Securities, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to include such
information in such a prospectus supplement. Subject to _Section 2.01(b)_ ,
Parent will cause the Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
_Section 2.01(a)_ to be continuously effective under the Securities Act from
and after the date it is first declared or becomes effective until all
Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been
distributed in the manner set forth and as contemplated in the Shelf
Registration Statement or there are no longer any Registrable Securities
outstanding (the " _Effectiveness Period_ "). The Shelf Registration Statement
when declared effective (including the documents incorporated therein
by reference) shall comply as to form with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and shall not contain an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. As soon
as practicable following the date of effectiveness of such Shelf Registration
Statement, but in any event within three (3) Business Days of such date,
Parent will notify the Selling Holders of the effectiveness of such Shelf
Registration Statement.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Parent hereby
agrees that (i) the Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
_Section 2.01(a)_ shall contain all language (including on the prospectus
cover sheet, the principal stockholders table and the plan of distribution)
as may be reasonably requested by Bold to allow for a distribution to, and
resale by, the direct and indirect members, stockholders or partners of Bold
(a " _Member Distribution_ ") and (ii) Parent shall, at the reasonable request
of Bold if seeking to effect a Member Distribution, file any prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendments and otherwise take any action
reasonably necessary to include such language, if such language was not
included in the initial Registration Statement, or revise such language if
deemed reasonably necessary by Bold to effect such Member Distribution.

(c) _Delay Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Parent may, upon written notice to (x) all Holders, delay the filing
of the Shelf Registration Statement or (y) any Selling Holder whose 

 



C - 4  Registrable Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement,
suspend such Selling Holders use of any prospectus which is a part of the
Shelf Registration Statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall
discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement but such Selling Holder may settle any contracted sales
of Registrable Securities) if Parent (i) is pursuing an acquisition, merger,
reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction and the Board of
Directors of Parent determines in good faith that its ability to pursue or
consummate such a transaction would be materially adversely affected by any
required disclosure of such transaction in the Shelf Registration Statement
or (ii) has experienced some other material non-public event the disclosure of
which at such time, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of
Parent would materially adversely affect Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , in
no event shall (A) such filing of the Shelf Registration Statement be delayed
under clauses (i) or (ii) of this _Section 2.01(b)_ for a period that exceeds
90 days or (B) such Selling Holders be suspended under clauses (i) or (ii) of
this _Section 2.01(b)_ from selling Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Shelf Registration Statement for a period that exceeds an aggregate of 30 days
in any 90-day period or 90 days in any 365-day period. Upon disclosure of
such information or the termination of the condition described above, Parent
shall provide prompt notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable
Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement, and shall
promptly terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall
take such other actions to permit registered sales of Registrable Securities
as contemplated in this Agreement. Parent will only exercise its suspension
rights under this _Section 2.01(b)_ if it exercises similar suspension rights
with respect to any Parity Holders. If Parent exercises its suspension rights
under this _Section 2.01(b)_ , then during such suspension period Parent shall
not engage in any transaction involving the offer, issuance, sale or purchase
of Equity Securities (whether for the benefit of Parent or a third Person),
except transactions involving the issuance or purchase of Equity Securities as
contemplated by Parent employee benefit plans or employee or director
arrangements.

Section 2.02 _Piggyback Rights_.

 

(a) _ _Participation__. Except as provided in _Section 2.02(b)_ , if at
any time during the Effectiveness Period, Parent proposes to file (i) a shelf
registration statement other than the Shelf Registration Statement (in which
event Parent covenants and agrees to include thereon a description of the
transaction under which the Holders acquired the Registrable Securities),
(ii) a prospectus supplement to an effective shelf registration statement,
other than the Shelf Registration Statement contemplated by _Section 2.01(a)_
of this Agreement, and Holders could be included without the filing of a
post-effective amendment thereto (other than a post-effective amendment that
is immediately effective), or (iii) a registration statement, other than a
shelf registration statement, in the case of each of clause (i), (ii)
or (iii), for the sale of Class A Common Stock in an Underwritten Offering or
Overnight Underwritten Offering for its own account and/or another Person,
then as soon as practicable but not less than ten Business Days (or one
Business Day in the case of an Overnight Underwritten Offering) prior to the
filing of (A) any preliminary prospectus supplement relating to such
Underwritten Offering pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, (B)
the prospectus supplement relating to such Underwritten Offering pursuant to
Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (if no preliminary prospectus supplement
is used) or (C) such registration statement (other than a Shelf Registration
Statement), as the case may be (an " _Underwritten Offering Filing_ "), then
Parent shall give notice (including, but not limited to, notification by
electronic mail) of such proposed Underwritten Offering (a " _Piggyback
Offering_ ") to the Holders and such notice shall offer the Holders the
opportunity to include in such Underwritten Offering such number of shares of
Class A Common Stock (the " _Included Registrable Securities_ ") as each such
Holder may request in writing; _provided_ , _however,_ that if Parent has
been advised by the Managing Underwriter that the inclusion of Registrable
Securities for sale for the benefit of the Selling Holders will have a
material adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Class A
Common Stock in the Underwritten Offering, then the amount of Registrable
Securities to be offered for the accounts of Selling Holders shall be
determined based on the provisions of _Section 2.02(c)_ of this Agreement. The
notice required to be provided in this _Section 2.02(a)_ to each Holder (the
" _Piggyback Notice_ ") shall be provided on a Business Day pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _3.01_ hereof. Each Holder shall then have five Business Days
(or one Business Day in the case of an Overnight Underwritten Offering) after
the date on which the Holders received the Piggyback Notice to request
inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Offering. If no
request for inclusion from a Holder is received within such period, such
Holder shall have no further right to participate in such Underwritten
Offering. If, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to
undertake an Underwritten Offering and prior to the closing of
such Underwritten Offering, the Board of Directors of Parent shall determine
for any reason not to undertake or to delay such Underwritten Offering, Parent
may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to the Selling
Holders and, (x) in the case of a determination not to undertake such
Underwritten Offering, shall be relieved of its obligation to sell any
Included Registrable Securities in connection with such terminated
Underwritten Offering, and (y) in the case of a 

 



C - 5  determination to delay such Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to
delay offering any Included Registrable Securities for the same period as the
delay in the Underwritten Offering. Any Selling Holder shall have the right
to withdraw such Selling Holders request for inclusion of such Selling
Holders Registrable Securities in such offering by giving written notice to
Parent of such withdrawal up to and including the time of pricing of such
offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Holder may deliver written notice
(an " _Opt-Out Notice_ ") to Parent requesting that such Holder not receive
notice from Parent of any proposed Underwritten Offering.

 

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Parent hereby
agrees that (i) any shelf registration statement which includes Registrable
Securities pursuant to this _Section 2.02(a)_ shall contain all language
(including on the prospectus cover sheet, the principal stockholders table
and the plan of distribution) as may be reasonably requested by such Holder
to allow for a Member Distribution and (ii) Parent shall, at the reasonable
request of the Holder seeking to effect a Member Distribution, file any
Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendments and otherwise take any
action reasonably necessary to include such language, if such language was
not included in the initial registration statement, or revise such language if
deemed reasonably necessary by such Holder to effect such Member Distribution.

 

(b) _ _Overnight Underwritten Offering Piggyback Rights__. If, at any time
during any Effectiveness Period, Parent proposes to file an Underwritten
Offering Filing and such Underwritten Offering is expected to be launched (the
" _Launch Date_ ") after the close of trading on one trading day and priced
before the open of trading on the next succeeding trading day (such execution
format, an " _Overnight Underwritten Offering_ "), then no later than one
Business Day after Parent engages a Managing Underwriter for the proposed
Overnight Underwritten Offering, Parent shall notify (including, but not
limited to, notice by electronic mail) the Holders of the pendency of the
Overnight Underwritten Offering and such notice shall offer the Holders the
opportunity to include in such Overnight Underwritten Offering such number of
Registrable Securities as each such Holder may request in writing within two
Business Days after the Holder receives such notice. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Parent has been advised by the Managing Underwriter that the
inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Overnight Underwritten Offering
for the accounts of the Selling Holders is likely to have a material adverse
effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Class A Common Stock, then
the amount of Registrable Securities to be included in the Overnight
Underwritten Offering for the accounts of Selling Holders shall be determined
based on the provisions of _Section 2.02(c)_ of this Agreement. If, at any
time after giving written notice of its intention to execute an Overnight
Underwritten Offering and prior to the closing of such Overnight Underwritten
Offering, Parent determines for any reason not to undertake or to delay such
Overnight Underwritten Offering, Parent shall give written notice of such
determination to the Selling Holders and, (i) in the case of a determination
not to undertake such Overnight Underwritten Offering, shall be relieved of
its obligation to sell any Registrable Securities held by the Selling Holders
in connection with such abandoned or delayed Overnight Underwritten Offering,
and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay such Overnight Underwritten
Offering, shall be permitted to delay offering any Registrable Securities held
by the Selling Holders for the same period as the delay of the Overnight
Underwritten Offering. Any Selling Holder shall have the right to withdraw
such Selling Holders request for inclusion of such Selling Holders
Registrable Securities in such Overnight Underwritten Offering by giving
written notice to Parent of such withdrawal at least one Business Day prior to
the expected Launch Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Holder may
deliver an Opt-Out Notice to Parent requesting that such Holder not receive
notice from Parent of any proposed Overnight Underwritten Offering.

(c) _ _Priority of Rights__. In connection with an Underwritten Offering
and Overnight Underwritten Offering contemplated by _Section 2.02(a)_ and
_Section 2.02(b)_ , respectively, if the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters
of any such Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering, as the
case may be, advises Parent that the total amount of Class A Common Stock that
the Selling Holders and any other Persons intend to include in such
Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering exceeds the number
that can be sold in such Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten
Offering without being likely to have a material adverse effect on the price,
timing or distribution of the Class A Common Stock offered or the market for
the Class A Common Stock, then the Class A Common Stock to be included in such
Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering shall include the
number of shares of Class A Common Stock that such Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters advises Parent can be sold without having such adverse effect
(such maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock, the " _Maximum Number
of Securities_ "), with such number to be allocated (i) first, to Parent,
(ii) second, pro rata among all Selling Holders and holders of any other
securities of Parent having rights of registration on parity with the
Registrable Securities (" _Parity Holders_ ") who have requested
participation in

 



C - 6  such Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering. The pro rata
allocations for each such Selling Holder shall be based on the respective
number of Registrable Securities that each Selling Holder has requested be
included in such Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering and
the aggregate number of Registrable Securities that the Selling Holders have
requested be included in such Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten
Offering.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.02_ to the contrary,
no Holder shall have any right to include any Class A Common Stock in any
offering by Parent of Class A Common Stock executed pursuant to any "at the
market" program that Parent may have in effect from time to time on or after
the date of this Agreement.

(e) The Parent, Bold, and the Bold Unitholders hereby agree that the rights
of (i) Oak Valley Resources, LLC (" _Oak Valley_ ") and its permitted assigns
to register shares of Class A Common Stock under that certain Registration
Rights Agreement dated December 19, 2014 by and among the Parent and Oak
Valley, and (ii) Parallel Resource Partners, LLC (" _PRP_ ") and its
permitted assigns, and Flatonia Energy, LLC (" _Flatonia_ ") and its permitted
assigns, to register shares of Class A Common Stock under the Registration
Rights Agreement dated December 19, 2014 by and among the Parent, PRP, and
Flatonia, shall rank _pari passu_ with the rights of Bold and the Bold
Unitholders to register shares of Class A Common Stock under this Agreement.
For purposes of clarity and the avoidance of doubt, the Parent, Bold and the
Bold Unitholders expressly agree that Oak Valley, PRP, and Flatonia shall be
Parity Holders for purposes of this Section 2.02.

 

Section 2.03 _Underwritten Offering_.

 

(a) In the event that the Selling Holders holding at least $10 million
(subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section 3.04_ ) of Registrable Securities
elect to dispose of Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration
Statement pursuant to an Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten
Offering, (i) Parent shall give notice (including, but not limited to,
notification by electronic mail, with such notice given no later than one
Business Day after Parent engages a Managing Underwriter in the case of a
proposed Overnight Underwritten Offering) of such proposed Underwritten
Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering to the Holders on a Business Day
and such notice shall offer the Holders the opportunity to include in such
Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering such number of shares
of Class A Common Stock as each such Holder may request in writing (within
five Business Days in the case of an Underwritten Offering that is not an
Overnight Underwritten Offering and within two Business Days after the Holder
receives such notice in the case of an Overnight Underwritten Offering) and
(ii) Parent will retain Underwriters (which Underwriters shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Selling Holders holding a majority of the Registrable
Securities to be disposed of pursuant to such Underwritten Offering
or Overnight Underwritten Offering) subject to such sale through an
Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering, including entering
into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Managing Underwriter
or Underwriters, which shall include, among other provisions, indemnities to
the effect and to the extent provided in _Section 2.08_ , and will take all
reasonable actions as are requested by the Managing Underwriter in order to
expedite or facilitate the registration and disposition of the Registrable
Securities. Parent management shall participate in a roadshow or similar
marketing effort on behalf of any such Holder or Holders if gross proceeds
from such Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering
are reasonably expected to exceed $20 million. No Selling Holder may
participate in such Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering
unless such Selling Holder agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the
basis provided in such underwriting agreement and completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities and other documents reasonably
and customarily required under the terms of such underwriting agreement. No
Selling Holder shall be required to make any representations or warranties to
or agreements with Parent or the Underwriters other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such Selling Holder and its ownership of
the securities being registered on its behalf and its intended method of
distribution and any other representations required by law. If any Selling
Holder disapproves of the terms of an underwriting, such Selling Holder may
elect to withdraw therefrom by notice to Parent and the Managing
Underwriter;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such notice of withdrawal must be
made at a time up to and including the time of pricing of such offering in
order to be effective. No such withdrawal or abandonment shall affect Parents
obligation to pay Registration Expenses.

(b) In connection with an Underwritten Offering and Overnight Underwritten
Offering contemplated by _Section 2.03(a)_ , respectively, if the Managing
Underwriter or Underwriters of any such Underwritten Offering or Overnight
Underwritten Offering, as the case may be, advises the Selling Holders that
the total amount of Class A 

 



C - 7  Common Stock that the Selling Holders intend to include in such Underwritten
Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering exceeds the Maximum Number of
Securities, then the Class A Common Stock to be included in such Underwritten
Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering shall include the Maximum Number
of Securities, with such number to be allocated (i) first, pro rata among all
Selling Holders and (ii) second, pro rata among all Parity Holders who have
requested participation in such Underwritten Offering or Overnight
Underwritten Offering. The pro rata allocations for each such Selling Holder
shall be based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
Selling Holder has requested be included in such Underwritten Offering or
Overnight Underwritten Offering and the aggregate number of Registrable
Securities that the Selling Holders have requested be included in such
Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten Offering.

Section 2.04 _Registration Procedures_. In connection with its obligations
under this _Article_ _ _ _II_ , Parent or the applicable Selling Holder, as
the case may be, will, as expeditiously as possible:

then required by the rules and regulations of the SEC), and provide each such
Selling Holder the opportunity to object to any information pertaining to such

statement;

 

(c) if applicable, use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify

the Managing Underwriter, shall reasonably request, _provided_ that Parent

jurisdiction where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action
which would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction
where it is not then so subject;

 

(d) promptly notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter of Registrable
Securities, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be

that the prospectus or prospectus supplement does not include an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in
the light of the circumstances then existing, and to take such other action as
is necessary to remove a stop order, suspension, threat thereof or

(g) in the case of an Underwritten Offering or Overnight Underwritten
Offering, furnish upon request and addressed to the underwriters and to the

independent public accountants (and, if applicable, independent reserve
engineers) who have certified Parents financial statements included or
incorporated by reference into the applicable registration statement, and each
of the opinion and the "comfort letter" shall be in customary form and cover
substantially the same matters with respect to such registration statement
(and the prospectus and any prospectus supplement included therein) as are
customarily covered in opinions of issuers counsel and in accountants (and,
if applicable, independent reserve engineers) letters delivered to the
underwriters in Underwritten Offerings or Overnight Underwritten Offerings of
securities, and such other matters as such underwriters or Selling Holders may
reasonably request;

 

(h) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, and make available to its security holders,
as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering the period
of at least 12 months, but not more than 18 months, beginning with the first

(l) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement not later than the effective date of
such registration statement;

(m) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities;

 



C - 9 (n) if any Selling Holder could reasonably be deemed to be
an "underwriter," as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, in
connection with the registration statement in respect of any registration of
Registrable Securities of such Selling Holder pursuant to this Agreement, and
any amendment or supplement thereof (any such registration statement or
amendment or supplement, a " _Selling Holder Underwriter Registration
Statement_ "), then, until the Effectiveness Period ends, (i) cooperate with
such Selling Holder in allowing such Selling Holder to conduct customary
"underwriters due diligence" with respect to Parent and satisfy its
obligations in respect thereof; (ii) until the Effectiveness Period ends, at
any Selling Holder request, furnish to such Selling Holder, on the date of

supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by _subsection (e)_ of this
_Section 2.04_ or until it is advised in writing by Parent that the use of the
prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so
directed by Parent, such Selling Holder will, or will request the managing
underwriter or underwriters, if any, to deliver to Parent (at
Parents expense) all copies in their possession or control, other than

applicable, to comply with the Securities Act.

Parent gives written notice to such Holder of the date of the commencement and
termination of such period with respect to any such Underwritten Offering or
Overnight Underwritten Offering and (ii) the duration of the foregoing
restrictions shall be no longer than the duration of the shortest restriction
generally imposed by the underwriters of such public sale or distribution on
Parent or on the officers or directors or any other unitholder of Parent on
whom a restriction is imposed; _provided further_ , that this _Section 2.06_

C - 10 Section 2.07 _Expenses_.

 

(a) _ _Certain Definitions__. " _Registration Expenses_ " means all
expenses incident to Parents performance under or compliance with this

securities, other than: (i) transfer taxes and fees of transfer agents and

Section 2.08 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) _ _By Parent__. In the event of a registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, Parent will
indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder, its Affiliates
that own Registrable Securities and their respective directors and officers
and each underwriter pursuant to the applicable underwriting agreement with
such underwriter and each Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder or
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
its directors and officers (collectively, the " _Selling Holder Indemnified
Persons_ "), against any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities
(including reasonable attorneys, accountants and experts fees and expenses)
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), joint or several, to which such Selling Holder
or underwriter or controlling Person may become subject under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in the Shelf Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, any
preliminary prospectus, free writing prospectus or final prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based
upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
the case of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading or arise out of or are based upon a Selling Holder being
deemed to be an "underwriter," as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the
Securities Act, in connection with the registration statement in respect of
any registration of Parents securities, and will reimburse each such Selling
Holder Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss or actions
or proceedings; _provided_ , _however,_ that Parent will not be liable in any
such case if and to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is based
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission so made in strict conformity with information furnished by such
Selling Holder Indemnified Person in writing specifically for use in
the Shelf Registration Statement or such other registration statement or any
prospectus contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereof. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Holder or any such
director, officer or controlling Person, and shall survive the transfer of
such securities by such Selling Holder.

 

(b) _ _By Each Selling Holder__. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and
not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless Parent, its directors and
officers, and each Person, if any, who controls Parent within the meaning of
the Securities Act or of the Exchange Act against any Losses to the same
extent as the foregoing indemnity from Parent to the Selling Holders, but
only with respect to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in
writing by or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in the
Shelf Registration Statement or any prospectus contained therein or
any amendment or supplement thereof relating to the Registrable Securities;
_provided_ , _however,_ that the liability of each Selling Holder shall not be
greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such
Selling Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification.

 



C - 11 (c) _ _Notice__. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder
of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if
a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but such
indemnified partys failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any
indemnified party other than under this _Section 2.08_. The indemnifying party
shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to
assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to
such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party
under this _Section 2.08_ for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) if the indemnifying party has failed to
assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably acceptable to
the indemnified party or (ii) if the defendants in any such action include
both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and counsel to the
indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be reasonable defenses
available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to
those available to the indemnifying party, or if the interests of the
indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of
the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have the right to
select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and otherwise to
participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable expenses and
fees of one such separate counsel (firm) and other reasonable
expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying
party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
indemnified party shall settle any action brought against it with respect to
which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the
indemnifying party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or
obligation on, and includes a complete and unconditional release from all
liability of, the indemnifying party.

 

(d) _ _Contribution__ _._ _ _ If the indemnification provided for in this
_Section 2.08_ is held by a court or government agency of competent
jurisdiction to be unavailable to Parent or any Selling Holder or is
insufficient to hold it harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such
indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such Losses as between Parent, on the one hand, and such Selling Holder, on
the other hand, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of Parent, on the one hand, and of such Selling Holder, on the other, in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations; _provided_ ,  _however,_
that in no event shall such Selling Holder be required to contribute an
aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds received by such
Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification. The relative fault of Parent, on the one hand, and each
Selling Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact has been
made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the parties
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would
not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to
be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation
which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in
the first sentence of this paragraph. The amount paid by an indemnified party
as a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
shall be deemed to include any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any
Loss which is the subject of this paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities
Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who is not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

(e) _ _Other Indemnification__. The provisions of this _Section 2.08_
shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution
which an indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or
otherwise.

 

Section 2.09 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC that may permit the sale
of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, Parent
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to:

 

(a) Make and keep public information regarding Parent available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 (or any successor rule or
regulation to Rule 144 then in force) of the Securities Act, at all times from
and after the Closing Date;

 



C - 12 (b) File with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of Parent under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at
all times from and after the Closing Date;

 

(c) So long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to such
Holder forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of Parent, and such other reports and documents so filed as such Holder
may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC
allowing such Holder to sell any such securities without registration; and

(d) take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to
the extent required from time to time to enable the Holders to sell
Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144 (or any successor rule
or regulation to Rule 144 then in force) under the Securities Act.

Section 2.10 _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights
to cause Parent to include Registrable Securities in a Shelf Registration
Statement may be transferred or assigned by any Holder to one or more
transferee(s) or assignee(s) of such Registrable Securities, _provided_ that
(a) Parent is given written notice prior to any said transfer or assignment,
stating the name and address of each such transferee and identifying the
securities with respect to which such registration rights are being
transferred or assigned, and (b) each such transferee or assignee assumes in
writing responsibility for its portion of the obligations of such Holder under
this Agreement by executing a Joinder in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
A_.

 

Section 2.11 _Information by Holder_. Any Holder or Holders of Registrable
Securities included in any registration statement shall promptly furnish to
Parent such information regarding such Holder or Holders and the distribution
proposed by such Holder or Holders as Parent may reasonably request and as
shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification or
compliance referred to herein.

Section 2.12 _Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights_. From and
after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Holders, enter into any agreement with any current or future
holder of any securities of Parent that would allow such current or future
holder to require Parent to include securities in any Piggyback Offering by
Parent for its own account on a basis that is superior in any material respect
to the Piggyback Offering rights granted to the Holders pursuant to  _Section
2.02_ of this Agreement.

obligations of the Holders under this Agreement may be transferred or

Agreement. Parent may not transfer or assign any portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Registrable Securities.

Section 3.04 _Recapitalization, Exchanges, etc. Affecting the Class A
Common Stock_. The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the full extent
set forth herein with respect to any and all shares of capital stock

be appropriately adjusted for combinations, recapitalizations and the like

Section 3.06 _Specific Performance_. Damages in the event of breach of
this Agreement by a party hereto may be difficult, if not impossible, to
ascertain, and it is therefore agreed that each such Person, in addition to
and without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, will have the
right to an injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any and
all defenses it may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence
of the court to grant such an injunction or other equitable relief. The
existence of this right will not preclude any such Person from pursuing any
other rights and remedies at law or in equity which such Person may have.

 

Section 3.07 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which

convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the
meaning hereof.

Section 3.09 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and construed

the application of any Law other than the Law of the State of Delaware.

Section 3.10 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that
any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder shall be brought and determined exclusively
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such Court does not
have subject matter jurisdiction, to the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware or, if jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the Federal courts of
the United States, the Federal courts of the United States sitting in the
State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any such state or Federal
court, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all claims with
respect to any such claim shall be heard and determined in such Delaware court
or in such Federal court, as applicable. The parties agree that a final
judgment in any such claim is conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 

Section 3.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR
OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE,
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER,
RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT
MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING

OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 3.11_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE
CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

Section 3.12 _Severability of Provisions_. Any provision of this Agreement
which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such

unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting or impairing the validity or enforceability of such provision in
any other jurisdiction.

Section 3.13 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement is intended by the
parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete
and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties
hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no
restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set
forth or referred to herein with respect to the rights granted by Parent set
forth herein. This Agreement and the Contribution Agreement supersede all
prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such
subject matter.

Section 3.14 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by means of
a written amendment signed by Parent and the Holders of a majority of the then
outstanding Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however,_ that no such
amendment shall materially and adversely affect the rights of any Holder
hereunder without the consent of such Holder.

Section 3.15 _No Presumption_. In the event any claim is made by a party
relating to any conflict, omission, or ambiguity in this Agreement, no
presumption or burden of proof or persuasion shall be implied by virtue of the
fact that this Agreement was prepared by or at the request of a
particular party or its counsel.

Section 3.16 _Obligations Limited to Parties to Agreement_. Each of the
Parties hereto covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no Person other than
the Holders (and their transferees or assignees) and Parent shall

 



C - 15  have any obligation hereunder and that, notwithstanding that one or more of
the Holders may be a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, no
recourse under this Agreement shall be had against any former, current or
future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner,
manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any Holder or any former, current
or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner,
manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, whether by
the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or
by virtue of any applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged
that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or
otherwise be incurred by any former, current or future director, officer,
employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or
Affiliate of any Holder or any former, current or future director, officer,
employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing, as such, for any obligations of a Holder
under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of
such obligation or its creation.

Section 3.17 _Independent Nature of Each Holder s Obligations_. The
obligations of each Holder under this Agreement are several and not joint with
the obligations of any other Holder, and no Holder shall be responsible in any
way for the performance of the obligations of any other Holder under this
Agreement. Nothing contained herein, and no action taken by any Holder
pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Holders as a partnership,
an association, a joint venture or any other kind of group or entity,
or create a presumption that the Holders are in any way acting in concert or
as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each Holder shall be entitled to independently protect and
enforce its rights, including without limitation, the rights arising out of
this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Holder to be
joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

 

Section 3.18 _Further Assurances_. Parent and each of the Holders shall
cooperate with each other and shall take such further action and shall
execute and deliver such further documents as may be reasonably requested by
any other party in order to carry out the provisions and purposes of this
Agreement.

contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been validly executed and delivered by
such Stockholder and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Earthstone and the other parties hereto,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Stockholder,
enforceable against such Stockholder in accordance with its terms (except
insofar as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors
rights generally, or by principles governing the availability of equitable
remedies).

 

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder does
not, and the performance of this Agreement by such Stockholder will not, (i)
conflict with the certificate of formation or limited liability company
agreement of such Stockholder as presently in effect, (ii) conflict with or
violate any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to such Stockholder or by which it is bound or affected,
(iii)(A) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that

give to any other person any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, or (C) result in the creation of any pledge, claim, lien,
charge, encumbrance or security interest of any kind or nature whatsoever upon
any of the properties or assets of the Stockholder under, any agreement,
contract, indenture, note or instrument to which such Stockholder is a party
or by which it is bound or affected, except for such breaches, defaults or
other occurrences that would not prevent or materially delay the performance
by such Stockholder of any of such Stockholders obligations under this
Agreement, or (iv) except for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange
Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the
New York Stock Exchange Market (the " _NYSE_ ") or the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), require
any filing by such Stockholder with, or any permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any governmental or regulatory authority, except where the
failure to make such filing or obtain such permit, authorization, consent or
approval would not prevent or materially delay the performance by such
Stockholder of any of such Stockholders obligations under this Agreement.

 

(d) The Shares and the certificates representing the Shares owned by such
Stockholder are held by such Stockholder, or by a nominee or custodian for
the benefit of such Stockholder, free and clear of all pledges, liens,
charges, claims, security interests, proxies, voting trusts or agreements,
understandings or arrangements or any other encumbrances whatsoever, except
for any such encumbrances or proxies arising hereunder or under applicable
federal and state securities laws or under the agreements set forth on
_Schedule B_ hereto. Such Stockholder owns of record or beneficially
no shares of Common Stock other than such Stockholders Shares as set forth
on Schedule A.

(e) As of the date hereof, neither such Stockholder, nor any of its
respective properties or assets is subject to any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award that would prevent or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

hereby represents and warrants to the Stockholders as follows:

(a) Earthstone is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation.

deliver this Agreement, to perform its respective obligations hereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and has taken all
necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Earthstone and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the parties hereto, constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Earthstone, enforceable against
Earthstone in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (except insofar as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally, or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies).

 



Exhibit D - 2 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Earthstone does not,
and the performance of this Agreement by Earthstone will not, (i) conflict
with the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational
documents of Earthstone as presently in effect, (ii) conflict with or
violate any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to Earthstone or by which it is bound or affected, (iii)
(A) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, (B) give to
any other person any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or (C) result in the creation of any pledge, claim, lien,
charge, encumbrance or security interest of any kind or nature whatsoever
upon any of the properties or assets of Earthstone or any of its subsidiaries
under, any agreement, contract, indenture, note or instrument to which
Earthstone or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which Earthstone or any
of its subsidiaries is bound or affected, except for such breaches, defaults
or other occurrences that would not prevent or materially delay the
performance by Earthstone of its obligations under this Agreement, or (iv)
except for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act, the NYSE or the HSR Act, require any filing by Earthstone
with, or any permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any governmental
or regulatory authority, except where the failure to make such filing or
obtain such permit, authorization, consent or approval would not prevent or
materially delay the performance by Earthstone of its obligations under this
Agreement.

 

(c) As of the date hereof, none of Earthstone, its subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets are subject to any order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award that would prevent or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 3. _Covenants of the Stockholders_. The Stockholders, severally
and not jointly, agree as follows:

 

(a) For so long as this Agreement is in effect, such Stockholder shall not
vote any Shares or take any other action that would in any way alter the
composition of Earthstones board of directors from its composition
immediately following the Closing. For purposes of clarity, and the avoidance
of doubt, immediately following the Closing, Earthstones board of directors
shall be composed of nine members, four of which shall be designated by EnCap
(the " _EnCap Designated Directors_ "), three of which shall be independent
(the " _Independent Directors_ "), and two of which shall be members of
Earthstones management, including Earthstones Chief Executive Officer (the "
_Earthstone Designated Directors_ " and, together with the Independent
Directors, the " _Non-EnCap Designated Directors")_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, or any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
during the effectiveness of this Agreement during which EnCaps collective
ownership of Earthstone, beneficially and of record, exceeds 50% of the total
issued and outstanding Common Stock of Earthstone, EnCap may remove and
replace one Non-EnCap Designated Director, and his or her successors, and such
removal will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Earthstones
certificate of incorporation and bylaws then in effect.

 

(b) Such Stockholder shall not, except as contemplated by the terms of this
Agreement (i) enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting
agreement, voting trust, power-of-attorney or otherwise, with respect to the
Shares or (ii) take any other action that would in any way restrict, limit or
interfere with the performance of his, her or its obligations hereunder or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4. _Adjustments Upon Share Issuances, Changes in Capitalization_.
In the event of any change in Common Stock or in the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock by reason of a stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
other similar event or transaction or any other change in the corporate or
capital structure of Earthstone (including, without limitation, the
declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend of cash, securities or
other property), and consequently the number of Shares changes or is
otherwise adjusted, this Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall attach
to any additional shares of Common Stock, stockholder rights or other
securities or rights of Earthstone issued to or acquired by Stockholders.

 



Exhibit D - 3 Section 5. _Further Assurances_. Each Stockholder will, from time
to time, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such
additional or further endorsements, consents and other instruments as
Earthstone may reasonably request for the purpose of effectively carrying out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6. _Termination_. This Agreement, and all rights and obligations
of the parties hereunder, shall terminate upon the earlier of (a) the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date; and (b) the date upon which EnCap, OVR and
Bold collectively own, of record and beneficially, less than 20% of
Earthstones outstanding voting interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
_Section 8_ hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

Section 7. _Action in Stockholder Capacity Only_. Each Stockholder signs
solely in its capacity as the record holder and beneficial owner of, or the
trustee of a trust whose beneficiaries are the beneficial owners of,
such Stockholders Shares and nothing herein shall limit or affect any
actions or omissions taken by or fiduciary duties of, a Stockholder or any of
its affiliates, in its, his or her, as applicable, capacity as an officer or
director of Earthstone to the extent permitted by applicable law.

Section 8. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

 

(c) _Amendments_. This Agreement may not be amended except by Earthstone
and all Stockholders by an instrument in writing signed by Earthstone and the
Stockholders and in compliance with applicable law. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties agree that, in the
event that listing standards or rules promulgated by the NYSE or regulations
or guidelines promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission require
modification to the size of Earthstones board of directors, the parties will
modify or amend this Agreement as reasonably necessary to ensure compliance
with such requirements.

this Agreement without the posting of any bond or security in addition to any
other remedy at law or equity.

(j) _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated.

 

(k) _Several Liability._ _ _ Each party to this Agreement enters into this

aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above
named courts, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the service of process in
accordance with _Section 5.3_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
