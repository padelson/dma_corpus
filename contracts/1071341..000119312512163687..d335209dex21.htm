representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

 

1.1. _The Merger_.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the TBOC, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.

 

1.2. _Closing; Effective Time_.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Article VIII, the closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") shall take place (i) at the offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P.,
1001 Fannin St., Houston, Texas 77002, at 9:00 a.m. local time, on the third
(3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VIII (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions). The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ".

(b) At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_
") with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas (the " _Secretary of
State_ "), in such form as required by and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the TBOC. The Merger shall become effective on such
date and at such time as the Certificate of Merger is filed with the
Secretary of State or at such later time (or subsequent date and time) as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ").

1.3. _Effect of the Merger_.

The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable
provisions of the TBOC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all property, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and authority of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and
duties of the Surviving Corporation, all without any transfer or assignment
having occurred.

1.4. _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder thereof:

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Capital Stock at the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive $8.85 in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

 



2 (b) Each share of Company Capital Stock that is (i) owned by the Company (as
treasury stock or otherwise) or any of its Subsidiaries, other than such
shares of Company Capital Stock beneficially owned and held of record by a
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company in its proprietary trading account as
set forth in Section 1.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, immediately
prior to the Effective Time or (ii) owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of doubt, each share
of Company Capital Stock contributed to Parent by the Rollover Investors in
accordance with the Rollover Contribution Agreements (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ "), shall be automatically cancelled and retired and cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be paid with respect to the Excluded
Shares.

(c) All shares of the Company Capital Stock converted pursuant to Section
1.4(a) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and cease to exist, and each certificate representing any such
shares of Company Capital Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each such
uncertificated share of Company Capital Stock (each, an " _Uncertificated
Share_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time was registered to a
holder on the stock transfer books of the Company, shall from and after the
Effective Time represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 1.4(a).

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock shall occur as a result of any stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or combination, or any stock dividend or stock distribution
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of Company Capital Stock) is declared with a record
date during such period, then the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

1.5. _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_.

 

Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

1.6. _Dissenting Shares_.

Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, shares of
Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time
and that are held by a shareholder who has not voted such shares in favor of
the Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly demands the fair value
of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with (and has
otherwise taken all of the steps required by) Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of
the TBOC to properly exercise and perfect such shareholderÂ’s rights of dissent
and appraisal (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be deemed to have ceased to
represent any interest in the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time
and shall be entitled to those rights and remedies set forth in Subchapter H
of Chapter 10 of the TBOC; provided, however, that in the event that a
shareholder of the Company fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any
such right or remedy granted by the TBOC, the shares of Company Capital Stock
held by such shareholder shall be converted into and represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4(a). The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written notices to exercise
dissentersÂ’ rights in respect of any shares of Company Capital Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such notices, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company with respect to
shareholdersÂ’ rights of dissent and appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands for payment of fair value under the TBOC. The Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment of fair
value under the TBOC.

 



3 ARTICLE II

_EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

2.1. _Paying Agent_.

 

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a paying agent mutually
agreeable to the Company and Parent to act as paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. On the Closing Date and
prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall deposit or
shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, in a separate
fund established for the benefit of the holders of shares of the Company
Capital Stock for payment in accordance with this Article II, immediately
available funds constituting an amount equal to the Merger Consideration that
is payable in respect of all shares of Company Capital Stock (such aggregate
amount as deposited with the Paying Agent, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.4 out of the Payment Fund. The
Payment Fund shall be invested in short-term obligations of the United States
of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by
the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation,
respectively; provided, however, that any interest or other income resulting
from the investment of the Payment Fund shall be solely for the account of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation. If for any reason (including losses) the
Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of
Company Capital Stock are entitled under Section 1.4, Parent shall take all
steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to
deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments
required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. Parent shall pay all charges and expenses of the
Paying Agent in connection with the exchange of shares for the Merger
Consideration.

2.2. _Payment Procedures_.

 

As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) a letter
of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in customary form
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent, and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the applicable
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to
the product of (a) the number of shares of Company Capital Stock, as the case
may be, represented by such Certificate multiplied by (b) the Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Any holder of Uncertificated Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration, and, upon adherence to
those procedures established by the Paying Agent, such holder of
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash
in an amount equal to the product of (1) the number of Uncertificated Shares
held by such holder multiplied by (2) the Merger Consideration. No interest
will be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
shares of Company Capital Stock.

 



4 2.3. _No Further Ownership Rights_.

 

All cash paid as Merger Consideration upon the surrender of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the applicable
shares of Company Capital Stock.

2.4. _No Liability_.

Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Company Capital Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holders of Company Capital Stock who have not theretofore complied
with the provisions of this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for satisfaction of their claims for such Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration payable to the holder of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall become the
property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made
available to the Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall, upon
demand, be returned to Parent.

2.5. _Lost Certificates_.

 

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock, as the case
may be, formerly represented thereby, pursuant to this Agreement.

2.6. _Withholding Rights_.

 

Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from consideration otherwise payable pursuant

copies of (i) an executed equity commitment letter from the Guarantors to
provide $132,000,000 (without limiting the provisions of Section 7.9 of this

increase or decrease does not cause the representation in Section 5.9 to be
untrue) in equity financing (the " _Equity Financing_ ") to Parent and/or
Merger Sub (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), (ii) an executed contribution
agreement from each Rollover Investor (the " _Rollover Contribution
Agreements_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of
which, the Rollover Investors have committed to contribute to Parent, the

Merger Sub with loans or other funds in an aggregate amount of $189,947,784

therein, the proceeds of which may be used to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payoff
amount and related fees and expenses including the expenses incurred by Parent
and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect, and (ii) in the form so delivered, is a

may be redacted to remove fee amounts, percentages and basis points). As of
the date of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub under any term or condition of the Financing
Commitments, and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub has knowledge of any facts
or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in (1) any of the
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments not being satisfied or (2)

contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date. Parent and or Merger Sub

or of record) any shares of capital stock of the Company and, except as

relating to or affecting creditorÂ’s rights, and to general equitable
principles regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity) and has not been amended, withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which,

to result in a default on the part of the Guarantors under the Limited
Guarantee.

None of Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective "interested persons"
(as that term is defined under applicable provisions of the Investment
Company Act) has any express or implied understanding or arrangement which

Investment Company Act) on any Proprietary Fund that is a Registered
Investment Company for purposes of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act
as a result of the Merger or which would in any way cause Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act to be unavailable to the Company. 

5.13. _Investigation by Parent and Merger Sub_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has made its
own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their

documents and information from the Company as each such party considers
material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement and to

from the Company or its Representatives certain estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information regarding the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations. Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information
with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, and that Parent and Merger Sub
are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy
and accuracy of all such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information so furnished to them.

5.14. _Solvency; Surviving Corporation After the Merger_.

Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors. Assuming that the representations and warranties
of the Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all
material respects, at and immediately after the Effective Time, and after
giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,

at a fair valuation and at fair saleable value; (ii) the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will have the ability to pay
their total debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated,

of their business; and (iii) the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital with which to conduct their business.

5.15.  _No Vote Required_.

No vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock or
other equity interest of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement, the
Merger, or the Financing. The vote or consent of Parent as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub (which has been obtained) is the only vote or
consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock or other
equity interest of Merger Sub necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement,
the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



35 5.16. _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

reasonable best efforts to promptly respond (after consultation with Parent)
to any comments or requests for additional information from the SEC with

opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving due consideration to
such comments.

(b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or

light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the

the contrary contained in this Agreement notwithstanding, the Board of
Directors of the Company or the Special Committee may effect a Change of
Recommendation if the Special Committee determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, afford to Parent and its officers, directors and Representatives,

any of its Subsidiaries has material financial arrangements (a " _Significant
Person_ ")), properties and personnel as Parent, the Financing Sources, or
their respective Representatives may reasonably request. The Company shall

of which the Company has Knowledge that would reasonably be expected to (a)
materially delay or impair the consummation of the Merger or (b) have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall respond reasonably promptly
to any written inquiry from Parent as to any material developments relating
to the business and/or operations of the Company. Upon the request of Parent,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to obtain from any Significant Person information regarding such
Significant Person that is material to its arrangements with the Company or
its Subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to disclose information to the extent such information is subject
to an attorney client or attorney work product privilege or to the extent
that such disclosure would, in the CompanyÂ’s good faith opinion after
consultation with legal counsel, violate any applicable Law or any
confidentiality obligation to a third party by which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound; provided, that the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to limit such restrictions. In the event that the Company does
not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it
shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or
information and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that
would not violate the applicable Law or confidentiality obligation. To the
extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is restricted in or prohibited
from providing any such access pursuant to confidentiality obligations owed to
a third party under any Contract or agreement, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts (without being required to make any payments or other
concessions to such third party) to obtain any approval, consent or waiver
with respect to such contract or agreement that is necessary to provide
such access. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not have access to
personnel records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
sensitive information that in the CompanyÂ’s good faith opinion the disclosure
of which would reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to risk of liability. Parent agrees that it will

 



40  not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained
pursuant to this Section 7.2 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties will hold any
such information in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance
with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 14,
2011, by and between Lee Equity Partners, LLC and the Company (as amended,
the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

7.3. _Competing Proposal Consideration_. 

(a) During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m. Central time on May 26, 2012 (the " _Go-Shop Period End
Date_ "), the Company and its Subsidiaries and its Representatives, shall have
the right, under the direction of the Special Committee, to: (i) solicit,
initiate, facilitate or encourage the submission of any Competing Proposal
(ii) furnish non-public information to and afford access to the business,
employees, officers, Contracts, properties, assets, books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant to the prior execution of
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided that the Company shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within two (2) Business
Days or, in the case such information is provided to a Person after the
beginning of the Notice Period in Section 7.3(d), concurrently therewith)
provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company
or its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to any such Person (or
its Representatives) which had not previously been provided or made available
to Parent; (iii) enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Competing Proposal and (iv) otherwise cooperate
with or assist or participate in or facilitate any discussions or
negotiations or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or could be reasonably expected to
result in, a Competing Proposal. Within two (2) Business Days following the
Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of all
Persons from whom the Company received, after the date hereof and prior to the
Go-Shop Period End Date (each, a " _Go-Shop Party_ "), a written Competing
Proposal that the Special Committee in good faith determines (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) is bona fide
and constitutes, or could be reasonably expected to result in a Superior
Proposal.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by Section 7.3(c), the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its Representatives to: (i) as of 11:59 p.m.
Central time on the Go-Shop Period End Date, immediately cease any existing
solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be
ongoing with respect to any Competing Proposal or any proposal that could be
reasonably expected to result in a Competing Proposal (and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to have all copies of all material non-public
information it or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives have
distributed or made available since the date hereof to Persons in connection
with their consideration of any Competing Proposal (other than with respect to
Parent and its Affiliates), destroyed or returned to the Company as soon as
possible); and (ii) from and after 11:59 p.m. Central time on the Go-Shop
Period End Date until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any,
on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, the Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly through any Person, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly
facilitate or knowingly encourage any Competing Proposal, (B) furnish to
any Person any material non-public information in connection with any
Competing Proposal, (C) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person
with respect to any Competing Proposal, (D) approve or recommend any Competing
Proposal or (E) enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement
in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share
exchange agreement, option agreement, or similar document or any agreement or
commitment relating to any Competing Proposal or enter into any contract or
agreement in principle that is intended or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement as permitted in accordance with Section 7.3(c)).

 



41 (c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 7.3(b), if at any
time after the Go-Shop Period End Date, but prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
Representatives receives a Competing Proposal that did not result from a
material breach of any provision of Section 7.3(b) and that the Special
Committee in good faith determines (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and its financial advisors) constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (i) furnish
non-public information and afford access to the business, employees, officers,
Contracts, properties, assets, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the third party making such Competing Proposal, if, and only
if, prior to so furnishing such information or affording such access, the
Company receives from such third party a signed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (ii) enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations with
such third party with respect to the Competing Proposal; provided, however,
that as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event, within two (2)
Business Days) following the Special Committee of the Company making such
determination, the Company shall provide written notice to Parent of such
Competing Proposal; provided, further, (A) such notice to Parent shall
indicate in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of, such Competing
Proposal, and (B) thereafter, the Company shall promptly provide to Parent
copies of any proposed definitive agreements received in connection with such
Competing Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
reasonably prompt basis of the status and details of any such Competing
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right (i)
to waive the provisions of any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to permit
a Go-Shop Party to make a Competing Proposal on a non-public basis to
the Company and its Board of Directors or the Special Committee, (ii) to
continue to engage in the activities described in Section 7.3(a) following the
Go-Shop Period End Date with any Go-Shop Party until 11:59 p.m. Central time
on June 15, 2012 (such date as may be extended pursuant to Section 7.3(d),
the " _Cut-Off Date_ "), and (iii) to engage in the activities described in
this Section 7.3(c) with respect to any Person, including a Person that was
previously a Go-Shop Party, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Section 7.3(c).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the Required
Shareholder Approval if the Company receives a Competing Proposal that did not
result from a material breach of any provision of Section 7.3(b) or (c) and
that the Board of Directors of the Company (with the concurrence of a majority
of the Special Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its or the Special CommitteeÂ’s financial advisors)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (i) effect a Change of Recommendation and/or
(ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors may not effect a Change of Recommendation relating to a Superior
Proposal pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) unless (A) the Company shall have
provided prior written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent
and Merger Sub, at least three (3) Business Days in advance of such Change of
Recommendation or such termination (such minimum period, the " _Notice
Period_ "), of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation in response
to such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice
shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal), (B) the
Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during such Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby so that such Competing Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal and (C) in the event of any material amendment to such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall be required to provide Parent with a new Notice of
Superior Proposal consistent with the Notice of Superior Proposal described in
clause (A) and the Notice Period shall have recommenced, except the Notice
Period shall be two (2) calendar days (rather than the three (3) Business Days
contemplated by clause (A) above). In the event the Company provides Parent
with the initial Notice of Superior Proposal prior to the Cut-Off Date, the
Cut-Off Date shall be extended until the next calendar day after the final day
of the Notice Period (as the same may have been recommenced pursuant to this
Section 7.3(d)) ends.

 



42 (e) None of the Company, the Special Committee, or the CompanyÂ’s Board of
Directors (or any of their Representatives) shall provide to any third party,
whether or not such party is a Go Shop Party, access to or copies of (i) any
of the documents or sections thereof set forth on Section 7.3(e) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter (the " _Sponsor-Prepared Materials"_ ) or (ii) any
assumptions made by the Sponsor and the financial analyses resulting from such
assumptions contained in the Sponsor-Prepared Materials; provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 7.3(e) shall prohibit or restrict the Company,
the Special Committee, the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors or any of their
respective Representatives from providing to any third party (x) access to or
copies of any of the documents or information the Company, the Special
Committee, the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors or any of their respective
Representatives have provided to the Sponsor or its Representatives (including
through the electronic data room), regardless of whether any such information
is included in the Sponsor-Prepared Materials and (y) assistance or other
cooperation in (1) collecting and analyzing any publicly available information
or (2) preparing any assumptions or analyses regarding the Company or its
business, in each case regardless of whether any such publicly-available
information, assumptions or analysis are similar to those included in the
Sponsor-Prepared Materials as long as Sponsor-Prepared Materials are not used
in connection therewith.

(f) As used in this Agreement,

 

(i) the term " _Competing Proposal_ " means any written bona fide proposal
made by a third party relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of assets or operations that represent twenty five percent (25%) or
more of the revenues or earnings of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or twenty five percent (25%) or more of the combined voting power of
the shares of Company Capital Stock, any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning twenty five
percent (25%) or more of the combined voting power of the shares of Company
Capital Stock or any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which the other party thereto or its
shareholders will own twenty five percent (25%) or more of the combined
voting power of the parent entity resulting from any such transaction, other
than transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(ii) the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means a Competing Proposal that the
Special Committee in good faith determines (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is (A) more favorable to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders (other
than the Rollover Investors) from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated hereby, after taking into account all relevant
factors as the Special Committee considers to be appropriate, but which shall
include all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in writing in response to such proposal after ParentÂ’s
receipt of the applicable Notice of Superior Proposal) and (B) reasonably
capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; provided
that, for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to
"twenty five percent (25%) or more" in the definition of Competing Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "more than fifty percent (50%)"; and

(iii) the term " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a
confidentiality agreement that contains confidentiality and standstill
provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement may include provisions that are less
favorable in

 



43  the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, so long as the Company offers to amend the Confidentiality
Agreement concurrently with the execution of such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement to include such less favorable provisions substantially similar to
those in the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company, the Board
of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee from (i) taking and
disclosing to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders a position contemplated by 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Board of Directors of
the Company or the Special Committee has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with any applicable Law; provided, that disclosures under this
Section 7.3(g) shall not be a basis, in themselves, for Parent to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f).

7.4. _Efforts; Cooperation_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to, and the Company shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts to, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents, and (ii) to obtain all approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Entity necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger

Date in the same manner as conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (x)
each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days of the date hereof and to respond as promptly as

material pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary,
proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable and (y) the Company
and its Subsidiaries agree to provide notice of and apply for approval of
change of control to FINRA under FINRA Rule 1017 as promptly as practicable
and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof and to
respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional information
and documentary material made by FINRA pursuant to such rule.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 7.4(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all material respects with each other in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry; (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Entity,
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the
other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each
other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any
other Governmental Entity and, to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or
such other applicable Governmental Entity, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and

 



44  conferences. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Antitrust Law_ " means
the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and
foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative
and judicial doctrines and other Laws that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through
merger or acquisition.

(c) In the event that any objections are asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ, any other applicable Governmental
Entity or any third party challenging the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Law or which would otherwise prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company shall cooperate in all respects with Parent
and Merger Sub and shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such
objections or to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates shall be required to, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries may not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, become subject, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer,
divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion
of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) conduct, restrict,
operate, invest or otherwise change the assets, business or portion of
business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries in any manner, or (iii) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, if, in any
such case, the effect of any such requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order, individually or in the aggregate, would or
could reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the business
operations of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, as combined in the manner currently intended by the parties;
provided that if requested by Parent, the Company will become subject to,
consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect
to, any such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or
order.

(e) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to obtain consents
of all third parties necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that, in connection
with obtaining such consents, the Company shall not (A) be required to make
any payments of money to any third parties or (B) modify or amend any
Contracts referenced in Section 7.4(f) to provide for increased fees or other
terms adverse to the Company, and (ii) to provide any notices to third parties
required to be provided prior to the Effective Time, including under any
Leases or insurance policies.

 

(f)

(i) Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to each Advisory Agreement
for which the consent of a Client to the assignment or deemed assignment of
such Advisory Agreement as a result of the Merger is required by applicable
Law and/or by the terms of such Advisory Agreement (other than Clients that
are Investment Companies), as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof, the Company shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of the Company to, send
a written notice (a 

 



45  " _Contract Notice_ ") informing such Clients of the Merger and requesting
written consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of such ClientÂ’s
Advisory Agreement (including any approvals by way of "negative consent" to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and the Advisory Agreements of any
Clients) in accordance with Section 7.4(f)(ii) (the " _Client Consent Request
Process_ "). All Contract Notices and related materials distributed to
Clients shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, and
Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review all such Contract
Notices prior to distribution and to have its reasonable comments reflected
therein. The Company shall make available to Parent copies of all substantive
correspondence between it or any of its Subsidiaries and Clients (or their
representatives or counsel) relating to the consent solicitation provided for
in this Section 7.4(f).

(ii) Parent and Company agree that any Consent required for any Advisory
Agreement with a Client (other than a Proprietary Fund) to continue after the
Closing shall be deemed given for all purposes under this Agreement (A) if
written consent is required under applicable Law or the respective
Advisory Agreement, upon receipt of the written consent requested in the
Contract Notice prior to the Closing Date or (B) if consent other than written
consent is permitted under applicable Law and the respective Advisory
Agreement, (x) upon receipt of a written consent requested in the Contract
Notice prior to the Closing Date or (y) if no such written consent is
received, if 45 days shall have passed since the sending of the Contract
Notice (" _Negative Consent Notice_ ") to such Client (which Negative Consent
Notice may be included in the Contract Notice) requesting written consent as
aforesaid and informing such Client: (I) of the intention to complete the
Merger, which will result in a deemed assignment of such ClientÂ’s Advisory
Agreement; (II) of the SubsidiaryÂ’s intention to continue to provide the
advisory services pursuant to the existing Advisory Agreement with such Client
after the Closing if such Client does not terminate such agreement prior to
the Closing; and (III) that the consent of such Client will be deemed to have
been granted if such Client continues to accept such advisory services for a
period of at least 45 days after the sending of the Negative Consent Notice
without termination; provided that, in any case under clause (A) or (B), no
consent shall be deemed to have been given for any purpose under this
Agreement if at any time prior to the Closing such Client indicates, either
orally or in writing, that such Client (1) has not so consented or has
terminated or intends to withdraw its consent or terminate, in whole or in
part, its Advisory Agreement or (2) intends to terminate its Advisory
Agreement or withdraw assets thereunder unless the fees payable under such
Arrangement are reduced.

(iii) For each Client that is registered as an Investment Company under the
Investment Company Act (a " _Registered Investment Company_ "), the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain in accordance with Section 15 of
the Investment Company Act, as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof, the due consideration and approval by the board of trustees of the
Registered Investment Company of a new Advisory Agreement, to be in effect as
of, and subject to, the Closing, on terms no less favorable than the terms of
each existing Advisory Agreement as of the date hereof. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to comply
with all conditions of Rule 15a-4 promulgated under the Investment Company
Act in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
comply with the conditions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act with
respect to each Registered Investment Company.

(iv) For each Client that is an Investment Company but not a Registered
Investment Company, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
in accordance with the constituent documents of such Investment Company and
applicable Law, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the
consent and approval (as applicable) of any governing body of such Investment
Company and of its investors required by such constituent documents and
applicable Law of either (a) the continuation of each Advisory Agreement
between each Subsidiary of the Company and such Investment Company to the
assignment or deemed assignment of such Advisory Agreement as a result of the
Merger (to the extent any such agreement may continue in effect following the
Merger with

 



46  such consent) or (b) a new Advisory Agreement between each Subsidiary of the
Company and such Investment Company (to the extent the existing Advisory
Agreement will terminate as a result of the Merger), in each case (x) to be
in effect with each Subsidiary of the Company as of, and subject to, the
Closing, and (y) on terms no less favorable to such Subsidiary than the terms
of such existing Advisory Agreement with such Investment Company. The manner
of consent and approval solicited with respect to each such Investment Company
that is not a Registered Investment Company shall be reasonably acceptable to
Parent, and all solicitation and related materials distributed in connection
with the consents and approvals described in this paragraph shall be in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and Parent shall be provided a
reasonable opportunity to review all such solicitation and related materials
prior to distribution and to have its reasonable comments reflected therein.

(v) With respect to each of the foregoing Clients where the relationship
between a Subsidiary of the Company and the ultimate underlying Client is
through a financial intermediary (e.g., a "wrap" sponsor or managed account
program sponsor) (each, a " _Program Sponsor_ "), the Company shall, or shall
cause such Subsidiary to, send a separate written notice to each Program
Sponsor informing such Program Sponsor of the Merger and (A) requesting
written consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Program
SponsorÂ’s master agreement (the " _Master Agreement_ ") with each Subsidiary
of the Company resulting from the Merger (where such Master Agreement may by
its terms and under applicable Law remain in effect following consummation of
the Merger with such consent of the Program Sponsor), or (B) requesting such
Program Sponsor to enter into a new Master Agreement with each Subsidiary of
the Company (where the existing Master Agreement will terminate as a result
of the Merger by its terms or under applicable Law) to be in effect with each
such Subsidiary as of, and subject to, the Closing on terms substantially
identical (and identical with respect to fee rates) to the terms of
each SubsidiaryÂ’s existing Master Agreement with such Program Sponsor. All
notices and related materials distributed to Program Sponsors shall be in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, and Parent shall be provided a
reasonable opportunity to review all such notices prior to distribution and
to have its reasonable comments reflected therein. The Company shall make
available to Parent copies of all substantive correspondence between it or any
of its Subsidiaries and Program Sponsors (or their representatives or
counsel) relating to the consent solicitation provided for in this Section
7.4(f).

 

(vi) With respect to all other Clients not addressed by the foregoing
paragraphs of this Section 7.4(f), as promptly as practicable following the
date hereof, Parent shall request the consent of such Clients pursuant to the
Client Consent Request Process.

 

7.5. _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) During the one year period commencing on the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to employees of the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries who remain employees of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ")
employee benefits (other than equity based incentive compensation plans) that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits (other
than equity based or other incentive compensation plans) being provided to the
Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company
Benefit Plans. During the one year period commencing on the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to Company Employees
annual salaries that are not substantially less than the annual salaries
provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



47 (b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, accrual and level of benefits under
any employee benefit plans of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company,
the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates (and any
additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing, to the
same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to
credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan; provided,
however, that no such service credit shall result in any duplication of
benefits with respect to any service period. With respect to any New Plan
which is a group health plan, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause such plan to provide credit for any co-
payments or deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the Company
Employees under any comparable Company Benefit Plan during the year in which
Closing occurs and waive all pre-existing condition exclusions. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Company Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate in the New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the replacement.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) amend, or be deemed to be an
amendment, modification to, or creation of, any Company Benefit Plan by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, (ii) be deemed to be an assumption by Parent of
any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) provide any Person not a party to this
Agreement with any right, benefit or remedy with regard to (A) any Company
Benefit Plan, (B) employment or continued employment or provision of services
for any specified period, or (C) except as expressly provided in Section 10.1,
the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement as a third party
beneficiary or otherwise or (iv) except as expressly provided in this Section
7.5, limit in any way the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
amend, terminate or modify any Company Benefit Plan (subject to the terms of
the applicable Company Benefit Plan as in effect on the date hereof) or any
New Plans, at any time, in accordance with its terms.

7.6. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current
directors and officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective articles of association, certificates of incorporation or by-laws
(or comparable organization documents) or in any written indemnification
agreement in effect as of the date hereof shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and advance expenses to Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by
them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time,
solely to the extent required by (i) the Organizational Documents as in effect
on the date of this Agreement and (ii) any indemnification agreements of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement and true,
correct and complete copies of which have been provided to Parent as of the
date hereof.

 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 7.6(a), during the period
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and
from any costs or expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A)
any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such IndemniteeÂ’s
capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (B) the Merger, this Agreement and any
transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the final
disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the
expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it
shall ultimately be

 



48  determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any settlement
effected without ParentÂ’s or the Surviving CorporationÂ’s prior written
consent; and provided further, however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to)
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise
seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation for which indemnification has been sought under this Section
7.6(b) unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of the applicable Indemnitee from all liability arising
out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or such
Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination. 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to) obtain a six-year pre-paid "tail
policy" from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
CompanyÂ’s current insurance carrier with respect to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance covering acts or omissions at or prior to the Effective
Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the current
policies of the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance maintained by
the Company (the " _Current D andO Policy_") with such coverage levels no less
favorable to such indemnified persons than those of the Current DandO Policy;
provided, that (i) such "tail" insurance policies shall not require the
payment of an aggregate annual premium in excess of two hundred percent (200%)
of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof to maintain the Current DandO Policy (and if the annual premium of
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Company, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount) and (ii) prior to
the Closing, the Company shall not enter into any Contract for a "tail" policy
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Company and/or the
Surviving Corporation shall for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time the Current DandO Policy with coverage levels not materially less favorable
to such indemnified persons than that provided as of the date hereof, or the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable policies of directorsÂ’
and officersÂ’ liability insurance for such six (6)-year period with
coverage levels not materially less favorable as provided under the Current
DandO Policy as of the date hereof; provided, however, that neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium
for such policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance in excess
of two hundred percent (200%) of the aggregate annual premium most recently
paid by the Company prior to the date hereof to maintain the Current DandO
Policy (and if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount).

 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this Section 7.6 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 7.6. The provisions of this Section 7.6 are
intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee, his or her successors,
heirs or representatives.

 

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.6.

 



49 7.7. _Public Announcements_.

 

Each of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent will not make, or permit any of its
Affiliates to make, any public release or announcement concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required
by Law or exchange listing requirements to which the relevant party is
subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
consult with the other party, and allow each other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

7.8.  _Further Assurances_.

At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and
to take any other actions and do any other things, in the name and on behalf
of the Company, reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing,
the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent
to permit the hedge described on Section 7.8 of the Parent Disclosure Letter
to be transferred and assigned to, and assumed by, the Company immediately
prior to the Closing.

7.9.  _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to and shall cause its
Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Financing Commitments (or on terms no less favorable to
Parent and Merger Sub), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained in the Financing Commitments; (ii) enforce its rights to cause the
Lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to fund the Financing
required to consummate the Merger at or prior to the Closing (it being
understood that nothing herein shall require Parent to commence any litigation
or arbitration against any such Lenders or other Persons providing such Debt
Financing or the Receivables Purchaser in order to cause the Debt Financing to
be funded or the Receivables Sale Transaction to be consummated); and (iii)
consummate the Financing no later than the Closing; provided that Parent may
agree to or permit any amendment, modification or waiver of the Financing
Commitments that would not, or would not reasonably be expected to (1)
materially adversely impact (x) the ability of Parent to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) the likelihood of
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (2) expand
upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Financing
Commitments; provided further that Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company copies of any such amendment, modification or waiver following the
execution of the same. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing
Commitments or the Financing Commitments shall be terminated, (A) Parent shall
promptly notify the Company and (B) Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (" _Alternative Debt Financing_ "), on terms
that are not materially less favorable from the standpoint of Parent and
Merger Sub than the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing
Commitments, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, including entering into definitive

 



50  agreements with respect thereto (such definitive agreements entered into
pursuant to the first or second sentence of this Section 7.9(a) being referred
to as the " _Financing Agreements_ "). Parent shall furnish complete, correct
and executed copies of the Financing Agreements to the Company promptly after
execution thereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their
Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to comply with the terms, and
satisfy on a timely basis the conditions, in each case those that are within
their control, of the Financing Commitments, any Alternative Debt Financing,
the Financing Agreements and any related fee and engagement letters. Parent
shall (x) keep the Company informed of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing (or any replacement thereof) and (y) give the Company prompt
notice (1) of any breach by Parent or any breach by any other party thereto
of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware of any of the Financing
Commitments, any alternative financing commitments, or the Financing
Agreements, or any termination thereof or (2) if, for any reason, Parent no
longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments or
Financing Agreements on the terms described therein. Parent shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent
of the Company, take or fail to take any action or enter into any transaction,
including any merger, acquisition, joint venture, disposition, lease, contract
or debt or equity financing, with the intent to impair or delay or prevent
consummation of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments or any
Alternative Debt Financing.

(b) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to assist with, and
cooperate in connection with, the arrangement of the Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub on its own behalf or on behalf
of the Financing Sources. Such cooperation by the Company shall include, but
is not limited to, at the reasonable request of Parent (i) entering into the
Financing Agreements (including causing SPEADV to enter into a purchase
agreement and an assignment and assumption agreement on the terms set forth in
the Receivables Commitment Letter, in each case duly approved, executed and
delivered and enforceable against SPEADV) and such other agreements as may
be reasonably requested, and to use reasonable best efforts to deliver such
officerÂ’s certificates and other documents, as are customary in financings of
such type and as are, in the good faith determination of the Persons executing
such officerÂ’s certificates and other documents, accurate, and agreeing to
pledge, grant and perfect security interests in, and otherwise grant liens on,
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to such agreements as
may be reasonably requested, provided that no obligation of the Company under
any such agreement, pledge or grant shall be effective until the Effective
Time and (ii) providing to the lenders specified in the Financing Commitments
(or any Alternative Debt Financing), including the Receivables Purchaser,
financial and other information in the CompanyÂ’s possession with respect to
the Merger reasonably requested by such lenders, making the CompanyÂ’s senior

lenders specified in the Financing Commitments (or any Alternative Debt
Financing), including the Receivables Purchaser, and otherwise reasonably

(A) using reasonable best efforts to obtain legal opinions, customary landlord
lien and access waivers and deposit and investment account control agreements
and other definitive documentation in connection with the Debt Financing, (B)
assisting Parent and the Financing Sources in the preparation of appropriate
and customary information memoranda (including providing customary
authorization letters, containing a customary representation and warranty on
no misleading information and authorizing distribution of information to
prospective lenders including diligence materials) and similar documents in
connection with the Debt Financing, (C) authorizing any existing lenders or
agent for such lenders to disclose any information with respect to the
Company and its subsidiaries to Parent and Merger Sub (including, but not
limited to, any field examinations, appraisals, and legal documents) which
authorization shall be on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, (D) providing all financial statement and other information that are
required in connection with the Debt Financing (including the timely delivery
of the financial information required to be delivered under the Debt
Financing Commitment or pursuant to any Alternative Debt Financing) and the
Receivables Sale Transaction, (E) senior management and

secured financing transaction or receivables sale transaction, as applicable,
and is available to the Company on a commercially reasonable basis, (I)

shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
except that Parent and Merger Sub, and the arrangers under the
Financing Commitments, shall be permitted to disclose such information to
their Representatives or potential syndicate members (including customary
"click-through" confidentiality undertakings on IntraLinks, R.R. Donnelley
Venue, SyndTrak and similar electronic data sites) during syndication,
subject to customary confidentiality undertakings by such potential syndicate
members. Parent (x) shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that
the agreements contained in this Section 9.4 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. If a party fails

reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually
incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with any action (including the filing of
any lawsuit) taken to collect payment of such amounts.

(f) Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges that neither the payment
of the amounts by the Company nor the payment of the amounts by Parent
specified in this Section 9.4 is a penalty, but in each case is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or
the Company, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fees are
payable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement other

limited partners, shareholders, managers, employees, Representatives, members,
directors, officers, Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or

Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future
shareholders, managers, employees, representatives, members, directors,

68 10.13. _Amendments_.

 

This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, but, after any such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law or in accordance with the
applicable NASDAQ rules requires further approval by such shareholders without
such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sections 9.4(d),
9.4(h), 10.1, 10.6, 10.7, 10.13 and 10.17 hereof (and any provision of this
Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver or termination of
such provision would modify the substance of Sections 9.4(d), 9.4(h), 10.1,
10.6, 10.7, 10.13 and 10.17 hereof) may not be amended, modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to any of the
Financing Sources providing the Debt Financing without the prior written
consent of the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letters.

 

10.14. _Waiver_.

At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company
Shareholders Meeting, any party hereto may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the covenants, obligations or other acts of any other
party hereto or (ii) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties
or compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions of any other
party or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its
duly authorized officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect
to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with
respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

 

10.15. _Limitation of Liability_.

Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that each of them has no right of
recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in each case with
respect to damages of the Parent or its Affiliates, any of the respective
former, current or future shareholders, managers, employees, Representatives,
members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents of the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries (the "Company Parties"), through the Company or otherwise,
whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through
a claim by or on behalf of the Company against any Company Party, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise, except in
the case of fraud by any of the Company Parties.

10.16. _Specific Performance_.

The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
courts contemplated by Section 10.7, this being in addition to any other
remedy at law or in equity, and the parties to this Agreement hereby waive
any requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree

 



69  that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent
and/or Merger Sub to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity Financing
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter, to
cause Parent to effect the Rollover Investment pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Rollover Contribution Agreements and to cause Parent and/or
Merger Sub to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, in each
case, only if (a) all conditions in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be
satisfied at the Closing (and which are, at the time that the Company
seeks specific performance pursuant to this Section 10.16, capable of being
satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time) or the failure of which
to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub
of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement), (b) the Debt Financing or any Alternative Debt
Financing has been funded or would be funded at the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 if the Equity Financing and
the Rollover Investment had previously or simultaneously been funded on such
date, (c) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (d) the Company
has confirmed in writing to Parent that all conditions set forth in Section
8.3 have been satisfied or that it would be willing to waive any unsatisfied
conditions in Section 8.3 for purposes of consummating the Merger and (e)
such specific performance would result in the consummation of the Merger in
accordance with this Agreement substantially contemporaneously with the
consummation of the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing and the Rollover
Investment.

10.17. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS A PLAINTIFF,
DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), AGAINST ANY PARTY HERETO OR ANY OF THE FINANCING
SOURCES, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF
ANY ISSUE OR ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION OR SUIT (IN CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE), INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT OF, RELATING
TO OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, ISSUE, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION, SUIT, INQUIRY,
PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR BASED UPON THE DEBT
COMMITMENT LETTERS OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF). EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 10.17.

 

10.18. _Company Disclosure Letter_.

The inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter as an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or
would be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
