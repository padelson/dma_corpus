 **WHEREAS** , it is proposed that the acquisition be accomplished by the

 **WHEREAS,** concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

  

# **Article I 
 DEFINITIONS**

  

## ** _1.1. Certain Definitions_** _._ For all purposes of and under
this Agreement, the following capitalized terms shall have the following
respective meanings:

  

" ** _Acquisition Proposal_** " shall mean any offer, proposal or any third
party indication of interest or intent relating to any transaction or series
of related transactions involving: (i) any purchase or acquisition by any
Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 10% interest in the
total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group
beneficially owning 10% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of
the Company, (ii) any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
which the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction
hold less than 90% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction or the parent of any such surviving or resulting
entity, (iii) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of
business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of
business), acquisition or disposition of more than 10% of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than in a transaction
involving not more than 20% of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as may be consented to by Parent, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (iv) any
liquidation or dissolution of the Company (provided, however, that the
transactions between Parent and the Company contemplated by this Agreement
shall not be deemed an Acquisition Proposal), or (v) any combination of the
foregoing.

  

 ** _"Affiliate"_** shall mean, with respect to any Person, any other Person
which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common
control with such Person. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence,
the term "control" (including, with correlative meanings, the terms
"controlling," "controlled by" and "under common control with"), as used with
respect to any Person, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the
power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such
Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or
otherwise.

  

 ** _"Applicable Law"_** shall mean any and all applicable federal, state,
local, municipal, foreign or other law, statute, treaty, constitution,
principle of common law, resolution, ordinance, code, edict, decree,
directive, guidance, order, rule, regulation, ruling or requirement issued,
enacted, adopted, promulgated, implemented or otherwise put into effect by or
under the authority of any Governmental Authority.

     

   



  

 ** _"Business Day"_** shall mean any day, other than a Saturday, Sunday and
any day which is a legal holiday under the laws of the State of Delaware.

  

 ** _"Code"_** shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

  

 ** _"Company Material Adverse Effect"_**  shall mean any change,
circumstance, development, effect, event, fact or occurrence that,
individually, or when taken together with all such other changes,
circumstances, developments, effects, events, facts or occurrences that exist
or have occurred prior to the date of determination of the Company Material
Adverse Effect, has caused, resulted in or had, a material and adverse effect
on the business, financial condition, assets (whether real, personal
or mixed, tangible or intangible), properties, or results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that,
in no event shall any of the following be deemed to constitute or be taken
into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect
has occurred: any change, circumstance, development, effect, event, fact or
occurrence primarily resulting (i) from changes affecting the United States
or world economy generally, which changes do not affect the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner, (ii) from
changes affecting the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate generally which changes do not affect the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner, (iii) from a
change in the Companys stock price or the trading volume in such stock;
provided, however, that this clause (iii) shall not exclude any underlying
effect which may have caused such change in stock price or trading volume,
(iv) from a failure to meet the Companys internal projections or securities
analysts estimates of revenue, earnings or other business or operating
metrics for the Company for any period ending on or after the date of this
Agreement (or for such other period for which estimates of revenues,
earnings or other business or operating metrics are released); provided,
however, that this clause (iv) shall not exclude any underlying effect which
may have caused such failure to meet securities analysts estimates of
revenue, earnings or other business or operating metrics, (v) from changes in
accounting requirements or principles imposed upon the Company and its

" _Merger_ "), the separate corporate existence of the Company shall
thereupon cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation of
the Merger. (Merger Sub, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is
sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").  At
the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time all of the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

## 2.2 ** _. Effective Time of the Merger_** _._ Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Merger Sub
shall cause the Merger to be consummated under Delaware Law by filing a
certificate of merger in customary form and substance (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Delaware Secretary of State_ ") in accordance with the applicable provisions
of Delaware Law, with the time of such filing with the Delaware Secretary
of State, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Parent and the
Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger, being referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Effective Time_."

  

## 2.3. ** _ Closing_** _._ The consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") shall take place at a closing to occur at the offices of Pepper Hamilton
LLP, 600 Fourteenth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005, on a date and at a
time to be agreed upon by Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub and the Company, which
date shall be no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted by this Agreement and Applicable Law) of the
last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver, to the extent permitted
by this Agreement and Applicable Law, of such conditions), or at such other
location, date and time as Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub and the Company shall
mutually agree upon in writing, with the date upon which the Closing shall
actually occur pursuant hereto being referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_."

  

## 2.4. ** _ Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_** _._  The certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the

2.5. _ **Directors and Officers. **_Unless otherwise determined by Parent
prior to the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub holding
office immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation as of and after the Effective Time and
shall continue as such until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.

  

2.6. _ **Effect on Capital Stock; Effect on Options and Warrants.  **_Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
BV Sub, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock
of the Company:

  

### (a) **_Treasury Stock_**. All shares of Company Common Stock that are
held in the Companys treasury shall be cancelled and cease to exist and
no cash, shares of Parent capital stock or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

### (b) **_Subsidiary and Parent-Owned Stock_**. All shares of Company Common
Stock held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
shall be cancelled and cease to exist and no cash, shares of Parent capital
stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All
shares of Company Common Stock held by the Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be cancelled and cease to exist and
no cash, shares of Parent capital stock or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

### (c) **_Conversion of Company Common Stock_**. Subject to the
other provisions of this Article II (including the election and pro-ration
provisions set forth in Section 2.7), each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holder thereof:

  

#### (i) 0.235 shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Per Share Stock
Consideration_ ," and the ratio of one share of Company Common Stock to the
Per Share Stock Consideration being the" _Exchange Ratio_ "); or

  

#### (ii) cash in the amount of $8.00, without interest (the " _Per Share
Cash Consideration_ ").

  

All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall be retired,
shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, and the
holder of a certificate (" _Certificate_ ") that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.8(c): (A) the Per
Share Stock Consideration and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration, as the
case may be, as determined in accordance with Section 2.7, (B) certain
dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.8(d), and (C)
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
Section 2.6(f), in each case without interest (collectively, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for
exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company

     

   

Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date hereof and the Effective
Time the Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock is changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, because of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Cash
Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares.

  

### (d) **_Parent Common Stock_**. The Merger shall not affect any shares of
Parent Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  

### (e) **_Company Options; Company Warrants_**.

  

#### (i) At the Closing, each Company Option then outstanding under any of
the Company Stock Option Plans shall be treated in accordance with the
provisions of this Article II and Section 6.12. At the time of execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the Company shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to Parent written evidence that the Companys Board of
Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has taken
such action pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans and the stock option
agreements pertaining to all outstanding Company Options so as to cause all
Company Options outstanding at the Closing to be cancelled, other than those
to be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 6.12(a) and those that
become Exchanged Options in accordance with Section 6.12(b). With respect to
the Companys 1999 Non-Employee Option Plan, the Company shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the holders of Company
Options outstanding under such plan to exercise such Company Options at or
prior to Closing. Subject to the other provisions of this Article II
(including the election and pro-ration provisions set forth in Section 2.7),
each Exchanged Option shall be converted (on a net basis, taking into account
the exercise price of such Exchanged Option) into the right to receive, at
the election of the holder thereof (A) the Per Share Stock Consideration or
(B) the Per Share Cash Consideration.

  

#### (ii) At the Closing, each Company Warrant then outstanding shall be
treated in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.12(c), except that
Exchanged Warrants shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of this
Article II and Section 6.12. Subject to the other provisions of this Article
II (but excluding the election and pro-ration provisions set forth in Section
2.7), each Exchanged Warrant shall be converted (on a net basis, taking into
account the exercise price of such Exchanged Warrant) into the right to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

  

#### (iii) All Exchanged Options and Exchanged Warrants, when so converted,
shall be retired, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled, and the holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, upon the surrender of such Exchanged
Option or Exchanged Warrant in accordance with Section 2.8(c): (A) the Per
Share Stock Consideration and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration, as the
case may be, as determined in accordance with Section 2.7 (and, in the case
of Exchanged

     

   

#### Warrants, the Per Share Stock Consideration only), (B) certain dividends
and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.8(d), and (C) cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section
2.6(f), in each case without interest. All such consideration paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Exchanged Options or Exchanged Warrants in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Exchanged Option or Exchanged
Warrant.

  

### (f) **_No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_**. No fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu
thereof (i) each holder of shares of Company Common Stock and (ii)
each holder of a Company Option or Company Warrant which becomes an Exchanged
Option or Exchanged Warrant, who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall,
upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s), Company Option or Company
Warrant, as applicable, receive an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, less the amount of any withholding taxes as
contemplated by Section 2.8(f) which are required to be withheld with respect
thereto, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the
average closing price of one share of Parent Common Stock for the ten (10)
most recent trading days that Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the
trading day one day prior to the Effective Time, as reported on the NYSE. As
soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid
to such former holders in lieu of any fractional interests, the Exchange
Agent shall notify Parent, and Parent shall cause BV Sub to deposit with the
Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to make available in
accordance with this Agreement such amounts to such former holders of Company
Common Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants.

  

2.7. ** _ Election and Allocation Procedures._**

  

### (a) **_Cash and Stock Elections_**. Subject to the election and
allocation procedures set forth in this Section 2.7, the limitations imposed
by the Cash Consideration Cap and the Stock Consideration Cap and the
agreements to make Stock Elections set forth in Section 2.7(e), each record
holder (or beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation
and instructions) of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and each holder of a Company Option that has become an
Exchanged Option in accordance with Section 6.12(b) shall be entitled to:

  

#### (i) elect to receive the Merger Consideration (A) in respect of each
such share of Company Common Stock and (B) in respect of each Exchanged
Option (on a net basis, taking into account the exercise price of such
Exchanged Option) entirely in cash (a " _Cash Election_ "),

  

#### (ii) elect to receive the Merger Consideration (A) in respect of each
such share of Company Common Stock and (B) in respect of each Exchanged
Option (on a net basis, taking into account the exercise price of such
Exchanged Option) entirely in shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock
Election_ "), or

  

#### (iii) indicate that such holder has no preference as to the receipt of
cash or shares of Parent Common Stock with respect to such shares of Company
Common

     

   

#### Stock or Exchanged Options (a " _Non-Election_ ;" and any Cash Election,
Stock Election or Non-Election shall be referred to herein generally as an "
_Election_ ");

  

provided, however, that no holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to
make an Election, and, provided further, that the election made by each
holder shall apply to all shares of Company Common Stock and all Exchanged
Options held by each holder (except that a holder of Dissenting Shares who
withdraws or waives such holders dissent pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
shall be entitled to make an Election). All such Elections shall be made on a
form furnished by Parent for that purpose (a " _Form of Election_ ")
reasonably satisfactory to the Company. If more than one Certificate shall be
surrendered in accordance with Section 2.8(c) and/or more than one Company
Option that has become an Exchanged Option in accordance with Section 6.12(b)
for the account of the same holder, the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, to be issued to such holder in exchange for the Certificates
and Exchanged Options that have been surrendered and/or exchanged in
accordance with Section 2.8(c) and Section 6.12(b) shall be computed on the
basis of the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented
by all such Certificates and Exchanged Options surrendered and/or exchanged
for the account of such holder. Holders of record of shares of Company Common
Stock who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or in other representative
capacities may submit multiple Forms of Election, provided that such nominee,
trustee or representative certifies that each such Form of Election covers
all shares of Company Common Stock held for a particular beneficial owner.

  

### (b) **_Pro-ration  Excess Cash Elections_**. Notwithstanding
the Elections made pursuant to Section 2.7(a), the aggregate cash
consideration payable to all holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Options that have become Exchanged Options in accordance with Section
6.12(b) shall not exceed $49,000,000 minus the cash value of Dissenting
Shares (the " _Cash Consideration Cap_ "). For purposes of the definition of
Cash Consideration Cap, the "cash value of Dissenting Shares" shall equal the
Per Share Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that are Dissenting Shares. If the product of (X) the Per Share
Cash Consideration and (Y) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock (including shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding and
shares attributable to Exchanged Options) with respect to which Cash
Elections have been made would exceed the Cash Consideration Cap, then:

  

#### (i) each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Stock
Election shall have been made (including shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding and shares attributable to Exchanged Options) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration;

  

#### (ii) each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Non-
Election shall have been made (or deemed to have been made) (including shares
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding and shares attributable to
Exchanged Options) shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration; and

  

#### (iii) each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Cash
Election shall have been made (including shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding and shares attributable to Exchanged Options) shall be
converted into the

     

   

#### right to receive: (A) the amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (1) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (2) a fraction (the "
_Cash Fraction_ "), the numerator of which shall be the Aggregate Cash
Shares, and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been
made (including shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding and
shares attributable to Exchanged Options), and (B) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Stock
Consideration and (2) a fraction equal to one minus the Cash Fraction.

  

For purposes of this Article II, " _Aggregate Cash Shares_ " means a number
of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the Cash Consideration Cap
_divided by_ the Per Share Cash Consideration.

  

### (c) **_Pro-ration  Excess Parent Stock Elections_**. Notwithstanding the
Elections made pursuant to Section 2.7(a), the aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock payable to all holders of shares of Company Common
Stock (including shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding and
shares attributable to Exchanged Options) shall not exceed that number of
shares equal to 4,300,000 less the shares of Parent Common Stock payable to
the holders of Company Warrants that become Exchanged Warrants pursuant to
Section 2.7(e) and Section 6.12(c) (the " _Stock Consideration Cap_ "). If
the product of (X) the Per Share Stock Consideration and (Y) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which Stock
Elections have been made, including pursuant to the agreements described in
Section 2.7(e) would exceed the Stock Consideration Cap, then:

  

#### (i) each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Cash
Election shall have been made (including shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding and shares attributable to Exchanged Options) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration;

  

#### (ii) each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Non-
Election shall have been made (or deemed to have been made) (including shares
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding and shares attributable to
Exchanged Options) shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration; and

  

#### (iii) each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Stock
Election shall have been made (including shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding and shares attributable to Exchanged Options) shall be
converted into the right to receive: (A) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Stock Consideration
and (2) a fraction (the " _Stock Fraction_ "), the numerator of which shall
be the Aggregate Stock Shares, and the denominator of which shall be the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock (including shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding and shares attributable to
Exchanged Options) with respect to which Stock Elections have been made, and
(B) the amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per
Share Cash Consideration and (2) a fraction equal to one minus the Stock
Fraction.

     

   

For purposes of this Article II, " _Aggregate Stock Shares_ " means a number
of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the Stock Consideration Cap
_divided by_ the Per Share Stock Consideration.

  

### (d) **_No Pro-ration_**. In the event that Sections 2.7(b) and 2.7(c) are
not applicable, then:

  

#### (i) each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Cash
Election shall have been made (including shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding and shares attributable to Exchanged Options) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration;

  

#### (ii) each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Stock
Election shall have been made (including shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding and shares attributable to Exchanged Options) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and

  

#### (iii) each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Non-
Election shall have been made (or deemed to have been made) (including shares
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding and shares attributable to
Exchanged Options) (the " _Non-Electing Shares_ "), if any, shall be
converted into the right to receive a pro rata share of the remaining Per
Share Stock Consideration and Per Share Cash Consideration.

  

### (e) **_Exchanged Warrants; Agreement to Make Stock Election_**.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2.7(a), (b), (c) and (d), any
Company Warrant that becomes an Exchanged Warrant in accordance with Section
6.12(c) shall be exchanged only for the Per Share Stock Consideration (on a
net basis, taking into account the exercise price of such Exchanged Warrant)
and shall not be entitled to make any Election. Further, the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock listed on _Schedule III_ hereto have agreed
and committed to make a Stock Election with respect to all issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by them and the holders of
shares of Company Warrants listed on _Schedule IV_ hereto have agreed and
committed to exchange their Company Warrants in accordance with Section
6.12(c) so that such Company Warrants become Exchanged Warrants. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the Stock Elections made pursuant to this Section
2.7(e) shall be treated as Stock Elections for all purposes of Article II,
including the determination as to whether the Stock Consideration Cap has
been exceeded.

  

### (f) **_Form of Election; Delivery of Certificates_**. A Form of Election
and a letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") shall be
included with or mailed contemporaneously with each copy of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Parent and Company shall each use commercially
reasonable efforts to mail or otherwise make available the Form of Election
and the Letter of Transmittal to all persons who become holders of shares of
Company Common Stock during the period between the record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting and the Effective Time. Elections shall be made
by holders of shares of Company Common Stock and holders of Company Options
that have become Exchanged Options by delivering the Form of Election to the
Exchange Agent (as hereinafter defined). To be effective, a Form of Election
must be properly completed, signed and submitted to and received by the
Exchange Agent by no

     

   

### later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date that is five (5) Business
Days after the Effective Time (the " _Election Deadline_ "), and accompanied
by (i)(A) the Certificates as to which the election is being made or (B) an
appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as set forth in such
Form of Election from a firm that is a member of a registered national
securities exchange or of the NASDAQ or a commercial bank or trust company
having an office or correspondent in the United States, provided such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within three NYSE
trading days after the date of execution of such guarantee of delivery (a "
_Guarantee of Delivery_ "), (ii) an agreement (" _Exchange Agreement_ "),
with respect to Company Options that have become Exchanged Options, and (iii)
a properly completed and signed Letter of Transmittal.

  

### (g) **_Failure to Deliver; Defects_**. Failure to deliver Certificates
covered by any Guarantee of Delivery within three (3) NYSE trading days after
the date of execution of such Guarantee of Delivery shall be deemed to
invalidate any otherwise properly made Cash Election or Stock Election.
Parent will have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to
the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have been
properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard
immaterial defects in Forms of Election. The good faith decision of Parent
(or the Exchange Agent) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding.
Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify
any person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange
Agent. A Form of Election with respect to Dissenting Shares shall not be
valid. The Exchange Agent shall also make all computations contemplated by
this Section 2.7 and all such computations shall be conclusive and binding on
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Exchanged Options and
Exchanged Warrants in the absence of manifest error. Any Form of Election may
be changed or revoked prior to the Election Deadline. In the event a Form of
Election is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Exchange Agent to, cause the Certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock covered by such Form of Election to be promptly returned
without charge to the Person submitting the Form of Election upon written
request to that effect from such Person.

  

### (h) **_Non-Elections; Dissenting Shares_**. Subject to the immediately
succeeding sentence, for the purposes hereof, a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock who does not submit a Form of Election that is received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline (including a holder who submits
and then revokes his, her or its Form of Election and does not resubmit a
Form of Election that is timely received by the Exchange Agent and
otherwise complies with the terms and conditions hereof), or who submits a
Form of Election without the other documents required by this Section 2.7,
shall be deemed to have made a Non-Election. Holders of Dissenting Shares
shall not be entitled to make an Election other than a holder of Dissenting
Shares who withdraws or waives such holders dissent pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL and shall not be deemed to have made a Non-Election; the rights
of such holders of Dissenting Shares shall be determined in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and Section 2.9. If any Form of Election is defective
in any manner such that the Exchange Agent cannot reasonably determine the
election preference of the stockholder submitting such Form of Election, the
purported Cash Election or Stock Election set forth therein shall be deemed
to be of no force and effect and the stockholder making such purported Cash
Election or Stock Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to have made
a Non-Election.

     

   

2.8. ** _ Exchange of Certificates._**

  

### (a) **_Exchange Agent_**. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, Parent shall appoint Computershare Investor Services LLC, or
such other bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to
act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of (i)
receiving Forms of Election and determining, in accordance with this Article
II, the form of Merger Consideration to be received by each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock, Exchanged Options and Exchanged Warrants and (ii)
exchanging the applicable Merger Consideration for shares of Company Common
Stock, Exchanged Options and Exchanged Warrants.

  

### (b) **_Parent to Cause Deposit of Merger Consideration_**. Prior to or on
the Closing Date, Parent shall cause BV Sub to deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant hereto. The Merger Consideration
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_." For the purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume that
there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock; provided,
however, that at the time Parent determines the number of fractional shares
to be paid in cash, it will promptly cause BV Sub to deposit with the
Exchange Agent such additional amount necessary to make such payments. The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash contemplated to be issued out of the Exchange
Fund on the terms set forth herein. The Exchange Fund may not be used for any
other purpose.

  

### (c) **_Exchange Procedures_**. Upon surrender of a Certificate
or Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with a Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, an Exchange Agreement (if required) and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate, holder of a Company Option that has become an Exchanged
Option or holder of a Company Warrant that has become an Exchanged Warrant,
as applicable, subject to Section 2.8(e), shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. The shares of Parent Common Stock constituting part
of such Merger Consideration (if any), at Parents option, shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by
a holder or is otherwise required under Applicable Law. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time,
for all corporate purposes, to evidence the ownership of the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
so converted.

  

### (d) **_Dividends and Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged
Shares_**. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.6(f), shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificates not surrendered until such Certificates are
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section
2.8. Subject to Applicable Law, following such surrender or transfer, there
shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the securities
of Parent have been registered, (i) at the time of such surrender or
transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to
which such

     

   

### Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(f), and the amount of all
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such
securities and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior
to surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or
transfer payable with respect to such securities.

  

### (e) **_Payments to Persons Other than a Registered Holder_**. If any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered or, in
the case of a Company Option that has become an Exchanged Option or a
Company Warrant that has become an Exchanged Warrant, to a Person other than
the Person named as the holder thereof, it shall be a condition to such
payment that (i) in the case of a holder of Company Common Stock, (A) either
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent (or the Exchange Agent or any other
agent designated by Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid
or are otherwise not payable or (ii) in the case of an Exchanged Option or
Exchanged Warrant, (A) the named holder of such Exchanged Option or Exchanged
Warrant shall provide written instructions to the Exchange Agent authorizing
such payment to such Person requesting such payment and (B) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the named
holder or establish to the satisfaction of Parent (or the Exchange Agent or
any other agent designated by Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have
been paid or are otherwise not payable.

  

### (f) **_Withholding_**. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, BV Sub and the
Surviving Corporation shall deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Exchanged
Options or Exchanged Warrants such amounts as may be required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under United States federal or state, local or foreign
law. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld pursuant to
this Section 2.8(f), such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

  

### (g) **_No Liability_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, BV Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock, Company Common Stock, Exchanged
Options or Exchanged Warrants for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Applicable Laws.

  

### (h) **_Investment of Exchange Fund_**. The Exchange Agent shall invest
the cash included in the Exchange Fund in direct obligations of the U.S.
Treasury or otherwise with the consent of Parent, on a daily basis; provided,
however, that no such investment or loss thereon

     

   

### shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Common Stock,
Exchanged Options or Exchanged Warrants pursuant to this Article II. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to
holders of Company Common Stock, Exchanged Options or Exchanged Warrants
pursuant to this Article II shall promptly be paid to Parent upon Parents
request. If for any reason (including losses) the amount of cash in the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the
payment obligations of Parent to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent
hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to be deposited cash into
the Exchange Fund an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash
required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

  

### (i) **_Termination of Exchange Fund_**. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall,
at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise according to the instruction of the Surviving
Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates who have not surrendered
such Certificates in compliance with this Section 2.8 shall after such
delivery to Surviving Corporation look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration (and as a
general creditor for the cash constituting the Merger Consideration, which
cash shall not accrue interest) pursuant to Section 2.7, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6(f) and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.8(d) with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Company Common Stock after twenty-four (24) months
following the Effective Time shall become, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

2.9. _ **Dissenting Shares. **_Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of the Merger and who has delivered a written demand for
appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II, unless and until
such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such
holders right to appraisal under applicable Delaware Law. A Dissenting
Stockholder may receive payment of the fair value of the shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by such Dissenting Stockholder (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") in
accordance with the provisions of applicable Delaware Law, provided that such
Dissenting Stockholder complies with Section 262 of the DGCL. At the
Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist
and shall represent only the right to receive the fair value thereof in
accordance with applicable Delaware Law. Any Dissenting Shares as to which
the holder later waives or withdraws a demand for appraisal shall be entitled
to make an Election, subject to pro-ration to the same extent as if such
holder surrendered such formerly Dissenting Shares promptly following the
Effective Time subject to a valid Election. The Company shall provide Parent
(a) prompt written notice of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals
of demands for appraisal and any other instruments served under applicable
Delaware Law, and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations, proceedings or settlements with respect to demands
for appraisal under applicable Delaware Law. The Company shall not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to

     

   

any demands for appraisal and shall not, except with Parents prior written
consent, settle or offer to settle any such demands.

  

2.10. _ **Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Share Certificates. **_In the event that
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of a satisfactory affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock, cash for
fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.6(f) and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.8(d); provided,
however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

2.11. _ **Tax Consequences. **_It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Merger constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

  

2.12. _ **Further Action. **_At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of Parent, BV Sub and the Surviving Corporation will be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company
and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of Company and Merger Sub, any other
actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by
the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  

2.13. _ **Restriction on Further Purchases of Shares. **_From the date of
this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement, except pursuant to or as contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) (i)
acquire or make any proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, any
beneficial interest in shares of Company Common Stock or any options,
warrants or other securities exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock,
(ii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to
advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any
securities of the Company, or (iii) form, join or participate in a "group"
(within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company; provided,
however, that the restrictions imposed by this Section 2.13 shall not apply

additional or subsequent events) result in any payment, acceleration, vesting

Company Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated, at any time determined by
the Company in its sole discretion.

provisions of such policies. The Company and its Subsidiaries have reported

statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated by
reference) required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2004. All
such required registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents (including those that Parent may file
subsequent to the date hereof) are referred to herein as the " _Parent SEC
Reports_." As of their respective dates, the Parent SEC Reports (i) were
prepared in accordance and complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent
SEC Reports and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement then on the
date of such amended or superceding filing) contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of
Parents Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC. Parent has previously furnished to the Company a
complete and correct copy of any amendments or

     

   

## modifications, which have not yet been filed with the SEC but which are
required to be filed, to agreements, documents or other instruments which
previously had been filed by Parent with the SEC pursuant to the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act. Parent has responded to all comment letters of the
staff of the SEC relating to Parent SEC Reports, and the SEC has not
advised Parent that any final responses are inadequate, insufficient or
otherwise non-responsive. Parent has made available to the Company true,
correct and complete copies of all correspondence between the SEC, on the one
hand, and Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the other, including all SEC
comment letters and responses to such comment letters by or on behalf of
Parent. To Parents Knowledge, none of Parents SEC Reports is the subject of
ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comment. Parent and, to the Parents
Knowledge, each of its officers and directors are in compliance with, and
have complied, in each case in all material respects with (i) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations
promulgated under or pursuant to such act and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of NYSE. Each required form,
report and document containing financial statements that has been filed with
or submitted to the SEC by Parent was accompanied by the certifications
required to be filed or submitted by Parents chief executive officer and/or
chief financial officer, as required, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and,
at the time of filing or submission of each such certification, such
certification was true and accurate and complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Neither Parent nor, to Parents Knowledge, any of its executive officers has
received notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning
the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing such certifications.

  

## 4.5. **_Financial Statements_. **(a) **_Financial Statements_**. The
consolidated financial statements of Parent included in Parent SEC Reports
(the " _Parent Financials_ ") comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, or in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K or any successor
form under the Exchange Act) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and fairly
present, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial position of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended.
Parent does not intend to correct or restate, nor is there any basis for any
correction or restatement of, any aspect of the Parent Financials. The books
and records of Parent and Parents Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with applicable legal and
accounting requirements, and the Parent Financials are consistent with such
books and records. Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against
on Parents most recent balance sheet (or in the notes thereto) included in
the Parent SEC Reports, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any
liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a nature required
to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet or in the related notes to a
consolidated financial statement prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for
liabilities incurred since the date of Parents most recent balance sheet in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices. Parent has
not had any unresolved dispute with any of its auditors regarding accounting
matters or policies during any of its past three full years or during the
current fiscal year-to-date. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-
balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract relating to any transaction
or

     

   

## relationship between or among Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose Person, on the other hand, or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K).

  

### (b) **_Internal Controls_**. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
has established and maintains, adheres to and enforces a system of
internal controls which are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP (including the Parent
Financials), including policies and procedures that (i) require the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that material information
relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries is promptly made known to the
officers responsible for establishing and maintaining the system of internal
controls, (iii) provide assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of Parent and its Subsidiaries are being made
only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the
Board of Directors of Parent, (iv) provide reasonable assurance that
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization, (v) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and (vi) provide reasonable assurance
that any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to materially and
adversely affect the ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
Parents management or other Employees who have a role in the preparation of
financial statements or the internal controls utilized by Parent and its
Subsidiaries, are adequately and promptly disclosed to Parents independent
auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board of Directors.  Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including, to Parents Knowledge, any
Employee thereof) nor Parents independent auditors has identified or been
made aware of (A) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the
system of internal controls utilized by Parent and its Subsidiaries (other
than a significant deficiency or material weakness that has been disclosed to
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Parent, and, in the case of
a material weakness, that has been disclosed as required in the Parent SEC
Reports), (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves Parents
management or other Employees who have a role in the preparation of financial
statements or the internal controls utilized by Parent and its Subsidiaries
or (C) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing (other than
claims or allegations that have been duly investigated and found not to
involve any of the foregoing).

  

### (c) **_Accounting and Auditing Practices_**. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor, to Parents Knowledge, any director, officer, employee,
auditor, accountant, consultant or representative of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any substantive complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices. No current or former attorney
representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has reported evidence of
a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Board of

     

   

### Directors of the Company or any committee thereof or to any director or
executive officer of the Company.

  

### (d) **_Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act_**. To Parents Knowledge,
no employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has provided or is providing
information to any law enforcement agency regarding the commission or
possible commission of any crime or the violation or possible violation of
any applicable legal requirements of the type described in Section 806 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any director,
officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor or agent of Parent or any such
Subsidiary has discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any
other manner discriminated against an employee of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful
act of such employee described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

## 4.6. **_Absence of Changes._** Other than as disclosed in Section 4.6 of
the Parent Disclosure Letter or in the Parent Financials, from January 1,
2006 through the date of this Agreement, Parent has conducted its business in

notes or accounts receivable other than in the ordinary course of business

contemplated hereby, provided, however, that with respect to any such filing,
presentation or submission, each of Parent and the Company need not supply
the other (or its counsel) with copies (or in the case of oral presentations,

Governmental Authority applicable to such party requires such party or its
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information, and (iv) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated
by a private party, and permit the other party to review any communication

to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or other applicable Governmental
Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences if permitted under Antitrust
Laws.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as may be agreed in
connection with any joint defense agreement executed between counsel for
Parent and counsel for the Company, Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub and the
Company will not be required to share with each other any documents covered

instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other
applicable Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law or
otherwise brought under any Antitrust Law that would otherwise prohibit or
materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections
or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company shall not take or agree to take any Action of
Divestiture that would reasonably be likely to adversely and materially
impact Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the benefits Parent expects to derive from
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the
prior written consent of Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Action
of Divestiture_ " shall mean (i) any license, sale or other disposition or

acquire, hold or exercise all material rights of ownership of
their respective businesses and, in the case of Parent, the businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or (iii) the imposition of any material
impediment on Parent, its Subsidiaries or affiliates or the Company or its
Subsidiaries under any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree,

the Company, shall use its best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as

## 6.12. **_Options and Warrants._**

  

### (a) **_Assumption of Certain Options_**. At the Effective Time,
each then-outstanding Company Option that is (i) not yet vested and
exercisable by its terms, and regardless of the exercise price thereof, (ii)
vested, with a per share exercise price that is greater than the market price
per share of the Companys Common Stock on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date, or (iii) issued under the Companys 1999 Non-Employee Option
Plan, is vested and currently exercisable (including Company Options which
vest in connection with the Merger under applicable "change of control"
provisions of the Company Stock Option Plans or other agreements identified
in Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter) and which has a per share
exercise price that is less than or equal to the market price per share of
the Companys

     

   

### Common Stock on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and which
has not been exercised prior to the Effective Date (each, an " _Assumed
Option_ ") will be assumed by the Parent. Each Assumed Option will continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the
applicable Company Option (including any applicable stock option agreement or
other document evidencing such Company Option) immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions
and including qualification as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of
the Code if the Assumed Company Option so qualified), except that (i) each
such Assumed Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares underlying such
Assumed Option and (B) 0.235 **** and (ii) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed
Option will be equal to the quotient of (X) the exercise price of such
Assumed Option and (Y) 0.235. With respect to each Assumed Option, the same
vesting schedule as was applicable to the Assumed Option prior to the
Effective Time will be applicable to the Assumed Option following the
Effective Time.  As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent will use all
reasonable efforts to issue to each Person who holds an Assumed Option a
document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company Option by Parent
and, as a condition to such assumption, each former holder of a Company
Option so assumed by Parent shall acknowledge the receipt of the same in
exchange for such holders Company Option. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall take all action necessary to permit Parent to assume the
Company Options identified in this Section 6.12, including the adoption of
amendments to the Company Stock Option Plans and/or the stock option
agreements pertaining to such outstanding Company Options intended to become
Assumed Options and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
amendments or consents of, or acknowledgments and releases from the
holders of such Company Options, if so requested by Parent, which such
amendments, consents, acknowledgments or releases shall be in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.

  

### (b) **_Company Options Not Assumed_**.

  

#### (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.12(b), all
outstanding Company Options which are vested and currently exercisable
(including Company Options which shall vest in connection with the Merger
under applicable "change of control" provisions of the Company Stock Option
Plans or other agreements identified in Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure
Letter) and which have a per share exercise price that is less than or equal
to the market price per share of the Companys Common Stock on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be cancelled, with such
cancellation effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the
Company shall promptly following the date of this Agreement (i) inform all
affected holders of Company Options of the requirement to cause all of such
Company Options to be cancelled and (ii) take all action necessary to cause
such cancellation, including the adoption of amendments to the Company Stock
Option Plans and/or the stock option agreements pertaining to all outstanding
Company Options that are to be cancelled pursuant to this Section 6.12, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the amendments or
consents of, or acknowledgments and releases from the holders of such Company
Options, if so requested by Parent, which such amendments, consents,
acknowledgments or releases shall be in form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent. With respect to the Companys 1999 Non-Employee Option Plan, the
Companys obligation shall be limited to using all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the holders of Company Options outstanding under such plan
to exercise such Company

   

70   

 

  

#### Options at or prior to Closing. The Company shall, promptly following
the date of this Agreement, notify the holders of Company Options which may
be affected by this Section 6.12(b) of the terms hereof.

  

#### (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1 and Section
6.12(b)(i), following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing
Date, the Company, through action of its Board of Directors or Compensation
Committee, may provide that the Company Options identified above in Section
6.12(b)(i) may, at the election of the holder of such Company Options and in
lieu of exercising such Company Options for shares of Company Common Stock,
elect to exchange such Company Options for the Merger Consideration by making
a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Non-Election and agreeing that such
Election shall be subject to the provisions of Article II applicable to
holders of Company Common Stock generally. Such Company Options as to which
the holders thereof choose to make an Election are referred to herein as "
_Exchanged Options_."

  

### (c) **_Company Warrants._**  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
5.1, the Company, shall provide that all outstanding Company Warrants may, at
the election of the holder of such Company Warrants and in lieu of exercising
such Company Warrants for shares of Company Common Stock or having such
Company Warrants continue in effect following consummation of the Merger,
elect to exchange such Company Warrants for the Per Share Stock Consideration
(on a net basis, taking into account the exercise price of such Company
Warrants). Such Company Warrants as to which the holders thereof choose to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration are referred to herein as "
_Exchanged Warrants_." The Company shall promptly following the date of this
Agreement obtain and deliver to Parent written agreements, in form agreed to
by Parent, from each holder of outstanding Company Warrants identified on
_Schedule II_ , which agreements shall provide that such holder will (i)
exercise such Company Warrants in full at or prior to Closing, (ii) agree to
have such Company Warrants become Exchanged Warrants pursuant to this Section
6.12(c), or (iii) be subject to a new warrant or warrants in replacement of
such Company Warrants, in form agreed to by Parent and such holders;
provided, however, that holders of all Company Warrants identified on
_Schedule IV_ shall agree to have such Company Warrants become Exchanged
Warrants pursuant to this Section 6.12(c).

  

## 6.13. **_Form S-8. _**Parent agrees to file a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) promptly after the
Effective Time with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
with respect to any Company Options assumed by Parent in connection with the
Merger, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as the Company Options assumed by Parent in accordance
with this Agreement remain outstanding.

  

## 6.14. **_Option Information. _**Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall provide to Parent with an update of the information required to be
provided by the Company in accordance with Section 3.2(b) with respect to
Company Options and Company Warrants, with such information to be as of the
date immediately preceding the Effective Time.

### (a) **_Indemnity_**. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, honor and
fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
under any and all indemnification agreements (true and correct copies of
which have been provided to Parent) in effect as of the date hereof between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or
former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), with respect to any matter
arising out of, relating to, or in connection with any acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time. In
addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent
shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to), to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification and exculpation in favor of such Indemnified Parties, with
respect to any matter arising out of, relating to, or in connection with any
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the
Effective Time, that are at least as favorable as the indemnification and
exculpation provisions contained in the Company Charter Documents and the
Subsidiaries Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof.
Further, during such six-year period, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
claim, with respect to any matter arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred
prior to the Effective Time (in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party under the indemnification provisions in the Company Charter
Documents or his or her indemnification agreement), brought against any
Indemnified Party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents and Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall (and shall cause its or their Subsidiaries to), cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; provided, however, that an unconditional release
or consent from such Indemnified Party will not be required for the
settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation in any pending or threatened action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim in connection with liability of
such Indemnified Party (i) for any breach of a directors duty of loyalty to
the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith
or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii)
under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) any transaction from which a director
derived an improper personal benefit.

  

### (b) **_Insurance_**. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to cause to be maintained
directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons who are
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
as of the date hereof for events occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
in an amount and scope at least as favorable as those in the
current directors and officers insurance policy of the Company; provided,
however, that in no event will Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the current annual
insurance premium. In the event that the annual premium would exceed 250% of
the current annual insurance premium the Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to cause to be maintained, for such amount the maximum amount of
coverage as is available.  Notwithstanding

     

   

### the foregoing, Parent may satisfy its and the Surviving Corporations
obligations under this Section 6.15(b) by purchasing a "tail" policy, or
prior to the Effective Time or consenting to the purchase of a "tail" policy
by the Company (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) (x) under the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policy or otherwise from Parents insurance carrier on the date
hereof or (y) from an insurance carrier with a financial rating of AX or
better as rated by A.M. Best , which, in either case has an effective term of
six (6) years from the Effective Time, covers those persons who are currently
covered by the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect
as of the date hereof for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time, and is written in an amount and scope at least as favorable
as those in the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect
as of the date hereof.

  

### (c) **_Third Party Beneficiaries_**. This Section 6.15 is intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and
their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and
the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns.

  

### (d) **_Tolling_**. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before,
at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
Section 6.15 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

### (e) **_Continuing Obligation_**. In the event that the Surviving
Corporation or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets
to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section
6.15.

  

## 6.16. **_Affiliates. _**The Company shall identify in a letter to Parent

of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

  

9.4. _ **Counterparts. **_This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  

9.5. _ **Attorneys  Fees. **_ If any action at law or equity, including
an action for declaratory relief, is brought to enforce or interpret any
provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys fees and expenses from the other party, which

the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Voting Agreements and other
Exhibits and Schedules hereto constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior

accordance with its terms and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.  This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided, following
the Effective Time, in Section 6.15.

  

9.7. _ **Severability. **_In the event that any provision of this Agreement
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties
further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this

9.11. _ **Specific Performance. **_The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions pursuant thereto as are
necessary on its part to the consummation of the Merger, will cause
irreparable injury to the other parties. It is accordingly agreed that the

exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any

addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity.

 ** _Exhibit A-1_**

  

 **STOCKHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT**

  

This STOCKHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of November 6, 2006 by and among NAVTEQ Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Parent_ "), NAVTEQ Holdings B.V., a corporation organized
under the laws of The Netherlands (" _BV Sub_ "), NAVTEQ Holdings Delaware,
Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger
Sub_ "), Traffic.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and
the person whose name appears on the signature page hereto as a Stockholder
(the " _Stockholder_ ") of the Company. Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein, and defined in the Merger Agreement (as
defined below), shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the
Merger Agreement.

  

 **RECITALS**

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company,
Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger of even date herewith (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which
the parties thereto have agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, to the Merger;

  

WHEREAS, the Stockholder is the beneficial owner of such number of shares of
common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Common
Stock_ "), set forth on the signature page hereto, and options, warrants or
other rights to acquire such number of shares of Company Common Stock as set
forth on the signature page hereto; and

  

WHEREAS, as a material inducement and a condition to Parent, BV Sub and
Merger Sub entering into the Merger Agreement, Parent has requested that the
Stockholder agree, and the Stockholder has agreed (in the Stockholders
capacity as such), for the benefit of Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub, to enter
into this Agreement to facilitate the consummation of the Merger;

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub and the Stockholder hereby agree as
follows:

  

1. **_Certain Definitions_**. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

 **"** _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earlier to occur of (a) such date
and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been validly terminated pursuant
to its terms, (b) the Effective Time, or (c) the occurrence of a Material
Adverse Amendment.

  

" _Material Adverse Amendment_ " means an amendment to the Merger Agreement
that (i) materially and adversely affects the Stockholder and (ii) is
approved by the Companys Board of

     

   

Directors notwithstanding the fact that in such vote the Stockholders
nominee on the Companys Board of Directors voted against such amendment.

  

" _Shares_ " means (a) all equity securities of the Company (including all
shares of Company Common Stock, and all options, warrants and other rights to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock) beneficially owned by the Stockholder
as of the date of this Agreement and (b) all additional equity securities of
the Company (including all additional options, warrants and other rights to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock) of which Stockholder acquires
beneficial ownership during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement until the Expiration Date.

  

" _Voting Period_ " means the period commencing on the date of this Agreement
and continuing until the Expiration Date.

  

2. **_Representations and Warranties of Stockholder_**.  The Stockholder represents and warrants to Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub as follows:

  

(a) The Stockholder is the beneficial owner (as such term is defined in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act, provided, however, that for the purposes of
this Agreement, such term shall include any Shares that may be acquired more
than sixty (60) days from the date hereof) of all of the Shares. The
Stockholder has sole voting power and the sole power of disposition with
respect to all of the Shares, with no limitations, qualifications or
restrictions on such rights (subject to applicable federal securities laws
and the terms of this Agreement). Such Shares constitute all of the Shares
beneficially owned by the Stockholder. The Shares are held by the Stockholder,
or by a nominee or custodian for the benefit of the Stockholder, free and
clear of all mortgages, claims, charges, liens, security interests, pledges,
options, proxies, voting trusts or agreements (" _Encumbrances_ "), except
for any such Encumbrances arising hereunder and Encumbrances applicable to
all securityholders alike, such as the restrictions upon resale imposed by
the Securities Act.

  

(b) The Stockholder has the legal capacity, power and authority, as
applicable, to enter into and perform all of the Stockholders obligations
under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Stockholder and constitutes (assuming due execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub) a valid and
binding agreement of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by
general equitable principles. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Stockholder will not violate any agreement or court order to
which the Stockholder is a party or is subject, including,
without limitation, any voting agreement or voting trust, except for any of
the foregoing as would not impair the Stockholders ability to perform
its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

  

(c) Except for any applicable filings under the Exchange Act, no filing with,
and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Authority or any other Person is

     

   

required to be made or obtained by the Stockholder for the execution of this
Agreement by the Stockholder, compliance by the Stockholder with the
provisions hereof or performance of the Stockholders obligations hereunder.

  

(d) If the Stockholder is married and the Shares constitute community
property, this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by,
and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of, the Stockholders spouse,
enforceable against such person in accordance with its terms.

  

(e) The Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering
into, and causing BV Sub and Merger Sub to enter into, the Merger Agreement
in reliance upon the Stockholders concurrent execution and delivery of this
Agreement, including Parents reliance on the Stockholders representations
and warranties contained herein.

  

3. **_Representations and Warranties of the Company_**. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub as follows:

  

(a) The Company has the corporate power and authority to enter into and
perform all of its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general equitable principles.

  

(b) Except for filings under the Exchange Act, no filing with, and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is
necessary for the execution of this Agreement by the Company, compliance by
the Company with the provisions hereof or performance of its obligations
hereunder.

  

4. **_Representations and Warranties of Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub_**. Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Stockholder as follows:

  

(a) Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub have the corporate power and authority to
enter into and perform all of their respective obligations under this
Agreement.  This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of each of them, enforceable against them in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general
equitable principles.

  

(b) Except for filings under the Exchange Act, no filing with, and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is
necessary for the execution of this Agreement by Parent, BV Sub or Merger
Sub, compliance by Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub with the provisions hereof
or performance of their obligations hereunder.

     

   

5. **_Voting Agreement_**.

  

(a) The Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that,
during the Voting Period, the Stockholder shall (i) appear (in person or by
proxy) at any meeting (whether annual or special and whether or not an
adjourned or postponed meeting) of the holders of Company Common Stock,
properly called, or otherwise cause the Shares then beneficially owned by the
Stockholder to be counted as present thereat for purposes of establishing a
quorum, and (ii) vote or provide a written consent with respect to all Shares
(or will cause all Shares to be voted, or cause a written consent to be
provided with respect to all Shares) (A) in favor of adoption and approval of
the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger, not including any Material
Adverse Amendment, (B) against any action, proposal, transaction or agreement
that would result, or could reasonably be expected to result, in any material
respect in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, and
(C) against any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with,
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including any Acquisition Proposal. In all other matters,
the Shares shall be voted by and in the manner determined by the Stockholder.

  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Stockholder
is a director or officer of the Company, it is expressly understood and
agreed that this Agreement shall not limit or restrict any actions taken by
the Stockholder in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the
Company either (i) pursuant to Applicable Law or (ii) in exercising the
Companys rights or fulfilling the Companys obligations under the Merger
Agreement (to the extent permitted or required by the Merger Agreement).

  

6. **_Grant of Irrevocable Proxy_**. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Stockholder has delivered to Parent a proxy in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Proxy_ ") with respect to the Shares. Such Proxy shall be irrevocable to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.

  

7. **_No Solicitation_**. The Stockholder shall, and shall cause its affiliates that it controls and its and its control affiliates respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, financial and other advisors or other representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, or induce the making, submission or announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent, BV Sub or Merger Sub) any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent, BV Sub or Merger Sub), or take any other action intended to assist or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than to notify such Person as to the existence of this provision), (iv) approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other agreement, contract or arrangement contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Transaction, or (vi) terminate, amend or waive any rights under any "standstill" or other similar 

     

   

agreement between the Stockholder and any Person (other than Parent).  The
Stockholder shall immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent
and its affiliates and representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Stockholder acknowledges and hereby agrees that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 7 by the Stockholder or any
representatives of the Stockholder shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 7 by the Stockholder.  The Stockholder shall not enter into any
letter of intent or similar document or any agreement contemplating or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal unless and until this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to its terms.

  

8. ** _No Transfers During Voting Period._** The Stockholder agrees that during the Voting Period, except as expressly contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, such Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly,  (i) sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of (including by merger, testamentary disposition, interspousal disposition pursuant to spousal domestic relations proceedings or otherwise, or otherwise by operation of law) (collectively, " _Transfer_ ") any of the Shares, or enter into any contract, option or other agreement to Transfer any of the Shares, or otherwise cause or permit the Transfer of any Shares, (ii) grant any proxies or powers of attorney or enter into any voting trust or other similar agreements or arrangements with respect to any Shares; (iii) request that the Company register the Transfer of any certificate or uncertificated interest representing any of the Shares, or (iv) take any action that would have the effect of preventing, impeding, interfering with or adversely affecting its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Stockholder hereby agrees that, in order to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to herein, the Company may issue appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent in respect of the Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Stockholder may surrender shares in connection with "cashless" or net exercise provisions of Company Options or Warrants to the extent necessary to effect exercises thereof (including the payment of any taxes required to be withheld and paid with respect to such exercises).

  

9 _. **Acquisition of Additional Shares**_.

  

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the Expiration Date, the Stockholder
shall promptly notify Parent of the number of any additional shares of
Company Common Stock and the number and type of any other voting securities
of the Company acquired by the Stockholder, if any, after the date hereof.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall obligate the Stockholder to exercise any option, warrant or
other right to acquire Shares.

  

(b) In the event of a stock dividend or distribution, or any change in the
Shares by reason of any stock dividend or distribution, split-up,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the term
"Shares" shall be deemed to refer to and include the Shares as well as all
such stock dividends and distributions and any securities into which or for
which any or all of the Shares may be changed or exchanged or which are
received in such transaction.

     

   

10\. **_No Ownership Interest_**. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence
of ownership of or with respect to any Shares.  Except as provided in this
Agreement, all rights, ownership and economic benefits relating to the Shares
shall remain vested in and belong to the Stockholder.

  

11. **_Disclosure_**.  The Stockholder hereby agrees to permit Parent to publish and disclose in the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including all documents and schedules filed with the SEC), and in any press release or other disclosure document which Parent reasonably determines to be necessary or desirable to comply with applicable law or the rules and regulations of The New York Stock Exchange in connection with the Merger and any transactions related thereto, the Stockholders identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of the Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement, provided that any public announcement or disclosure is made in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and the requirements of Applicable Law, subject to Parent using its reasonable best efforts to consult with the Stockholder and giving the Stockholder the right to review and comment upon any such disclosure. In addition, the Stockholder will cooperate with Parent in connection with the filing of any Schedule 13D or amendment thereto that Parent reasonably determines is required under the Exchange Act in connection with this Agreement.

  

12. **_Consent and Waiver_. **The Stockholder hereby gives any consents or waivers that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under the terms of any agreement or instrument to which the Stockholder is a party. Without limiting the generality of or effect of the foregoing, the Stockholder hereby waives any and all rights to contest or object to the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the actions of the Board of Directors of the Company in approving and recommending the Merger, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or to seek damages or other legal or equitable relief in connection therewith.  From and after the Effective Time, the Stockholders right to receive its portion of the Merger Consideration on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement shall constitute the Stockholders sole and exclusive right against the Company and/or Parent or Merger Sub in respect of the Stockholders status as a stockholder of the Company.

  

13. **_Confidentiality_. **The Stockholder shall hold any information regarding this Agreement and the Merger in strict confidence and shall not divulge any such information to any third person (except to affiliates and to its limited partners, investment bankers, attorneys, financial and other advisors) until the Parent has publicly disclosed the Merger, except for disclosures which the Stockholders legal counsel advises are necessary in order to fulfill such Stockholders obligations imposed by law, in which event the Stockholder shall give prior notice of such disclosure to Parent as promptly as practicable.  Subject to the exception in the immediately preceding sentence, neither the Stockholder, nor any of its affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger, the Merger Agreement or other transactions contemplated thereby.

  

14. **_Termination_**. This Agreement shall automatically terminate (without requirement of further action or notice) on the Expiration Date.

agreement of the parties.

  

(b) Any failure of the Stockholder, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition herein may be waived by Parent (with respect to any failure by the
Stockholder) or the Stockholder (with respect to any failure by Parent or
Merger Sub), respectively, only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.  Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf
of any party hereto, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner
consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in
this Section 15(b).

  

(c) All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and

(d) Neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder
shall be assigned by either of the parties hereto without the prior written
consent of the other party. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and its and their successors and
permitted assigns and shall be binding upon the Stockholder and the

     

   

Stockholders heirs, successors and assigns by will or by the laws of
descent. This Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or remedies
hereunder upon any other person except the parties hereto.

  

(e) This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflicts of law
provisions.

  

(f) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT

JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF
ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR
OTHERWISE.

  

(g) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction
and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery or any court of the United States
located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of
Chancery or, if under Applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter
is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States located in
the State of Delaware and (iv) consents to service being made through the
notice procedures set forth in Section 15(c). Each party hereby agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
to the respective addresses set forth herein for the delivery of notices
generally shall be effective service of process for any legal proceeding in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(h) This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

  

(i) In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement
should be finally determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect against a party hereto, it shall be adjusted if possible to effect
the intent of the parties. In any event, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby, and such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall only apply as to such party in the specific
jurisdiction where such final determination shall have been made.

  

(j) The section headings contained in this Agreement are solely for the
purpose of reference and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The word "including" shall be deemed to
mean "including without limitation."

     

   

(k) This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are
no representations, promises, warranties, covenants, or undertakings, other
than those expressly set forth or referred to herein and therein.

  

(l) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to
perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take
all actions as are necessary on its part in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement to facilitate the Merger, will cause irreparable
injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available, will not
be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the
issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction
to compel performance of such partys obligations and to the granting by any
court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder.

  

(m) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

  

(n) All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses.

  

(o) Each party to this Agreement has been represented by counsel during the
preparation and execution of this Agreement, and therefore waives any rule of
construction that would construe ambiguities against the party drafting the
agreement.

  

(p) From time to time, at the other partys request and without further
consideration, each party hereto shall execute and deliver such additional
documents and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 ** _EXHIBIT A_**

  

 **IRREVOCABLE PROXY**

  

The undersigned Stockholder (the " _Stockholder_ ") of Traffic.com, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), hereby irrevocably (to the fullest
extent permitted by law) appoints each of Judson D. Green, David Mullen and
Lawrence M. Kaplan of NAVTEQ Corporation, as the sole and exclusive attorneys
and proxies of the undersigned, with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, to vote and exercise all voting and related rights (to the
full extent that the undersigned is entitled to do so) with respect to all of
the shares of capital stock of the Company that now are or hereafter may be
beneficially owned by the undersigned, and any and all other shares or
securities of the Company issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after
the date hereof (collectively, the " _Shares_ "), in accordance with the
terms of this Proxy. The Shares beneficially owned by the Stockholder as of
the date of this Proxy are listed on the signature page of this Proxy, along
with the number(s) of the stock certificate(s) representing such Shares.
 Upon the Stockholders execution of this Proxy, any and all prior proxies
given by the undersigned with respect to any Shares are hereby revoked and
terminated, and the Stockholder agrees not to grant any subsequent
proxies with respect to the Shares until after the Expiration Date (as
defined below).

  

This Proxy is irrevocable (to the fullest extent permitted by law),
is coupled with an interest and is granted pursuant to that certain
Stockholder Voting Agreement of even date herewith (the " _Voting Agreement_
") by and among NAVTEQ Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Parent_
"), NAVTEQ Holdings B.V., a corporation organized under the laws of The
Netherlands (" _BV Sub_ "), NAVTEQ Holdings Delaware, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), the
Company and the undersigned Stockholder of the Company, and is granted in
consideration of Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub entering into that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (as it may hereafter be
amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions thereof, the "
_Merger Agreement_ ") by and among Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub and the
Company. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of the Company with and
into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "), and Stockholder will be entitled to
receive a portion of the consideration payable in connection with the Merger.
 The term " _Expiration Date_ ", as used in this Proxy, shall mean the
earlier to occur of (i) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have
been validly terminated pursuant to its terms, (ii) such date and time as the
Merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement or (iii) the occurrence of a Material Adverse
Amendment. The term " _Material Adverse Amendment_ " means an amendment to
the Merger Agreement that (i) materially and adversely affects the
Stockholder and (ii) is approved by the Companys Board of Directors
notwithstanding the fact that in such vote the Stockholders nominee on the
Companys Board of Directors voted against such amendment.

  

The attorneys and proxies named above, and each of them, are
hereby authorized and empowered by the Stockholder, at any time prior during
the Voting Period (as defined in the Voting Agreement), to act as the
Stockholders attorney and proxy to vote all of the Shares, and to exercise
all voting, consent and similar rights of the undersigned with respect to all
of the Shares (including, without limitation, the power to execute and
deliver written consents) at every

  

    

 

  



  

annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company (and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof), and in every written consent in lieu of
such meeting:

  

(a) in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and
approval of the Merger, not including any Material Adverse Amendment;

  

(b) against the approval of any action, proposal, transaction or agreement
that would result, or could reasonably be expected to result, in any material
respect in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement; and

  

(c) against any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with,
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the
Merger Agreement).

  

The attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this Proxy on any
other matter except as provided in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above. The
Stockholder may vote the Shares on all other matters. Notwithstanding
anything in this Proxy to the contrary, if the Stockholder is a director or
officer of the Company, nothing contained in this Proxy shall not limit or
restrict any actions taken by the Stockholder in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Company either (i) pursuant to Applicable Law or
(ii) in exercising the Companys rights or fulfilling the Companys
obligations under the Merger Agreement (to the extent permitted or required
by the Merger Agreement).

  

Any obligation of Stockholder hereunder shall be binding upon the successors
and assigns of Stockholder.

  

This Proxy shall terminate, and be of no further force and
effect, automatically upon the Expiration Date.

defined below), shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the
Merger Agreement.

  

 **RECITALS**

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company,
Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger of even date herewith (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which
the parties thereto have agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, to the Merger;

  

WHEREAS, the Stockholder is the beneficial owner of such number of shares of
common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Common
Stock_ "), set forth on the signature page hereto, and options, warrants or
other rights to acquire such number of shares of Company Common Stock as set
forth on the signature page hereto;

  

WHEREAS, the Stockholder has expressed its intention to elect to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares (as defined below)
beneficially owned by such Stockholder entirely in shares of Parent Common
Stock through the making of a Stock Election;

  

WHEREAS, as a material inducement and a condition to Parent, BV Sub and
Merger Sub entering into the Merger Agreement, Parent has requested that the
Stockholder agree, and the Stockholder has agreed (in the Stockholders
capacity as such), for the benefit of Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub, to enter
into this Agreement to facilitate the consummation of the Merger;

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub and the Stockholder hereby agree as
follows:

  

1. **_Certain Definitions_**. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

 **"** _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earlier to occur of (a) such date
and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been validly terminated pursuant
to its terms, (b) the Effective Time, or (c) the occurrence of a Material
Adverse Amendment; provided, however, that the obligations of the

     

   

Stockholder pursuant to Section 9 hereof shall survive the Expiration Date
and continue for such time as provided in Section 9.

  

" _Material Adverse Amendment_ " means an amendment to the Merger Agreement
that (i) materially and adversely affects the Stockholder and (ii) is
approved by the Companys Board of Directors notwithstanding the fact that in
such vote the Stockholders nominee on the Companys Board of Directors voted
against such amendment.

  

" _Shares_ " means (a) all equity securities of the Company (including all
shares of Company Common Stock, and all options, warrants and other rights to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock) beneficially owned by the Stockholder
as of the date of this Agreement and (b) all additional equity securities of
the Company (including all additional options, warrants and other rights to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock) of which Stockholder acquires
beneficial ownership during the period commencing with the execution and

nothing herein shall obligate the holder to acquire additional equity
securities of the Company, by exercise of options, warrants or other rights
to acquire, or otherwise.

and continuing until the Expiration Date.

  

2. **_Representations and Warranties of Stockholder_**.  The Stockholder represents and warrants to Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub as follows:

13d-3 under the Exchange Act, provided, however, that for the purposes of
this Agreement, such term shall include any Shares that may be acquired more
than sixty (60) days from the date hereof) of all of the Shares. The
Stockholder has sole voting power and the sole power of disposition with
respect to all of the Shares, with no limitations, qualifications or
restrictions on such rights (subject to applicable federal securities laws
and the terms of this Agreement). Such Shares constitute all of the Shares
beneficially owned by the Stockholder. The Shares are held by the Stockholder,
or by a nominee or custodian for the benefit of the Stockholder, free and
clear of all mortgages, claims, charges, liens, security interests, pledges,

(b) The Stockholder has the legal capacity, power and authority, as
applicable, to enter into and perform all of the Stockholders obligations
under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Stockholder and constitutes (assuming due execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub) a valid
and binding agreement of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder
in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general equitable principles. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder will not violate any
agreement

     

   

or court order to which the Stockholder is a party or is subject, including,
without limitation, any voting agreement or voting trust, except for any of
the foregoing as would not impair the Stockholders ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

  

(c) Except for any applicable filings under the Exchange Act, no filing with,
and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Authority or any other Person is required to be made or obtained by the

the Stockholders obligations hereunder.

may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general equitable principles.

  

(b) Except for filings under the Exchange Act, no filing with, and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is
necessary for the execution of this Agreement by the Company, compliance by
the Company with the provisions hereof or performance of its obligations
hereunder.

  

4. **_Representations and Warranties of Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub_**. Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Stockholder as follows:

  

(a) Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub have the corporate power and authority to
enter into and perform all of their respective obligations under this
Agreement.  This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of each of them, enforceable against them in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general
equitable principles.

  

(b) Except for filings under the Exchange Act, no filing with, and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is

or performance of their obligations hereunder.

     

   

5. **_Voting Agreement_**.

  

(a) The Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that,
during the Voting Period, the Stockholder shall (i) appear (in person or by
proxy) at any meeting (whether annual or special and whether or not an
adjourned or postponed meeting) of the holders of Company Common Stock,
properly called, or otherwise cause the Shares then beneficially owned by the
Stockholder to be counted as present thereat for purposes of establishing a
quorum, and (ii) vote or provide a written consent with respect to all Shares
(or will cause all Shares to be voted, or cause a written consent to be
provided with respect to all Shares) (A) in favor of adoption and approval of
the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger, not including any Material
Adverse Amendment, (B) against any action, proposal, transaction or agreement
that would result, or could reasonably be expected to result, in any material
respect in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, and
(C) against any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with,
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including any Acquisition Proposal. In all other matters,
the Shares shall be voted by and in the manner determined by the Stockholder.

  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Stockholder
is a director or officer of the Company, it is expressly understood and
agreed that this Agreement shall not limit or restrict any actions taken by
the Stockholder in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the
Company either (i) pursuant to Applicable Law or (ii) in exercising the
Companys rights or fulfilling the Companys obligations under the Merger
Agreement (to the extent permitted or required by the Merger Agreement).

  

6. **_Grant of Irrevocable Proxy_**. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Stockholder has delivered to Parent a proxy in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Proxy_ ") with respect to the Shares. Such Proxy shall be irrevocable to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.

  

7. **_No Solicitation_**. The Stockholder shall, and shall cause its affiliates that it controls and its and its control affiliates respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, financial and other advisors or other representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, or induce the making, submission or announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent, BV Sub or Merger Sub) any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent, BV Sub or Merger Sub), or take any other action intended to assist or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than to notify such Person as to the existence of this provision), (iv) approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other agreement, contract or arrangement contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition 

     

   

Transaction, or (vi) terminate, amend or waive any rights under any
"standstill" or other similar agreement between the Stockholder and any
Person (other than Parent). The Stockholder shall immediately cease any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any persons (other
than Parent and its affiliates and representatives) conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Stockholder acknowledges and hereby agrees that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7 by the Stockholder or any
representatives of the Stockholder shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 7 by the Stockholder. The Stockholder shall not enter into any letter
of intent or similar document or any agreement contemplating or otherwise
relating to an Acquisition Proposal unless and until this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to its terms.

  

8. ** _No Transfers During Voting Period._** The Stockholder agrees that during the Voting Period, except as expressly contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, such Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly,  (i) sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of (including by merger, testamentary disposition, interspousal disposition pursuant to spousal domestic relations proceedings or otherwise, or otherwise by operation of law) (collectively, " _Transfer_ ") any of the Shares, or enter into any contract, option or other agreement to Transfer any of the Shares, or otherwise cause or permit the Transfer of any Shares, (ii) grant any proxies or powers of attorney or enter into any voting trust or other similar agreements or arrangements with respect to any Shares; (iii) request that the Company register the Transfer of any certificate or uncertificated interest representing any of the Shares, or (iv) take any action that would have the effect of preventing, impeding, interfering with or adversely affecting its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Stockholder hereby agrees that, in order to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to herein, the Company may issue appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent in respect of the Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Stockholder may surrender shares in connection with "cashless" or net exercise provisions of Company Options or Warrants to the extent necessary to effect exercises thereof (including the payment of any taxes required to be withheld and paid with respect to such exercises).

  

9. **_Agreement Regarding Stock Election; Lock-Up_**.

  

(a) The Stockholder agrees that, in connection with the consummation of the
Merger, it shall elect to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such
Shares beneficially owned by such Stockholder entirely in shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Acquired Parent Shares_ ") through the making of a Stock
Election under the Merger Agreement. The Stockholder agrees that it shall
submit one or more Form(s) of Election designating a Stock Election with
respect to all of the Shares and, in the event that the Stockholder
should fail to submit a Form or Form(s) of Election with such designation
with respect to any or all of the Shares, the Stockholder authorizes Parent
and the Exchange Agent to submit a Form or Form(s) of Election with such
designation in the name and on behalf of the Stockholder.

  

(b) The Stockholder agrees that from the Effective Time and continuing for a
period of six (6) months following the Effective Time (the " _Lock-Up
Expiration Date_ "), such Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, (i)
Transfer any of the Acquired Parent Shares, or enter into any contract,
option or other agreement to Transfer any of the Acquired Parent Shares,

     

   

or otherwise cause or permit the Transfer of any Acquired Parent Shares or
(ii) request that the Company register the Transfer of any certificate or
uncertificated interest representing any of the Acquired Parent Shares. The
Stockholder hereby agrees that, in order to ensure compliance with the
restrictions referred to herein, the Company may issue appropriate "stop
transfer" instructions to its transfer agent in respect of the Acquired
Parent Shares. The restrictions on transfer provided in this Section 9(b)
shall be in addition to any restrictions on transfer of the Acquire Parent
Shares imposed by Applicable Law.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Stockholder may Transfer Acquired Parent Shares (i) if such transfer occurs
by operation of law or statutes governing the effects of a merger, (ii) as a
distribution to limited partners of the Stockholder (provided, however, that
such limited partners agree in writing to be bound by the applicable terms of
this Section 9), (iii) at any time after Parent consummates a transaction, or
enters into an agreement, that would cause or result in a Change In Control
of Parent; or (iv) at any time after any agreement that imposes a Transfer
restriction on Parent Acquired Shares by any other stockholder of the Company
has terminated or been amended, or any rights of Parent or obligations of
such stockholder under such agreement have been waived. In addition, the
Stockholder may Transfer up to that number of shares (A) not in excess of
five percent (5%) of the Acquired Parent Shares beneficially owned by the
Stockholder at the Effective Time if the price per share of Parent common
stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") on the date of
initiation of such Transfer is not less than $40, (B) not in excess of 15
percent (15%) (including any shares Transferred pursuant to the immediately
preceding clause (A)) of the Acquired Parent Shares beneficially owned by the
Stockholder at the Effective Time if the price per share of Parent common
stock as reported on the NYSE on the date of the initiation of such Transfer
is not less than $45, and (C) not in excess of 25 percent (25%) (including
any shares Transferred pursuant to the immediately preceding clauses (A) and
(B)) of the Acquired Parent Shares beneficially owned by the Stockholder at
the Effective Time if the price per share of Parent common stock as reported
on the NYSE on the date of the initiation of such Transfer is not less than
$50. For purposes of this paragraph, " _Change In Control_ " means (a) the
direct or indirect acquisition (except for transactions described in clause
(b) of this paragraph below), whether in one or a series of transactions by
any person, or related persons of (i) ownership, beneficial or otherwise, of
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of a party, the result of
which acquisition is that such person or such group possesses 50% or more of
the combined voting power of all then-issued and outstanding capital stock of
such party, or (ii) the power to elect, appoint, or cause the election or
appointment of at least a majority of the members of the board of directors
(or such other governing body in the event a party or any successor entity is
not a corporation); (b) a merger, consolidation or other reorganization or
recapitalization of a party with a person or a direct or indirect subsidiary
of such person, _provided _ that the result of such merger, consolidation or
other reorganization or recapitalization, whether in one or a series of
related transactions, is that the holders of the outstanding voting stock of
such party immediately prior to such consummation do not possess, whether
directly or indirectly, immediately after the consummation of such
transaction, in excess of 50% of the combined voting power of all then-issued
and outstanding stock of the merged, consolidated, reorganized or
recapitalized person, its direct or indirect parent, or the surviving person
of such transaction; (c) the stockholders of a party approve a plan of
complete liquidation of such party; or (d) a sale

     

   

or disposition, whether in one or a series of transactions, of all or
substantially all of a partys assets.

  

10 _. **Acquisition of Additional Shares**_.

  

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the Expiration Date, the Stockholder
shall promptly notify Parent of the number of any additional shares of
Company Common Stock and the number and type of any other voting securities
of the Company acquired by the Stockholder, if any, after the date hereof.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall obligate the Stockholder to exercise any option, warrant or
other right to acquire Shares.

  

(b) In the event of a stock dividend or distribution, or any change in the
Shares by reason of any stock dividend or distribution, split-up,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the term
"Shares" shall be deemed to refer to and include the Shares as well as all
such stock dividends and distributions and any securities into which or for
which any or all of the Shares may be changed or exchanged or which are
received in such transaction.

  

11. **_No Ownership Interest_**. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shares. Except as provided in this Agreement, all rights, ownership and economic benefits relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Stockholder.

  

12. **_Disclosure_**.  The Stockholder hereby agrees to permit Parent to publish and disclose in the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including all documents and schedules filed with the SEC), and in any press release or other disclosure document which Parent reasonably determines to be necessary or desirable to comply with applicable law or the rules and regulations of The New York Stock Exchange in connection with the Merger and any transactions related thereto, the Stockholders identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of the Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement, provided that any public announcement or disclosure is made in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and the requirements of Applicable Law, subject to Parent using its reasonable best efforts to consult with the Stockholder and giving the Stockholder the right to review and comment upon any such disclosure. In addition, the Stockholder will cooperate with Parent in connection with the filing of any Schedule 13D or amendment thereto that Parent reasonably determines is required under the Exchange Act in connection with this Agreement.

  

13. **_Consent and Waiver_. **The Stockholder hereby gives any consents or waivers that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under the terms of any agreement or instrument to which the Stockholder is a party. Without limiting the generality of or effect of the foregoing, the Stockholder hereby waives any and all rights to contest or object to the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the actions of the Board of Directors of the Company in approving and recommending the Merger, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or to seek damages or other legal or equitable relief in connection therewith. From and after the Effective Time, the Stockholders 

     

   

right to receive its portion of the Merger Consideration on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement shall constitute
the Stockholders sole and exclusive right against the Company and/or Parent
or Merger Sub in respect of the Stockholders status as a stockholder of the
Company.

  

14. **_Confidentiality_. **The Stockholder shall hold any information regarding this Agreement and the Merger in strict confidence and shall not divulge any such information to any third person (except to affiliates and to its limited partners, investment bankers, attorneys, financial and other advisors) until the Parent has publicly disclosed the Merger, except for disclosures which the Stockholders legal counsel advises are necessary in order to fulfill such Stockholders obligations imposed by law, in which event the Stockholder shall give prior notice of such disclosure to Parent as promptly as practicable.  Subject to the exception in the immediately preceding sentence, neither the Stockholder, nor any of its affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger, the Merger Agreement or other transactions contemplated thereby.

  

15. **_Termination_**. This Agreement shall automatically terminate (without requirement of further action or notice) on the Expiration Date; provided, however, that the provisions of Section 9(b) shall continue in effect after the Expiration Date until the Lock-Up Expiration Date and the provisions of Section 13 and Section 16 shall continue in effect with respect to Section 9(b) until the Lock-Up Termination Date.

  

16. **_Miscellaneous_**.

  

(a) This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by written
agreement of the parties.

  

(b) Any failure of the Stockholder, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition herein may be waived by Parent (with respect to any failure by the
Stockholder) or the Stockholder (with respect to any failure by Parent or
Merger Sub), respectively, only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.  Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf
of any party hereto, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner
consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in
this Section 16(b).

  

(c) All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and
shall be delivered personally by overnight courier or similar means or sent
by facsimile with written confirmation of receipt, to the parties at the

specified by like notice. Any such notice shall be effective upon receipt, if

(d) Neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder
shall be assigned by either of the parties hereto without the prior written
consent of the other party. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and its and their successors and
permitted assigns and shall be binding upon the Stockholder and the
Stockholders heirs, successors and assigns by will or by the laws of
descent. This Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or remedies
hereunder upon any other person except the parties hereto.

  

(e) This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflicts of law
provisions.

  

(f) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT
ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF
ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR
OTHERWISE.

  

(g) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction
and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery or any court of the United States
located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of
Chancery or, if under Applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter
is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United

     

   

States located in the State of Delaware and (iv) consents to service being
made through the notice procedures set forth in 
 Section 16(c). Each party hereby agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth herein for the delivery of notices generally shall be
effective service of process for any legal proceeding in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(h) This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

  

(i) In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement
should be finally determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect against a party hereto, it shall be adjusted if possible to effect
the intent of the parties. In any event, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby, and such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall only apply as to such party in the specific
jurisdiction where such final determination shall have been made.

  

(j) The section headings contained in this Agreement are solely for the
purpose of reference and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The word "including" shall be deemed to
mean "including without limitation."

  

(k) This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are
no representations, promises, warranties, covenants, or undertakings, other
than those expressly set forth or referred to herein and therein.

  

(l) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to
perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take
all actions as are necessary on its part in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement to facilitate the Merger, will cause irreparable
injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available, will not
be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the
issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction
to compel performance of such partys obligations and to the granting by any
court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder.

  

(m) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

  

(n) All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses; provided, however, that Parent shall reimburse the reasonable legal
fees and expenses incurred by Stockholder up to a maximum of $20,000.

     

   

(o) Each party to this Agreement has been represented by counsel during the
preparation and execution of this Agreement, and therefore waives any rule of
construction that would construe ambiguities against the party drafting the
agreement.

  

(p) From time to time, at the other partys request and without further
consideration, each party hereto shall execute and deliver such additional
documents and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 ** _EXHIBIT A_**

  

 **IRREVOCABLE PROXY**

  

The undersigned Stockholder (the " _Stockholder_ ") of Traffic.com, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), hereby irrevocably (to the fullest
extent permitted by law) appoints each of Judson D. Green, David Mullen and
Lawrence M. Kaplan of NAVTEQ Corporation, as the sole and exclusive attorneys
and proxies of the undersigned, with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, to vote and exercise all voting and related rights (to the
full extent that the undersigned is entitled to do so) with respect to all of
the shares of capital stock of the Company that now are or hereafter may be
beneficially owned by the undersigned, and any and all other shares or
securities of the Company issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after
the date hereof (collectively, the " _Shares_ "), in accordance with the
terms of this Proxy. The Shares beneficially owned by the Stockholder as of
the date of this Proxy are listed on the signature page of this Proxy, along
with the number(s) of the stock certificate(s) representing such Shares.
 Upon the Stockholders execution of this Proxy, any and all prior proxies
given by the undersigned with respect to any Shares are hereby revoked and
terminated, and the Stockholder agrees not to grant any subsequent
proxies with respect to the Shares until after the Expiration Date (as
defined below).

  

This Proxy is irrevocable (to the fullest extent permitted by law),
is coupled with an interest and is granted pursuant to that certain
Stockholder Voting Agreement of even date herewith (the " _Voting Agreement_
") by and among NAVTEQ Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Parent_
"), NAVTEQ Holdings B.V., a corporation organized under the laws of The
Netherlands (" _BV Sub_ "), NAVTEQ Holdings Delaware, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), the
Company and the undersigned Stockholder of the Company, and is granted in
consideration of Parent, BV Sub and Merger Sub entering into that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (as it may hereafter be
amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions thereof, the "
_Merger Agreement_ ") by and among Parent, BV Sub, Merger Sub and the
Company. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of the Company with and
into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "), and Stockholder will be entitled to
receive a portion of the consideration payable in connection with the Merger.
 The term " _Expiration Date_ ", as used in this Proxy, shall mean the
earlier to occur of (i) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have
been validly terminated pursuant to its terms, (ii) such date and time as the
Merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement or (iii) the occurrence of a Material Adverse
Amendment. The term " _Material Adverse Amendment_ " means an amendment to
the Merger Agreement that (i) materially and adversely affects the
Stockholder and (ii) is approved by the Companys Board of Directors
notwithstanding the fact that in such vote the Stockholders nominee on the
Companys Board of Directors voted against such amendment.

  

The attorneys and proxies named above, and each of them, are
hereby authorized and empowered by the Stockholder, at any time prior during
the Voting Period (as defined in the Voting Agreement), to act as the
Stockholders attorney and proxy to vote all of the Shares, and to exercise
all voting, consent and similar rights of the undersigned with respect to all
of the Shares (including, without limitation, the power to execute and
deliver written consents) at every

  



  

    

 

  



  

annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company (and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof), and in every written consent in lieu of
such meeting:

  

(a) in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and
approval of the Merger, not including any Material Adverse Amendment;

  

(b) against the approval of any action, proposal, transaction or agreement
that would result, or could reasonably be expected to result, in any material
respect in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement; and

  

(c) against any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with,
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the
Merger Agreement).

  

The attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this Proxy on any
other matter except as provided in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above. The
Stockholder may vote the Shares on all other matters. Notwithstanding
anything in this Proxy to the contrary, if the Stockholder is a director or
officer of the Company, nothing contained in this Proxy shall not limit or
restrict any actions taken by the Stockholder in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Company either (i) pursuant to Applicable Law or
(ii) in exercising the Companys rights or fulfilling the Companys
obligations under the Merger Agreement (to the extent permitted or required
by the Merger Agreement).

  

Any obligation of Stockholder hereunder shall be binding upon the successors
and assigns of Stockholder.

  

This Proxy shall terminate, and be of no further force and
effect, automatically upon the Expiration Date.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

The undersigned has been advised that as of the date hereof the undersigned
may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Traffic.com, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), as the term "affiliate" is defined for
purposes of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and_

  

 _Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ ").
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
November 6, 2006 (the " _Agreement_ "), by and among NAVTEQ Holdings B.V., a
corporation organized under the laws of The Netherlands (" _BV Sub_ "),
NAVTEQ Holdings Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ") and the Company, the Company will be
merged with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ ").

  

As a result of the Merger, the undersigned will be entitled to receive cash
and shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent (the "
_Parent Common Stock_ ") in exchange for shares of common stock of the
Company owned by the undersigned. In connection therewith, the undersigned
hereby represents and warrants to, and covenants with, Parent as set forth
below and acknowledges and agrees that the execution and delivery of this
Affiliate Agreement by the undersigned is a material inducement to Parent, BV
Sub and Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement.

  

(a) The undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of
the Parent Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

  

(b) The undersigned has carefully read this Affiliate Agreement and discussed
its requirements and other applicable limitations upon the undersigneds
ability to offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Parent Common
Stock, to the extent the undersigned believes necessary, with the
undersigneds counsel.

  

(c) The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock to the undersigned in connection with the Merger is expected to
be registered by Parent under the Act through the filing by Parent of a
Registration Statement with the Commission on Form S-4. However, the
undersigned has also been advised that because at the time the Merger was
submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, the undersigned may
be deemed an

     

   

affiliate of the Company, and the distribution by the undersigned of the
Parent Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, the undersigned
may not offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock
issued to the undersigned in connection with the Merger unless (i) such
offer, sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act,
(ii) such offer, sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity
with the volume and other applicable limitations imposed by Rule 145 under
the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent or under a "no-action" letter or interpretative letter
obtained by the undersigned from the staff of the Commission, such offer,
sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration
under the Act.

  

(d) The undersigned understands that Parent will be under no obligation to
register the offer, sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Common
Stock by the undersigned or on the undersigneds behalf under the Act.

  

(e) The undersigned understands that stop transfer instructions will be given
to Parents transfer agent with respect to the Parent Common Stock owned by
the undersigned and that there may be placed on the certificates for the
Parent Common Stock issued to the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor,
a legend substantially in the following form:

  

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 COVERING THE RESALE OF SUCH SHARES OR IN ACCORDANCE
WITH AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."

  

(f) The undersigned also understands that unless undersigned certifies to
Parent that the transfer by the undersigned of the undersigneds Parent
Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a transfer made in
conformity with the provisions of this Affiliate Agreement, Parent reserves
the right, in its sole discretion, to place the a substantially similar
legend as that set forth in (e) above on the certificates issued to any
transferee of shares from the undersigned.

  

(g) By Parents execution of this Affiliate Agreement, Parent hereby agrees
with the undersigned as follows:

  

(1) For so long as Parent is obligated to file reports pursuant to Section 13
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "),
Parent shall (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) file, on a
timely basis, all reports and data required to be filed with the Commission
by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act and (ii) furnish to the
undersigned upon request a written statement as to whether

     

   

Parent has complied with such reporting requirements during the 12 months
preceding any proposed sale of the Parent Common Stock by the undersigned
under Rule 145, and (b) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to
permit such sales pursuant to Rule 145 and Rule 144. Parent
hereby represents to the undersigned that it has filed all reports required
to be filed with the Commission under Section 13 of the Exchange Act during
the 12 months preceding the date of this Affiliate Agreement.

  

(2) It is understood and agreed that an offer, sale or other transfer of the
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be permitted and the legends in paragraph
(e) or (f) above shall be removed in connection therewith by delivery of
substitute certificates without such legend if the undersigned shall have
delivered to Parent (i) a copy of a "no action" or interpretive letter from
the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such offer sale or
other transfer is permissible under the Act and/or such legend is not
required for purposes of the Act, (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that the offer,
sale or other transfer of such shares by the holder thereof is no
longer subject to Rule 145, or (iii) satisfactory evidence that the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented by such certificates are being or have
been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of
Rule 145.

  

(3) It is understood and agreed that an offer, sale or other transfer of the
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be permitted and the legends in paragraph
(e) or (f) above shall be removed in connection therewith by delivery of
substitute certificates without such legend if (i) one year shall have
elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the Parent Common Stock
received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then
available to the undersigned or (ii) two years shall have elapsed from the
date the undersigned acquired the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger
and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then applicable to the undersigned.

  

Execution of this Affiliate Agreement should not be considered an admission
on the undersigneds part that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of the
Company as described in the first paragraph of this Affiliate Agreement or as
a waiver of any rights the undersigned may have to object to any claim that
the undersigned is such an affiliate on or after the date of this Affiliate
Agreement.

       

Very truly yours,
