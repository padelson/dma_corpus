ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER

  



  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, (a) Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), and (b) the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will
continue its corporate existence under the DGCL as the surviving corporation
in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_
").

  



  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
will take place at 10:00 a.m. (CST), as soon as practicable (and, in any
event, within three (3) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in
_ARTICLE VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all such conditions), unless this Agreement
has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the
offices of Sirote and Permutt, P.C., 2311 Highland Avenue South, Birmingham,
Alabama 35205 (unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto) or by fax, pdf or other electronic exchange of the signature pages
and other deliveries required at the Closing. The actual date of the Closing
is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ".

  



  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will cause a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed,
acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger will become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date or time
as may be agreed upon in writing by the Company and Parent and specified in
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of
the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after
the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At the
Effective Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be
amended so as to read in its entirety as set forth in __Exhibit A__ attached
hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms
thereof or as provided by applicable Law, and (b) the bylaws of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation (except that the name of the corporation shall be
"Golden Enterprises, Inc.") until thereafter amended in accordance with the
terms thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
or as provided by applicable Law.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers
of Merger Sub, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors and officers,
respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  



  

Section 2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the
Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

  



  

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
(as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries will automatically be cancelled and
retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  



  

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than (i) shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with
_Section 2.1(a)_ , and (ii) Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the
right to receive $12.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

  



  

(c) _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and all shares of
Company Common Stock will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist,
and, subject to _Section 2.3_ , each holder of a certificate formerly
representing any such shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") will cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2_ hereof.

  



  

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to act
as the agent for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for: (i)
the Certificates, or (ii) book-entry shares which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented the shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Book-
Entry Shares_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Exchange Agent, sufficient funds
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificates and the
Book-Entry Shares (the " _Payment Fund_ ") in amounts and at the times
necessary for such payments. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment
Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company
Common Stock shall be entitled under _Section 2.1(b)_ , Parent shall deposit
or shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving
Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Exchange
Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for
the payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  



  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common
Stock represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon (i) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry
Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, and subject
to the terms set forth in _Section 2.3_ , each such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon
the surrender or transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Upon
payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this
_ARTICLE II_ , each Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled.

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry
Share shall be properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as
a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable.

  



  

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this _ARTICLE II_.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two
(2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior
to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 2.1_ , shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_) and held
by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights
of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of
Company Common Stock being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting
Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise
loses such holder's appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such
shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however,_ that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder's
right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled
to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company
Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ , without interest thereon, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Book-
Entry Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent prompt
written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have
the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions
of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of
additional shares of capital stock of the Company as permitted by this
Agreement), including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
distribution paid in stock, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such change.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this _ARTICLE II_ such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and applicable Treasury
Regulations, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Exchange Agent,
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in a form
acceptable to Parent) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate as contemplated under this  _ARTICLE II_.

  



  

Section 2.7 _Treatment of Stock Options_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the
Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the holder of that Company Stock Option or any other Person,
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise price under such Company Stock
Option, less any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with _Section
2.5_. The Surviving Corporation will not assume any options to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock nor substitute any options to acquire shares of the
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company
Board, the compensation committee of the Company Board and/or the
stock option committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any employee consents)
that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b)
of this _Section 2.7_.

  



  

ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  



  

Except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered Section of the disclosure
letter, dated the date of this Agreement and delivered by the Company
to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ "), that relates to such Section or in another Section of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such Section, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  



  

Section 3.1 _Organization; Standing and Power; Charter Documents;
Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(a) _Organization; Standing and Power_. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or other legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) under the Laws of
its jurisdiction of organization, and has the requisite corporate, limited
liability company or other organizational, as applicable, power and authority
to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, limited liability
company or other legal entity and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) in
each jurisdiction where the character of the assets and properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or license necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

(b) _Charter Documents_. The Company has Made Available to Parent
a correct and complete copy of the certificate of incorporation
(including any certificate of designations), bylaws or like organizational
documents, each as amended to date (collectively, the " _Charter Documents_
"), of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its Charter
Documents.

  



  

(c) _Subsidiaries_.  _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter lists each of the direct and indirect Subsidiaries of the Company, its
place of organization, the owner of each outstanding share of capital stock
of each such Subsidiary and the number of shares owned. Each such Subsidiary
is wholly-owned by either the Company or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
or voting interests in, each such Subsidiary have been validly issued, were
issued free of pre-emptive rights and are fully paid and non-assessable, and
are free and clear of all Liens, including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or
voting interests, except for any Liens imposed by applicable securities Laws.
Except for the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, its
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any Person.

(ii) solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or
encourage the submission of any Takeover Proposal or the making of any
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal,
or, subject to _Section 5.5(b)_ , conduct or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, disclose any non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to, afford access to the business, properties,

cause its Subsidiaries to cease immediately and cause to be terminated, and
shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their Representatives
to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if

any Takeover Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
such third party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public
information in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was
furnished by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries to return or

 | 31| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 5.5(a)_ , if a third party has
delivered to the Company (and not withdrawn), prior to the termination of the
Takeover Proposal Review Period, a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal
in writing that did not result from a breach of _Section 5.5(a)_  that the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and the Financial Advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through any Representative, may, subject
to _Section 5.5(c)_ , (i) contact such third party that has delivered to the
Company (and not withdrawn), prior to the termination of the Takeover
Proposal Review Period, such Takeover Proposal in order to clarify the terms
of such Takeover Proposal so that the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) may inform itself about such Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in
negotiations or discussions with such third party, (iii) thereafter furnish
to such third party non-public information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement that
constitutes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be
promptly (in all events within twenty-four (24) hours) provided for
informational purposes to Parent), (iv) following receipt of and on account
of a Superior Proposal, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and/or
(v) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the
Company to take (which order remains unstayed), but in each case referred to
in the foregoing clauses (i) through (v), only if the Company Board concludes
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to cause the Company
Board to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.5_ , the
Company Board may not consider or take any other action with respect to any
Takeover Proposal delivered to the Company after the termination of the
Takeover Proposal Review Period. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the
Company Board from disclosing to the Company's stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to a Takeover Proposal, if the Company determines,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such
position would constitute a violation of applicable Law.

  



  

(c) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions permitted in
clauses (i) through (v) of _Section 5.5(b)_ unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event
later than twenty-four (24) hours) after it obtains Knowledge of the receipt
by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Takeover Proposal, any
inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, any
request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party. In such
notice, the Company shall identify the third party making, and details of the
material terms and conditions of, any such Takeover Proposal, indication or
request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt
basis, of the status and material terms of any such Takeover
Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company
shall provide Parent with at least forty-eight (48) hours prior notice of any
meeting of the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is provided to the
members of the Company Board) at which the Company Board is reasonably
expected to consider any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly
provide Parent with a list of any non-public information concerning the
Company's business, present or future performance, financial condition or
results of operations, provided to any third party, and, to the extent
such information has not been previously provided to Parent, copies of such
information.

  



  

   

 | 32| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.5(d)_ , the Company Board
shall not make any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or
permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a third party has delivered to the Company
(and not withdrawn), prior to the termination of the Takeover Proposal Review
Period, a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal in writing that did not
result from a breach of _Section 5.5(a)_ that the Company Board concludes in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Financial
Advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary
to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, if: (i) the Company promptly
notifies Parent, in writing, at least two (2) Business Days (the " _Notice
Period_ ") before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering
into (or causing a Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement,
of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal,
which notice shall state expressly that the Company has received a Takeover
Proposal in accordance with the terms of this _Section 5.5(d)_ that the
Company Board intends to declare a Superior Proposal and that the Company
Board intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the
Company intends to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement; (ii) the
Company attaches to such notice the most current version of the proposed
agreement (which version shall be updated on a prompt basis) and the identity
of the third party making such Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases
to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to
make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after
commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the
terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, each of the
Notice Period and the Takeover Proposal Review Period shall be extended, if
applicable, but only so long as a third party delivered to the Company (and
did not later withdraw) prior to the termination of the unextended Takeover
Proposal Review Period, a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal in writing
that did not result from a breach of _Section 5.5(a)_ that the Company Board
concluded in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
the Financial Advisor, constituted a Superior Proposal, to ensure that at
least two (2) Business Days remains in the Notice Period subsequent to the
time the Company notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being
understood that there may be multiple extensions)); and (iv) the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and the
Financial Advisor, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent
during the Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



    

 | 33| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which shall
be subject to _Section 5.5(d)_ but not this _Section 5.5(e)_ ), prior to
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote the Company Board may take any action
otherwise prohibited by _clause (i)_ of  _Section 5.5(a)_ , but only in
response to a Company Intervening Event and only if (i) the Company has
notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change due to the occurrence of a Company Intervening Event
(which notice shall specify the Company Intervening Event in reasonable
detail); (ii) for a period of five (5) Business Days' following delivery of
the notice pursuant to the foregoing _clause (i)_ of this _Section 5.5(e)_ ,
the Company Board shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith and made
Company Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in
each case to the extent Parent desires to negotiate), with Parent
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary
duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any material
change to the facts and circumstances relating to the Company Intervening
Event shall require a new notice and a three (3) Business Day negotiation
period; and (iii) no earlier than the end of the last applicable negotiation
period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement, that the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Stockholder Consent; Information Statement._

  



     

(a) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement and in lieu of
calling a meeting of the Company's stockholders, the Company shall submit a

not file the Information Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto,

definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Company's

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Information Statement which shall have become
false or misleading and the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its
stockholders an amendment or supplement setting forth such correction. The
Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable (i) notify Parent of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the Information Statement
and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Information Statement or

written correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Information
Statement.

affected by any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any
other Person of any Takeover Proposal. In the event the Stockholder Consent is
not obtained and Parent does not terminate this Agreement, then the Company
shall, as soon as practicable, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement
related to the Merger and this Agreement and shall take all action necessary
to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of adopting this Agreement and use its

Section 5.7 _Notices of Certain Events_. The Company shall notify
Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the Company,
promptly of (a) any material notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection

or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) any Legal Actions commenced
or to such parties' knowledge, threatened in writing, against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, that are
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (d) any
event, change or effect between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause the failure of
the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ , _Section 6.2(b)_ or _Section
6.2(c)_ of this Agreement (in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries) or
_Section 6.3(a)_  or _Section 6.3(b)_ of this Agreement (in the case of
Parent and Merger Sub), to be satisfied. From time to time, up until the date
that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall have the right (but not the obligation) to supplement or
amend the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to any matters hereafter
arising (each a " _Schedule Supplement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
for purposes of determining whether or not the condition set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)_ of this Agreement has been satisfied, such Schedule
Supplement shall (for the purposes of _Section 6.2(a)_ of this Agreement
only) not be deemed to satisfy the otherwise unsatisfied condition in such
section; _provided, however,_ that if, due to the matters disclosed by the
Company in any Schedule Supplement, Parent determines to exercise its right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ , Parent shall
deliver the written notice required by such  _Section 7.3(b)_ within ten (10)
Business Days following its receipt of such Schedule Supplement. Except as
specifically set forth in this _Section 5.7_ , in no event shall (x) the
delivery of any notice by a party pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ limit or
otherwise affect the respective rights, obligations, representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement, or (y) disclosure by the
Company or Parent be deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure
Letter or constitute an exception to any representation or warranty. This 
_Section 5.7_ shall not constitute a covenant or agreement for purposes of
_Section 6.2(b)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_.

     



  

Section 5.8 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

  

     



  

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time (or if earlier, the date of
the employee's termination of employment with Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation)), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries while employed during such
period (collectively, the " _Company Continuing Employees_ ") with
base salary, target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation), and employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable than the base salary, target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-
based compensation), and employee benefits provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, excluding both any retiree healthcare plans or programs
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and any equity
compensation arrangements maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Company Continuing
Employees will participate effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the
Company Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, as if such service were with Parent, for vesting and
eligibility purposes (but not for (i) purposes of early retirement subsidies
under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan or (ii)
benefit accrual purposes, except for vacation, if applicable) in any Parent
Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time; provided that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that (x) such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits or (y) such service was not recognized under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan.

(c) This  _Section 5.8_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section 5.8_ , express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 5.8_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 5.8_
shall not create any right in any Company Employee or any other Person to any
continued employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or compensation or benefits of any nature or
kind whatsoever.

  



  

(d) With respect to matters described in this _Section 5.8_ , the
Company will not send any written notices or other written

Section 5.9 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and
Insurance_.

  



     

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor
of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company
or its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the
Company Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof
and disclosed in _Section 5.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action,
at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any
proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until
the final disposition of such proceeding or claim.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or
in part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), and shall reimburse each Indemnified Party
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses
are incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporation's receipt of an undertaking
by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses
paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law; 
_provided, however,_ that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any
settlement effected without the Surviving Corporation's prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

   

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of six
(6) years after the Effective Time, if available, the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies, of at least the same coverage
and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not materially less
advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company as
of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain as of the Effective Time "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with
at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions
that are not materially less advantageous to the directors and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to claims
arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the
Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement); _provided, however,_ that in no event will the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement, which amount
is set forth on _Section 5.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "
_Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an
annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Surviving
Corporation will obtain, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to
obtain, that amount of directors' and officers' insurance (or "tail"
coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

  



     

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under
this _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 5.9_  applies without the written
consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_ , each of whom may enforce the provisions
of this _Section 5.9_ ).

  



  

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_. The agreements and covenants
contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to
which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section
5.9_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, and
to satisfy all conditions to, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary permits, waivers, consents, approvals and actions or nonactions

and Parent shall, subject to applicable Law, promptly (x) cooperate and
coordinate with the other in the taking of the actions contemplated by
the preceding sentence, and (y) supply the other with any information that
may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the taking of the actions
contemplated by the preceding sentence. Each party hereto shall promptly
inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If the Company or Parent receives a request
for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then
it shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as

appropriate response in compliance with such request, and, if permitted by
applicable Law and by any applicable Governmental Entity, provide the other
party's counsel with advance notice and the opportunity to attend and
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of

permit their respective Subsidiaries to commit to or agree) with any
Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior
written consent of the other (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

  



  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to
_Section 5.10(a)_ hereof, the parties hereto shall (i) provide or cause to
be provided as promptly as reasonably practicable to Governmental Entities
with jurisdiction over the Antitrust Laws (each such Governmental Entity, a "
_Governmental Antitrust Authority_ ") information and documents requested
by any Governmental Antitrust Authority as necessary, proper or advisable to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including preparing and filing any notification and report form and related
material required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings
under any other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement (provided that in the case of the filing under the HSR Act,
such filing shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this
Agreement) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request
for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the
HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws and (ii) subject to the terms
set forth in _Section 5.10(c)_ hereof, use their reasonable best efforts to
take such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any
Governmental Entity or expiration of applicable waiting periods.

(c) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a
Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate in all respects, discuss in good faith actions to take and use
their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be
required to, and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise
take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or Order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer,
divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion
of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries which, in the case of the
foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , could have a material adverse effect on
the business, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise), or
assets of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a
release mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent. Thereafter, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that no public release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party
without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be permitted by _Section 5.5_ or required by applicable Law
or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities
exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is subject,
wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other
party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance.

share acquisition", "fair price", "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Law

Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective boards of directors
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-
takeover Law inapplicable to the foregoing.
