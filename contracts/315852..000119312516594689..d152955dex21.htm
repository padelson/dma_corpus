issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this _Section
3.3(a)_ and _Sections 3.3(g)_ and _3.3(h)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares
in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions
in accordance with _Section 3.3(g)_) shall hereinafter be referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_." The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the
exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration. Any interest or other income
resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall
become part of the Exchange Fund.

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event more than three Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, of (A) an outstanding certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B) shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), a letter of transmittal
(" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter
of Transmittal, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent
and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the
surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration set forth in
_Section 3.1(b)(i)_.

 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested by such holder) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount
equal to the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and dividends and other distributions
pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other

 



17  than the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock, it shall be a
condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.3(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.3(g)_.

 

(c) _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration (including any dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.3(g)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_) paid upon the surrender of and in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed immediately, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other
than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing shares of Company Common
Stock described in _clause (iii)_ of _Section 3.1(b)_), any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_, without any interest thereon.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the 365th
day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation,
upon demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, in each case
without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this _Article III_
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment
of their claim for such amounts. 

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for
any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time
that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration

 



18  in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other than
a Certificate evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in _clause
(iii)_ of _Section 3.1(b)_) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends
or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.3(g)_.

 

(g) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with
respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would
be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall
surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this
_Section 3.3_. Following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares
of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates or scrip
or shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of
Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall 

 



19  receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of Parent Common Stock
for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date as
reported by Bloomberg, L.P. As promptly as reasonably practicable after
Parents receipt of written notification from the Exchange Agent of the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to forward
payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance
with the terms hereof.

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct or withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any
holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement any amount required
to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so properly deducted or
withheld by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made by the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

 

3.4 _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Transactions.

Except (i) as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this
Agreement and delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior
to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and (ii)
as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (excluding any disclosures set forth
in any such Company SEC Documents in any risk factor section, any forward-
looking disclosure in any section relating to forward-looking statements or
any other statements that are non-specific, predictive or primarily cautionary
in nature other than historical facts included therein), where the relevance
of the information as an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a
particular representation is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (a) is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company
duly organized, as the case may be, validly existing and in good standing

properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and (c) is
duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing
of its properties, makes such qualification necessary, other than where the
failure to be duly organized, validly existing, or to so qualify or be in good
standing has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company (a " _Company
Material Adverse Effect_ "). The Company has heretofore made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of its

  



20  Organizational Documents, as well as the equivalent organizational documents
of each Subsidiary, in each case as of the date hereof. The respective
jurisdictions of formation of each Subsidiary of the Company are identified

Common Stock and (b) 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share (" _Company Preferred Stock_ " and, together with the Company Common
Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_ "). At the close of business on May 13,

assessable and are not subject to preemptive rights. All outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock have been issued and granted in compliance in all
material respects with (i) applicable securities Laws and other applicable Law
and (ii) all requirements set forth in applicable contracts. As of the close
of business on May 13, 2016, there are no outstanding options, warrants or
other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire from the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries any capital stock of the Company or securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock of the Company (and the
exercise, conversion, purchase, exchange or other similar price thereof). All
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Subsidiaries of the Company that
are owned by the Company, or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Company, are free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted
Encumbrances. Except as set forth in this _Section 4.2_, and except for stock
grants or other awards granted in accordance with _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_,

Subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which it is bound in any case
obligating the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to issue, deliver,
sell, purchase, redeem or acquire, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold,
purchased, redeemed or acquired, additional shares of Company Capital Stock
or any Voting Debt or other voting securities of the Company, or obligating
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or enter into
any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. Other than the
Existing Voting Agreement, there are not any stockholder agreements, voting
trusts or other agreements to which the Company is a party or by which it is
bound relating to the voting of any shares of the Company Capital Stock. As of
the date of this Agreement, the Company has no (x) material joint venture or
other similar material equity interests in any Person or (y) obligations,
whether contingent or otherwise, to consummate any material additional
investment in any Person other than its Subsidiaries.

4.3 _Authority; No Violations; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) Assuming the accuracy of the representation in _Section 5.17_, the
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject to the Company Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the Transactions. Assuming the

delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company
of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company, subject, with respect to Merger, to the
Company Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the accuracy of the representation in
_Section 5.17_ and that this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject,
as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
and other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general principles of equity regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a Proceeding in equity or at law
(collectively, " _Creditors  Rights_"). The Company Board, at a meeting duly
called and held by unanimous vote, (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in
the best interests of, the Companys stockholders, (ii) approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the holders of Company
Common Stock approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger (such recommendation described in
_clause (iii)_ , the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). Assuming the
accuracy of the representation in _Section 5.17_, the Company Stockholder
Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the
Companys capital stock necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Merger.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the Transactions will not, result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
acceleration of any material obligation or the loss, suspension, limitation or
impairment of a material benefit under (or right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to own or use any assets or properties required for the conduct
of their respective businesses, including any of the Oil and Gas Properties

Encumbrance or any rights of termination, cancellation, first offer or first
refusal, in each case, with respect to any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any of their Oil and Gas Properties) under, any provision of (i) the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
assuming the accuracy of the representation in _Section 5.17_, any loan or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement,

is a party or by which it or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their
respective properties or assets are bound, or (iii) assuming the accuracy of
the representation in _Section 5.17_ and assuming the consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, filings or permits referred to in
_Section 4.4_ are duly and timely obtained or made and the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, any Law applicable to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other
than, in the case of _clauses (ii)_ and  _(iii)_ , any such violations,
defaults, acceleration, losses, or Encumbrances that have not had and would
not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default or violation
(and no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or violation) of any term, condition or provision
of (i) the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries or (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, 

 



22  bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, permit, franchise or
license to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is now a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets is bound, except for defaults or violations that have not
had and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.4 _Consents_. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from any Governmental
Entity is required to be obtained or made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, except

individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(y) an agreement or arrangement solely among the members of a group the common
parent of which is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (z) any Tax
sharing or indemnification provisions contained in any agreement entered into
in the ordinary course of business and not primarily relating to Tax (e.g.,
leases, credit agreements or other commercial agreements)), (ii) will be

the imposition of Tax on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Section
355(e) of the Code as a result of the Transactions.

(h) After reasonable diligence, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is aware of the existence of any fact, or has taken or agreed to

4.14 _Intellectual Property_. The Company and its Subsidiaries own or have the
right to use all Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of the
businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted
(collectively, the " _Company Intellectual Property_ ") free and clear of all
Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances, except where the failure to
own or have the right to use such properties has not had and would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, the use of the
Company Intellectual Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
operation of the business of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
presently conducted does not infringe upon or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property of any other Person, except for such matters that have
not had and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of trade
secrets used in the businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
presently conducted, except where failure to do so has not had and would not
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



29 4.15 _Real Property_. Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
and except with respect to any of the Companys Oil and Gas Properties, (a)
the Company and its Subsidiaries have good, valid and defensible title to all
material real property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Company Owned Real Property_ ") and valid leasehold
estates in all material real property leased, subleased, licensed or otherwise
occupied (whether as tenant, subtenant or pursuant to other occupancy
arrangements) by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (collectively,
including the improvements thereon, the " _Company Material Leased Real
Property_ ") free and clear of all Encumbrances, except Permitted
Encumbrances, (b) each agreement under which the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company is the landlord, sublandlord, tenant, subtenant, or occupant with
respect to the Company Material Leased Real Property (each, a " _Company
Material Real Property Lease_ ") to the knowledge of the Company is in full
force and effect and is valid and enforceable against the parties thereto in
accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to Creditors
Rights, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, or to the
knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, has received written notice
of any default under any Company Material Real Property Lease, and a true,
correct and complete copy of each Company Material Real Property Lease has
been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof, and (c) there does not
exist any pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
condemnation or eminent domain proceedings that affect any of the Companys
Oil and Gas Properties, Company Owned Real Property or Company Material Leased
Real Property.

 

4.16 _Oil and Gas Matters_.

 

(a) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect and except for property (i) sold or otherwise
disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the dates of the reserve
report prepared by Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (the " _Company
Independent Petroleum Engineers_ ") relating to the Company interests
referred to therein as of December 31, 2015 (the " _Company Reserve Report_ ")
or (ii) reflected in the Company Reserve Report or in the Company SEC
Documents as having been sold or otherwise disposed of, as of the date
hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries have good and defensible title to all
Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the
Company Reserve Report and in each case as attributable to interests owned by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except
for Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, "good and
defensible title" means that the Companys or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, title (as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them (or
purported to be held or owned by them) (1) entitles the Company (or one or
more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of
all Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue
interest share shown in the Company Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons
produced from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and
Gas Properties, (2) obligates the Company (or one or more of its Subsidiaries,
as applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the
maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and
Gas Properties, of not greater than the working interest shown on the Company
Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than any positive
differences in such percentage) and the applicable working interest shown on
the Company Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties that are
accompanied by a proportionate (or greater) net revenue interest in such Oil
and Gas Properties and (3) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances).

 



30 (b) The factual, non-interpretive data supplied by the Company to the Company
Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to the Company interests referred to
in the Company Reserve Report, by or on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve Report
was, as of the time provided, accurate in all material respects. The oil and
gas reserve estimates of the Company set forth in the Company Reserve Report
are derived from reports that have been prepared by the Company Independent
Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all
material respects, the oil and gas reserves of the Company at the dates
indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Except
for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and
production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal
depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters
addressed in the Company Reserve Report that have not had and would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) All proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas
Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being received by such
selling entities in a timely manner and no proceeds from the sale of
Hydrocarbons produced from any such Oil and Gas Properties are being held in
suspense (by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any third party operator
thereof or any other Person or individual) for any reason except as reported
in the Company SEC Documents.

(d) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
rentals, shut-ins and similar payments owed to any Person or individual under
(or otherwise with respect to) any such Oil and Gas Leases have been properly
and timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties
and other Production Burdens with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned
or held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely
and properly paid, and (iii) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(and, to the Companys knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any
provision of, or taken or failed to take any act that, with or without notice,
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of
any Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate
such Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

4.17 _Environmental Matters_.

such Proceeding;

(vi) there have been no Releases of Hazardous Materials at any property
currently or, to the knowledge of the Company, formerly owned, operated or
otherwise used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge
of the Company, by any predecessors of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, which Releases are reasonably likely to result in liability to the
Company under Environmental Law, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice asserting a liability or
obligation under any Environmental Laws with respect to the investigation,
remediation, removal, or monitoring of the Release of any Hazardous Materials
at or from any property currently or formerly owned, operated, or otherwise
used by the Company, or at or from any off-site location where
Hazardous Materials from the Companys operations have been sent for
treatment, disposal storage or handling; and

disclosed by the Company pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Exchange Act (each of the foregoing, a " _Company Related Party
Transaction_ "). The Upstream MLP GP PSA has been duly executed and delivered
by the Company and its Subsidiaries thereto and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries party thereto
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability,
Creditors Rights.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has disclosed to the
Companys auditors and the Company Boards audit committee (A) all known
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report its consolidated financial information and (B)
any known fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has made or permitted to remain outstanding any "extensions of
credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) or
prohibited loans to any executive officer of the Company (as defined in Rule
3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



36 (b) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act). To the knowledge of the Company, such disclosures controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
the Company, including its Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the
Company, including its Subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms.

 

4.25 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is (A) an "investment
company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the
meaning of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 or (B) a "holding company",
a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", an affiliate of a "holding
company", a "public utility" or a "public-utility company" as each such term
is defined in the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.

 

(b) All natural gas pipeline Systems and related facilities owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are (A) "gathering facilities" that are
exempt from regulation by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under
the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and (B) not subject to rate regulation or
comprehensive nondiscriminatory access regulation under the laws of any state
or other local jurisdiction.

4.26 _No Additional Representations_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made in this _Article IV_,
neither the Company nor any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities or conditions
(financial or otherwise) in connection with this Agreement or
the Transactions, and the Company hereby disclaims any such other
representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing
disclaimer, neither the Company nor any other Person makes or has made any
representation or warranty to Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives with respect to (i) any financial projection,
forecast, estimate, budget or prospect information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses; or (ii) except for
the representations and warranties made by the Company in this _Article IV_,
any oral or written information presented to Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives in the course of their due
diligence investigation of the Company, the negotiation of this Agreement or
in the course of the Transactions.

 



37 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company acknowledges and agrees that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person has made or is making any representations or warranties relating to
Parent or its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) whatsoever, express or
implied, beyond those expressly given by Parent and Merger Sub in _Article
V_, including any implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding Parent furnished or made available
to the Company, or any of its Representatives and that the Company has not
relied on any such other representation or warranty not set forth in this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
acknowledges that no representations or warranties are made with respect to
any projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospect information that
may have been made available to the Company or any of its Representatives
(including in certain "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,
the Merger or the other Transactions).

Documents in any risk factor section, any forward-looking disclosure in any
section relating to forward-looking statements or any other statements that

standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is
conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes
such qualification necessary, other than where the failure to be duly
organized, validly existing, or to so qualify or be in good standing has not
had and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent (a " _Parent Material Adverse
Effect_ "). Parent and Merger Sub each has heretofore made available to the
Company complete and correct copies of its Organizational Documents.

 

5.2 _Capital Structure_. As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized

Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of
Parents capital stock necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Merger.

any of their Oil and Gas Properties) under, any provision of (i) the
Organizational Documents of either Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, permit, franchise or license

Material Adverse Effect.

 



40 (c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default or violation (and

Adverse Effect.

authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of all Governmental
Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the
" _Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure to so hold has not had and

status as an officer or director of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. There
is no judgment, settlement, order, decision, direction, writ, injunction,
decree, stipulation or legal or arbitration award of, or promulgated or

Parent Plan required to file a Form 5500 and summary plan description.

reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

(c) There are no actions, suits or claims pending (other than routine claims
for benefits) or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against, or with
respect to, any of the Parent Plans, except for such actions, suits or claims

Title IV of ERISA (including a multiemployer plan within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA), Section 302 of ERISA, or Section 412 of the Code.

 

5.12 _Taxes_. After reasonable diligence, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is aware of the existence of any fact, or has taken or agreed to
take any action, that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent does
not have knowledge of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that
would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



44 5.13 _Oil and Gas Matters_.

 

(a) Except as would not be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect and except for property (i) sold or otherwise disposed of in the
ordinary course of business since the dates of the reserve report prepared by
Wright and Company, Inc. (the " _Parent Independent Petroleum Engineers_ ")
relating to the Parent interests referred to therein as of December 31, 2015
(the " _Parent Reserve Report_ ") or (ii) reflected in the Parent Reserve
Report or in the Parent SEC Reports as having been sold or otherwise disposed
of, as of the date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries have good and
defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis for the
reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Report and in each case as
attributable to interests owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, free and clear
of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the
foregoing sentence, "good and defensible title" means that Parents or one or
more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, title (as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by
them (or purported to be held or owned by them) (1) entitles Parent (or one or
more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all
Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue
interest share shown in the Parent Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced
from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas
Properties, (2) obligates Parent (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance
and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties,
of not greater than the working interest shown on the Parent Reserve Report
for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than any positive differences in such
percentage) and the applicable working interest shown on the Parent Reserve
Report for such Oil and Gas Properties that are accompanied by
a proportionate (or greater) net revenue interest in such Oil and Gas
Properties and (3) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances).

 

(b) The factual, non-interpretive data supplied by Parent to the Parent
Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to the Parent interests referred to
in the Parent Reserve Report, by or on behalf of Parent and its Subsidiaries
that was material to such firms estimates of proved oil and gas reserves
attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent and its Subsidiaries
in connection with the preparation of the Parent Reserve Report was, as of
the time provided, accurate in all material respects. The oil and gas reserve
estimates of Parent set forth in the Parent Reserve Report are derived from
reports that have been prepared by the Parent Independent Petroleum
Engineers, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all material
respects, the oil and gas reserves of Parent at the dates indicated therein
and are in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Except for changes generally
affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry
(including changes in commodity prices) and normal depletion by production,
there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the Parent
Reserve Report that has had or would be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse

unresolved;

(v) there are no Proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened by a Governmental Entity or other third party against

such Proceeding;

(vi) there have been no Releases of Hazardous Materials at any property
currently or, to the knowledge of Parent, formerly owned, operated or

Parent, by any predecessors of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, which

otherwise made available to the Company prior to the date hereof.

(b) Except as expressly set forth in this  _Section 5.14_, neither Parent
nor its Subsidiaries make any representation or warranty regarding compliance
or failure to comply with, or any actual or contingent liability under, any

5.15 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Parent Board has received the opinion
of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC addressed to the Parent Board to the
effect that, as of the date this Agreement was approved by the Parent Board
and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications, and other matters
considered in connection with the preparation of its opinion, the
Exchange Ratio in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to Parent.

5.16 _Brokers_. Except for the fees and expenses payable to Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC, no broker, investment banker, or other Person is
entitled to any brokers, finders or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent.

5.17 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor
any "affiliate" or "associate" (as such terms are used in Section 203 of the

ability to record, process, summarize and report its consolidated financial
information and (B) any known fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Parents
internal controls over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2014, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or permitted to remain
outstanding any "extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) or prohibited loans to any executive officer of Parent

of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Parent has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act). To the knowledge of Parent, such disclosures controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
Parent, including its Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by Parent,
including its Subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Parents principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms.

5.20 _Regulatory Matters_. 

(a) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is (A) an "investment company"
or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of
the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 or (B) a "holding company", a
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company", an affiliate of a "holding
company", a "public utility" or a "public-utility company" as each such term
is defined in the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.

 

(b) All natural gas pipeline Systems and related facilities owned by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries are (A) "gathering facilities" that are exempt from
regulation by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Natural
Gas Act of 1938, and (B) not subject to rate regulation or comprehensive
nondiscriminatory access regulation under the laws of any state or other
local jurisdiction.

5.21 _No Additional Representations_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made in this _Article V_,
neither Parent nor any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities or conditions
(financial or otherwise) in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, and Parent hereby disclaims any such other representations or
warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, neither
Parent nor any other Person makes or has made any representation or warranty
to the Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives with respect to
(i) any financial projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospect
information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses; or (ii) except for the representations and warranties made by
Parent in this _Article V_, any oral or written information presented to the
Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in the course of their due
diligence investigation of Parent, the negotiation of this Agreement or in
the course of the Transactions.

 



48 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company or any other Person
has made or is making any representations or warranties relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those
expressly given by the Company in  _Article IV_, including any implied
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Company furnished or made available to Parent, or
any of its Representatives and that neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied
upon any such representation or warranty. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent acknowledges that no representations or warranties are
made with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets
or prospect information that may have been made available to Parent or any of
its Representatives (including in certain "data rooms," "virtual data rooms,"
management presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or
in connection with, the Merger or the other Transactions).

(i) to the extent applicable, comply with Rule 14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_
, _however_ , that none of the Company, the Company Board or any committee
thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.3(e)(iii)_ or 
_Section 6.3(e)(v)_ effect a Company Change of Recommendation in any
disclosure document or communication filed or publicly issued or made in
conjunction with the compliance with such requirements;

 

(ii) prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders,
engage in the activities prohibited by  _Sections 6.3(b)_ with any Person
who has made a bona fide Competing Proposal that did not result from a
material breach of _Section 6.3_ if (A) prior to engaging in any such
activities, the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Competing Proposal is, or would or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal and that the failure
to engage in such activities would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
duties under applicable Law, and (B) prior to furnishing any non-public
information that is prohibited from being furnished pursuant to _Section
6.3(b)_, the Company receives an executed confidentiality and standstill
agreement from such Person containing terms that are, in the aggregate, no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and otherwise complying with the provisions of this _Section 6.3_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any
information concerning the Company provided to any other Person in connection
with a Competing Proposal that was not previously provided to the Parent;

(iii) prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders,
in response to a bona fide Competing Proposal that did not result from a
material breach of this _Section 6.3_, if the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) so chooses, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ or effect a Company Change of Recommendation, in each
case only after satisfaction of all of the following conditions:

 

(A) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such
Competing Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal and that the failure to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its
duties under applicable Law (taking into account any adjustment to the terms
and conditions of the Merger proposed by Parent in response to such Competing
Proposal);

 



56 (B) the Company shall have given notice (a " _Company Superior
Proposal Notice_ ") to Parent that the Company has received such proposal,
which notice shall include (1) the material terms and conditions of such
proposal, (2) complete copies of any written proposal or offers (including

Company Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into and any other
relevant proposed transaction agreements), (3) the identity of the Person
making such Competing Proposal, and (4) the Companys statement that the
Company intends to take such action at the end of the Negotiation Period;

 

(C) during the Negotiation Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, (1) negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good
faith, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate and so long as Parent and its
Representatives negotiate in good faith, to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Superior Proposal
ceases to constitute a Company Superior Proposal and (2) keep Parent and its
Representatives reasonably informed with respect to the status and changes in
the material terms and conditions of such Competing Proposal or other change
in circumstances related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that each time
material modifications to the financial terms of a Competing Proposal
determined to be a Company Superior Proposal are made the Negotiation Period
shall be extended for 24 hours after Parents receipt of written notification
of such modifications; and

(D) the Company Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms of
this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent and, at the end of the
Negotiation Period, shall have determined in good faith that (1) such
Competing Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal even
if such revisions were to be given effect and (2) the failure to effect a
Company Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable Law;

 

(iv) prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders,
seek clarification from (but not engage in negotiations with or provide non-
public information to) any Person that has made a Competing Proposal solely to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such proposal to provide
adequate information for the Company Board or any committee thereof to make
an informed determination under _Section 6.3(e)(ii)_; and

 



57 (v) prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, in
response to a Company Intervening Event, if the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) so chooses, cause the Company to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation, in each case only after satisfaction of all of the following
conditions:

failure to effect the Company Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent
with its duties under applicable Law;

Notice_ "), which notice shall include (1) a description of the reasons for
the Company Change of Recommendation and (2) the Companys statement that the

(C) during the Negotiation Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good
faith, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate and so long as Parent and its
Representatives negotiate in good faith, to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need
to effect a Company Change of Recommendation; and

(D) the Company Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms of
this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent and, at the end of the
Negotiation Period, shall have determined in good faith that such Company
Intervening Event remains in effect and the failure to effect the Company
Change of Recommendation in response to such Company Intervening Event would
be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, even if such revisions
were to be given effect.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
may inform any Person of the existence of the provisions of this  _Section
6.3_.

(g) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to inform all
Representatives of such Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates of the
restrictions described in this _Section 6.3_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.3_, any action, or failure to take action, that
is taken by a Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates that, if taken by the Company would have been a breach of this
_Section 6.3_, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.3_ by the
Company.

 

6.4 _Parent Change in Recommendation_. Except as specifically permitted in
this _Section 6.4_, Parent may not make a Parent Change of Recommendation.
Prior to the obtaining of the Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board
(or any committee thereof) may make a Parent Change of Recommendation in
response to a Parent Intervening Event if the Parent Board shall
have reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Parent
Board to make such Parent Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with
the Parent Boards duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Parent Board (or any committee thereof) shall not make a Parent

 



58  Change of Recommendation, unless prior to taking such action, (A) Parent has
given the Company prior written notice informing the Company that Parent
intends to make such Parent Change of Recommendation at the end of the
Negotiation Period and a description of the reasons for the Parent Change of
Recommendation (such notice being referred to herein as a " _Parent Change of
Recommendation Notice_ "); (B) during the Negotiation Period, Parent shall
have negotiated in good faith, and shall have caused its Representatives to
negotiate in good faith, with the Company and its Representatives, to the
extent the Company wishes to negotiate and so long as the Company and its
Representatives negotiate in good faith, to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need
for making such Parent Change of Recommendation; and (C) following the end
of such Negotiation Period, the Parent Board shall have considered all
revisions to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by the
Company and, at the end of the Negotiation Period, and shall have determined
in good faith that such Parent Intervening Event remains in effect and the
failure to make such Parent Change of Recommendation in response to such
Parent Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Parent Boards duties
under applicable Law.

 

6.5 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration Statement_.

 

(a) Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and information
relating to it and Merger Sub as the Company may reasonably request for the
purpose of including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement
and any amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the

and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger. All correspondence and communications to the SEC made
by the Company or Parent with respect to the Transactions will be provided to
the other party with an opportunity to review and comment thereon, prior to
such communication or correspondence being made to the SEC.

the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act

time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension
of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto

 



59  or requests by the SEC for additional information. No amendment or
supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement shall be
filed without the approval of the parties, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect
to documents filed by a party that are incorporated by reference in the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, this right of approval shall
apply only with respect to information relating to the other party and its
Affiliates, their business, financial condition or results of operations or
the transactions contemplated hereby; and _provided further_ that the
Company, in connection with any Company Change of Recommendation, may amend
or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by

of Recommendation, and in such event, this right of approval shall apply only
with respect to information relating to Parent and its Affiliates or their
business, financial condition or results of operations.

 

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 

6.6 _Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining

give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholder Meeting in accordance
with this  _Section 6.6(b)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by

Alternative Proposal or by any Parent Change of Recommendation. Except as

Parent Board, recommend, including through a recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement, that the stockholders of Parent vote in favor of the Parent Stock

the other party and its officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, agents, legal counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ "), during the period
prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.1_ of this Agreement,
reasonable access, at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the
officers, key employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of
such party and its Subsidiaries and to their books, records, contracts and
documents and shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish
reasonably promptly to the other party and its Representatives such
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties,
contracts, records and personnel as may be reasonably requested, from time to
time, by or on behalf of the other party. Each party and its Representatives
shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the other party or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt
and timely discharge by the employees of the other party and its Subsidiaries
of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 6.7(a)_, each party shall not be required to, or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to the other party or any
of its Representatives to the extent that such information is subject to
attorney-client privilege or the attorney work-product doctrine or that such
access or the furnishing of such information is prohibited by applicable Law
or an existing contract or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
party shall not have access to personnel records of the other party or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records,
medical histories or other information that in the other partys good faith
opinion the disclosure of which could subject the other party or any of its
Subsidiaries to risk of liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party
shall not be permitted to conduct any sampling or analysis of any
environmental media or building materials at any facility of the other party
or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the other party,
which may be granted or withheld in the other partys sole discretion. Each
party agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use
any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.7(a)_ for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions.

 

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of February 16, 2016 between Parent
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all information
furnished thereunder or hereunder. All information provided to any party or
its Representatives pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is
deemed to be "Evaluation Material" as defined under the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



62 6.8 _HSR and Other Approvals_.

 

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to Antitrust Laws
to which _Sections 6.8(b)_ and _(c)_ , and not this  _Section 6.8(a)_, shall
apply, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the parties shall
proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Entities all
authorizations, consents, notifications, certifications, registrations,
declarations and filings that are necessary in order to consummate the
Transactions and shall diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall
cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of, such matters.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than 15 Business Days following the date of
this Agreement, the parties shall make any filings required under the HSR Act.
As promptly as reasonably practicable, parties shall make such filings and
notifications as may be required by foreign competition laws and merger
regulations (the " _Competition Law Notifications_ "). Each of Parent and the
Company shall cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish to the other
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings under
any applicable Antitrust Laws. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and the Company
shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt expiration of
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any Competition Law
Notifications. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to respond to and comply with any request for information from any
Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying, administering, or
investigating the HSR Act, any Competition Law Notifications or any other Law
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of mergers, monopolization, restraining trade or abusing a dominant position
(collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "), including the Federal Trade Commission,
the Department of Justice, any attorney general of any state of the United
States, the European Commission or any other competition authority of any
jurisdiction (" _Antitrust Authority_ "). Parent and the Company shall keep
each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from any Antitrust Authority.
Parent shall take any and all action necessary, including but not limited to
(i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to
sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of
the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating
existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or
other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (v)
effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or
stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications
with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and in
the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
its or their businesses or assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation
of the Merger) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure that no
Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling,

 



63  injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any Law or other
action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority with the
authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the
Merger, fails to do so by the End Date. In the event that any action is
threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust
Law, the Company and Parent shall take such action, including any Divestiture
Action, as may be necessary to avoid, resist or resolve such action. Parent
shall be entitled to direct any Proceedings with any Antitrust Authority or
other Person relating to any of the foregoing, _provided_ , _however_ , that
it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein.
In addition, in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or
other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any
Proceeding that would make consummation of the Transactions in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions,
Parent shall take promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or
suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to
the End Date. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information
protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this
section so as to preserve any applicable doctrine or
privilege. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none
of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any Divestiture Action that would have, or that would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not take any action that would
hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required
waiting period under the HSR Act, any Competition Law Notifications or any
other applicable Antitrust Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may
take any reasonable action to resist or reduce the scope of a Divestiture
Action, even if it delays such expiration to a later date (except that such
date may not be beyond the End Date).

 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one year beginning on the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
each individual who is employed as of the Closing Date by the Company or a
Subsidiary thereof (a " _Company Employee_ ") and who remains employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries) to be provided with base compensation (salary and wages)
and annual incentive compensation opportunities at a rate no less favorable,
with respect to each individual receiving any such compensation, than that
received by similarly-situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Parent shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to permit each
Company Employee to either continue to participate from and after the Closing
Date in the Company Plans or be eligible to participate from and after the
Closing Date in Employee Benefit Plans of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), subject to
the terms and conditions thereof and the remainder of this _Section 6.9(b)_.
To the extent Parent causes a Company Employee to cease to be eligible to
participate in a Company Plan and instead provides for such Company Employee
to be eligible to participate

 



64  in an Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by a Parent or one of
its Subsidiaries (the " _Replacement Plans_ "), if such Replacement Plan is a
group health plan, Parent shall credit (or cause to be credited) such Company
Employee, for the year during which such coverage under such Replacement Plan
begins, with any deductibles and copayments already incurred during such year
under the comparable Company Plan. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, their
Affiliates, and the Replacement Plans shall recognize each Company Employees
years of service and level of seniority with the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including service and seniority with any other employer that was recognized
by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof) for purposes of terms of employment
and eligibility, vesting and benefit determination (but not for benefit
accruals under any defined benefit or retiree welfare arrangement) under the
Replacement Plans. Parent shall cause each Replacement Plan to waive any
preexisting condition exclusion or restriction with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to a Company Employee to the extent such
exclusion or restriction did not apply with respect to such employee under
the corresponding Company Plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor their respective obligations under
all employment, severance, change in control and other agreements, if any,
between the Company (or a Subsidiary thereof) and an individual employed
prior to the Closing Date by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof, but subject
to any provisions thereof related to termination or amendment of such
agreements.

 

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
assume, adopt and continue the Memorial Resource Development Corp. 401(k)
Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_ ") as in existence immediately prior to the Closing
Date. The Surviving Corporation shall become the sponsor of the 401(k) Plan
and shall assume all of the powers, authorities, duties,
responsibilities, and obligations thereunder to the extent indicated in the
401(k) Plan. The Surviving Corporation shall execute such documents as may be
appropriate to further the purposes of the assignment and assumption and to
accomplish and complete such assignment and assumption.

(e) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Company Employee is entitled during the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent or its applicable Affiliate will
assume and honor all vacation and other paid time off days accrued or earned
but not yet taken by such Company Employee as of the Closing Date.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be
construed as amending, any benefit plan, program or agreement sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are for the sole benefit
of the parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee or other current or former employee
of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates), other than the parties
and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable
or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided
for in this _Section 6.9_) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to continue the employment of any
Company Employee or any other Person.

 



65 6.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect
on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Effective Time and until the six
year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any
Company Plan or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ")
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses
(including attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses), liabilities
or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of or incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified
Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in
whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that
such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Company Plan or any of its
Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan,
trust or other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such
Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission
occurring or existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (" _Indemnified
Liabilities_ "), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in
part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this
Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly
and severally, pay expenses incurred in connection therewith in advance of the
final disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding is brought or threatened to be
brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may retain the
Companys regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to
them, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as
statements therefor are received, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall use its best efforts to assist in the defense of any such
matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or advancement
of expenses under this _Section 6.10_, upon learning of any such Proceeding,
shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not
relieve a party from any obligations that it may have under this _Section
6.10_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such partys
position with respect to such claims). With respect to any determination of
whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification by Parent or
Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.10_, such Indemnified Person
shall have the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to require that such
determination be made by special, independent legal counsel selected by the
Indemnified Person and approved by Parent or Surviving Corporation,
as applicable (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
and who has not otherwise performed material services for Parent, Surviving
Corporation or the Indemnified Person within the last three (3) years.

 



66 (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation in any manner that would affect (or manage the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would)
adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by
applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its
directors, officers or employees existing immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified
Person against all reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), such amounts to be
payable in advance upon request as provided in _Section 6.10(a)_, relating to
the enforcement of such Indemnified Persons rights under this _Section
6.10_ or under any charter, bylaw or contract regardless of whether such
Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification
hereunder or thereunder.

 

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place, and
Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time, "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Companys existing director and officer liability policies disclosed on
_Schedule 4.19_ of the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to
matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may elect in its sole discretion
to, but shall not be required to, spend more than 300% (the " _Cap Amount_ ")
of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof for
the six years of coverage under such tail policy; _provided further_ that if
the cost of such insurance exceeds the Cap Amount, and Parent elects not to
spend more than the Cap Amount for such purpose, then Parent shall purchase
as much coverage as is obtainable for the Cap Amount.

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.10_.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties and each Person entitled to
indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this
_Section 6.10_, and his heirs and representatives. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any
of their assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render Parent
or Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy their obligations under this 
_Section 6.10_.

 



67 6.11 _Agreement to Defend; Stockholder Litigation_. In the event any
Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced that
questions the validity or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in
connection therewith, the parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to defend against and respond thereto.

6.12 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by the parties. The parties will not, and each of the foregoing
will cause its Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make
other public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, without the prior written approval of the parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party or its Representatives may issue a
public announcement or other public disclosures required by applicable Law or
the rules of any stock exchange upon which such partys capital stock is
traded, provided such party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the other
party an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure
and provide reasonable comment regarding same; _provided_ _further_ that no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict in any manner the
Companys ability to communicate with its employees and that the Company shall
not be required by any provision of this Agreement to consult with or obtain
any approval from any other party with respect to a public announcement or
press release issued in connection with the receipt and existence of a
Competing Proposal and matters related thereto or a Company Change of
Recommendation other than as set forth in _Section 6.3_; _provided_ _further_
that no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict in any manner
Parents ability to communicate with its employees and that Parent shall not
be required by any provision of this Agreement to consult with or obtain any
approval from any other party with respect to a public announcement or press
release issued in connection the receipt and existence of an Alternative
Proposal and matters related thereto or with a Parent Change of Recommendation
other than as set forth in _Section 6.4_.

 

6.13 _Advice of Certain Matters; Control of Business_. Subject to compliance
with applicable Law, the Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall confer
on a regular basis with each other, report on operational matters and shall
promptly advise each other orally and in writing of any change or event
having, or which would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be. Except with respect to Antitrust Laws as provided
in _Section 5.4_, the Company and Parent shall promptly provide each other
(or their respective counsel) copies of all filings made by such party or its
Subsidiaries with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions. Without limiting in any way any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give any party, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the other party and their respective Subsidiaries operations prior
to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the parties shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.14 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company and Parent will (a) cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which
become payable in connection with the Transactions, (b) cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all applications or other documents
regarding any applicable exemptions to any such Tax or fee, and (c) each pay
any such Tax or fee which becomes payable by it on or before the due date
therefor.

 



68 6.15 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

 

(a) Except to the extent that the parties obligations are specifically set
forth elsewhere in this _Article VI_, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement (including _Section 6.3_), each of the
parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and
the other Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, neither a Company Change
of Recommendation nor a Parent Change of Recommendation, in either case
effected in accordance with this Agreement, shall constitute a breach of this
_Section 6.15(a)_.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Merger Sub
shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon becoming aware of (i) any
condition, event or circumstance that will result in any of the conditions in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.3(a)_ not being met, or (ii) the failure by such party
to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

6.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of Parent (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act.

6.17 _Listing Application_. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause
the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing
on the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, subject to official notice of
issuance.

 

6.18 _Tax Treatment_. Each of Parent and the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not take, and will use
its reasonable best efforts to prevent any Affiliate of such party from
taking, any actions that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger
from qualifying, as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company will cooperate with one another
and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinions of counsel
referred to in _Sections 7.2(d)_ and _7.3(d)_ and in connection therewith,
each shall deliver to such counsel duly executed Parent tax certificate
containing such representations, warranties and covenants as shall be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable the counsel referred to in
_Section 7.2(d)_ to render the opinions described in such section (" _Parent
Tax Certificate_ ") and a duly executed Company tax certificate containing
such representations, warranties and covenants as shall be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to 

 



69  enable the counsel referred to in _Section 7.3(d)_ to render the opinions
described in such section (" _Company Tax Certificate_ "), respectively dated
as of the Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as of the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC), and provide such
other information as reasonably requested by counsel for purposes of rendering
such opinions.

 

6.19 _Takeover Laws_. None of the parties will take any action that would
cause the Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover
Laws, and each of them will take all reasonable steps within its control to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Transactions from the
Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the
Transactions. 

6.20 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement.

6.21 _Debt Offers_.

 

(a) If, prior to the Closing Date, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries decides
to commence a tender offer and/or consent solicitation in respect of some or
all of the outstanding Company Senior Notes reasonably necessary or
appropriate to facilitate the Transactions (each, a " _Debt Offer_ "), Parent
shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection
with such Debt Offers, including the offers to purchase and consent
solicitation statements, letters of transmittal and other related documents
(collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to
provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the preparation of the
Offer Documents and the consummation of such Debt Offers (which are to be
consummated at the Effective Time) including with respect to the Companys
execution of supplemental indentures (either at the Effective Time or, if
earlier, conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time) reflecting
amendments to the indenture governing the Company Senior Notes taking effect
as of the Effective Time, to the extent approved by any required consents of
holders of the Company Senior Notes. All mailings to the holders of the
Company Senior Notes in connection with the Debt Offers shall be subject to
the prior review and comment by the Company and Parent and shall be reasonably
acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of any Debt
Offer any information in the applicable Offer Documents should be discovered
by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Offer Documents, so that such Offer Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be disseminated by Parent to the holders of
the Company Senior Notes. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable
Law conflict with this  _Section 6.21_, Parent and the Company shall comply
with the applicable Law and shall not be deemed to have breached their
obligations under this Agreement by such compliance. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that neither the pendency nor the consummation of any
such Debt Offer is a condition to Parents or Merger Subs obligations under
this Agreement.

 



70 (b) If requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries commencing or closing a Debt Offer for the Company Senior Notes,
the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the indenture governing the
Company Senior Notes, take any actions reasonably requested by Parent to
facilitate the redemption, satisfaction and/or discharge of the Company
Senior Notes pursuant to such indenture at the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to the Company being required to issue any irrevocable
notice of redemption with respect to the Company Senior Notes, which
redemption cannot be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing, Parent
shall have, or shall have caused to be, deposited with the trustee under such
indenture sufficient funds to effect such redemption, satisfaction and
discharge. If a conditional notice is given, Parent shall ensure that at the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation has all funds necessary in connection
with any such redemption or satisfaction and discharge. It shall not be a
default under this Agreement or a failure of any condition to closing under
_Section 7.3_ if the Company, immediately prior to closing, does not have
such funds necessary in connection with any such redemption or satisfaction
and discharge. Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the pendency nor
the consummation of any such redemption, defeasance or satisfaction and
discharge is a condition to Parents obligations under this Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any action pursuant to  _clause
(a)_ or _(b)_ above if such action would result in a default, breach or loss
of benefit (whether with notice, lapse of time or otherwise) under any loan
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, credit agreement or other
contract or agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which it or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective
properties or assets are bound. To the extent that any action required to be
taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to _clause (a)_ or
_(b)_ above would result in any such default, breach or loss of benefit, the
parties instead will use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate, including
by keeping each other informed, to obtain on a timely basis any consents or
waivers to such actions, from the parties necessary to grant such consents or
waivers, sufficient to permit the Company to take such actions without giving
rise to such default, breach or loss of benefit; _provided_ the Company will
pay such fees or other amounts as necessary to obtain such consents or waivers
if and only if Parent agrees in advance to the amount of such fees or other
amounts; and _provided_   _further_ that the Companys obligation to use
reasonable best efforts shall not include (x) any obligation to pay any fee or
other amount to such parties to which Parent has not agreed in advance or (y)
any obligation to enter into any amendment, modification or waiver to any
such applicable loan agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, credit
agreement or contract or other agreement that imposes any additional
obligation on, or results in the loss of any right or benefit of, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. All reasonable fees
and expenses (and all other fees and expenses consented to by Parent,
including, if so approved, all fees and other amounts referenced in
the second sentence of this paragraph), incurred by the Company in connection
with the activities set forth in this _Section 6.21_ shall be paid by Parent
directly. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives for and against any
and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the Debt Offer and any information contained in the
Offer Documents in connection therewith, except (i) with respect to
information supplied by the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
any Offering Document or (ii) to the extent such losses and 

 



71  damages arise from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives. All Transfer Taxes
incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid when due by Parent
or its Affiliates or, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation.

and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, except for the liability of Parent
in the case of intentional fraud or an intentional and material breach of a
covenant, agreement or obligation; and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub against the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or

9.4 _Rules of Construction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel
of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of
this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice of said
independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the parties shall be deemed
the work product of the parties and may not be construed against any party by
reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision
that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement
against any party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly
waived.

 

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that
such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that such items are material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be, or that such items have
resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Parent
Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure Letter are inserted for convenience
only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are
arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement merely
for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company
Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, as an exception
to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately
disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations
or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such
representations or warranties is reasonably apparent from such item,
notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter with respect to such
other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto.

 



80 (c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor
shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to
determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(d) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles,
Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the
corresponding Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other
subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles
appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other
subdivisions of this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute
any part of such Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and
shall be disregarded in construing the language contained therein. The words
"this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof" and words of
similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words "this Section,"
"this subsection" and words of similar import, refer only to the Sections or
subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word "including" (in its
various forms) means "including, without limitation." Pronouns in
masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include
any other gender and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein)
in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa,
unless the context otherwise expressly requires. Unless the context otherwise
requires, all defined terms contained herein shall include the singular and
plural and the conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such defined terms. Unless

contract, statute or regulation are to the agreement, contract, statute or
regulation as amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time
to time (in the case of an agreement or contract, to the extent permitted by
the terms thereof and, if applicable, by the terms of this Agreement); (ii)
any Governmental Entity include any successor to that Governmental Entity;
(iii) any applicable Law refers to such applicable Law as amended, modified,
supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of statutes,
include any rules and regulations promulgated under such statute) and

successor to such section; and (iv) days mean calendar days.

9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, including via facsimile or email in "portable document format"
(".pdf") form transmission, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 



81 9.6 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (together
with the Confidentiality Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and any
other documents and instruments executed pursuant hereto) constitutes the
entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. Except for the provisions of _Article III_ (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the rights of the former holders of Company Common Stock
to receive the Merger Consideration) and  _Sections 6.9_ and _6.10_ (which
from and after the Effective Time are intended for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Persons referred to therein and by their respective
heirs and representatives), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of Parents or Merger
Subs intentional and material breach of this Agreement or intentional fraud
as a result of which damages would be payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(j)_,
then the Companys stockholders, acting solely through the Company, shall be
beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall be entitled to pursue any and all
legally available remedies, including equitable relief, and to seek recovery
of all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses of every kind and
nature, including reasonable attorneys fees; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the rights granted pursuant to this sentence shall be enforceable only by the
Company, on behalf of the Company stockholders, in the Companys sole
discretion, it being understood and agreed such rights shall attach to such
shares of Company Stock and subsequently trade and transfer therewith and,
consequently, any damages, settlements, or other amounts recovered or received
by the Company with respect to such rights may, in the Companys sole
discretion, be (a) distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock of record as of any date determined
by the Company or (b) retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the
Company on behalf of its stockholders in any manner the Company deems fit.

THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED EXCLUSIVELY BY SUCH A
DELAWARE STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO AND GRANT ANY
SUCH COURT JURISDICTION OVER THE PERSON OF SUCH PARTIES AND OVER THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF SUCH DISPUTE AND AGREE THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN

_SECTION 8.3_ OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY LAW SHALL BE
VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

9.8 _Severability_. Each party agrees that, should any court or other
competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or part hereof to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such other term or
provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, in response to an order from a court or other
competent authority for any party to take any action inconsistent herewith or
not to take an action consistent herewith or required hereby, to the extent
that a party hereto took an action inconsistent with this Agreement or failed
to take action consistent with this Agreement or required by this Agreement
pursuant to such order, such party shall not incur any liability or obligation
unless such party did not in good faith seek to resist or object to the
imposition or entering of such order.

 



83 9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in
violation of this _Section 9.9_ shall be void.

 

9.10 _Affiliate Liability_. Each of the following is herein referred to as a "
_Company Affiliate_ ") (a) any direct or indirect holder of equity interests
or securities in the Company (whether limited or general partners, members,
stockholders or otherwise), and (b) any director, officer, employee,
representative or agent of (i) the Company or (ii) any Person who controls
the Company. Except as expressly contemplated by the Voting Agreement, no
Company Affiliate shall have any liability or obligation to Parent or Merger
Sub of any nature whatsoever in connection with or under this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and Parent and Merger Sub
hereby waive and release all claims of any such liability and obligation.

 

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage, for
which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the
parties. Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1_, it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
competent jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this _Section 9.11_,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
the terms of this Agreement at law or in equity. Each party accordingly
agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy
of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such
party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section
9.11_. Each party further agrees that no other party or any other Person shall
be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument
in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in
this _Section 9.11_, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have
to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. 

9.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at any time
before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company,
but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by law would
require the further approval by such stockholders without first obtaining
such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

 



84 9.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and Parent may, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, to the extent legally allowed:

(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
the other party hereunder;

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
party contained herein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or
Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party.
