Net Working Capital or (ii) increased by the amount, Dollar for Dollar, by
which the Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Preliminary Net
Working Capital.

 



 

(b) Without duplication of any adjustment made pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_,
the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be further (i) reduced by the amount,
Dollar for Dollar, by which the Closing Net Cash Amount is less than the
Preliminary Net Cash Amount or (ii) increased by the amount, Dollar for
Dollar, by which the Closing Net Cash Amount is greater than the Preliminary
Net Cash Amount.

 



 

(c) Without duplication of any adjustment made pursuant to _Sections 2.6(a)_
or _2.6(b)_ , the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be further (i) increased by
the amount, Dollar for Dollar, by which the Preliminary Company Transaction
Expenses are greater than the Closing Company Transaction Expenses or (ii)
decreased by the amount, Dollar for Dollar, by which the Preliminary Company
Transaction Expenses are less than the Closing Company Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(d) Without duplication of any adjustment made pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_,
_2.6(b)_ or _2.6(c)_ the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be further (i)
increased by the amount, Dollar for Dollar, by which the Preliminary Company
Indebtedness is greater than the Closing Company Indebtedness or (ii)
decreased by the amount, Dollar for Dollar, by which the Preliminary Company

(e) The net amount of all sums that are an increase or decrease to the

2.6(b)_, _Section 2.6(c)_, and _Section 2.6(d)_ as finally determined

Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail its good faith calculation of
(i) the Closing Net Working Capital, (ii) the Closing Net Cash Amount, (iii)
the Closing Company Transaction Expenses, (iv) the Closing Company
Indebtedness, and (v) the Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment Statement shall be
prepared using the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and
policies used in the preparation of the Preliminary Statement, including the
methodologies used in calculating any specifically noted adjustments set forth
on the Preliminary Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) After receipt of the Adjustment Statement, the Representative shall have
forty-five days to review the Adjustment Statement together with the
workpapers used in its preparation. The Adjustment Statement shall become
final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties upon the first to occur of (i)
the Representative consenting to such Adjustment Statement or (ii) forty-five
days following receipt thereof by the Representative unless the Representative
gives written notice of its disagreement (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to
the Buyer prior to such date. The Buyer shall give the Representative, the
Sellers and their authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours of the Company, to all personnel, books and records of the
Company and all work papers of the Company prepared in connection with the
Adjustment Statement, as reasonably requested by the Representative to assist
in the preparation of the Notice of Disagreement. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement
so asserted and, as applicable, the Representatives calculation of (1) the
Closing Net Working Capital, (2) the Closing Net Cash Amount, (3) the Closing
Company Transaction Expenses, (4) the Closing Company Indebtedness, and (5)
the Adjustment Amount. During the twenty days immediately following the
receipt by the Buyer of the Notice of Disagreement, the authorized
representatives of the Buyer and the Representative shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any issues properly included in the Notice of Disagreement.
During such period, the Buyer shall have full access to the work papers of the
Representative prepared in connection with the Representatives preparation of
the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such twenty day period, at the
request of any Party, any and all matters which remain in dispute and which
were included in the Notice of Disagreement shall be submitted to KPMG LLP
(the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for binding resolution. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, in the proportion that the aggregate Dollar amount
of items submitted to the Accounting Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed by
the Buyer and the Representative, as applicable, bears to the aggregate Dollar
amount of all items submitted to the Accounting Firm. In the event that the
Representative delivers a Notice of Disagreement to the Buyer within the
foregoing forty-five day period, then the Adjustment Statement (as revised to
reflect resolution) shall become final, conclusive and binding upon the
Parties on the date such Parties resolve in writing all differences they have
with respect to any matter included in the Notice of Disagreement pursuant to
the dispute resolution procedures set forth herein or by mutual agreement of
the Parties.

 



 

(h) The Accounting Firm shall determine and report in writing to the Buyer and
Representative as to the resolution of all disputed matters submitted to the
Accounting Firm and the effect of such determinations on the Adjustment
Statement within ten Business Days after such submission or such longer period
as the Accounting Firm may reasonably require, and such determinations shall
be final, conclusive and binding as to the Parties. In resolving any disputed
item, the Accounting Firm, acting in the capacity of an expert and not as an
arbitrator: (i) shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth in
the Notice of Disagreement delivered pursuant to _Section 2.6(g)_ as a
disputed item (other than matters thereafter resolved by mutual written
agreement of the Buyer and the Representative), (ii) shall further limit its
review to whether the calculation of any such disputed item is mathematically
accurate and has been prepared using the same principles, practices,
methodologies and policies used in preparation of the Preliminary Statement,
and (iii) shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by any Party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by any other Party in the Adjustment Statement or in the Notice
of Disagreement delivered pursuant

 



      
 

 



 

to _Section 2.6(g)_. The Buyer and the Representative shall each furnish to
the Accounting Firm such workpapers and other documents and information
relating to the disputed issues, and shall provide interviews and answer
questions, as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request in connection with
its determination of such disputed items.

 



 

(i) The Preliminary Purchase Price as adjusted by the Adjustment Amount, if at
all, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6_, shall be referred
to herein as the " _Final Purchase Price_."

 



 

(j) If, upon determination of the Adjustment Amount, the Final Purchase Price
is greater than the Preliminary Purchase Price, then:

 



 

(i) the Buyer and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to release
to the Sellers (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share) an amount
equal to the product of the Sellers Part _times_ the Adjustment Escrow
Amount from the Sellers Escrow Account;

 



 

(ii) the Company and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to
release to the Phantom Holders an amount equal to the product of the Phantom
Part _times_ the Adjustment Escrow Amount from the Phantom Escrow Account;

 



 

(iii) the Company shall pay to the Phantom Holders the incremental amount in
cash in respect of the Phantom Units, determined on a basis consistent with
the methodology for calculating Closing Company Transaction Expenses; and

 



 

(iv) the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers (in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Shares) an amount in cash equal to the Adjustment Amount;

 



 

(k) If, upon determination of the Adjustment Amount, the Final Purchase Price
is less than the Preliminary Purchase Price, then:

 



 

(i) the Buyer and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to release
to the Buyer from the Seller Escrow Account an amount equal to the Adjustment
Amount;

 



 

(ii) the Company and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to
release to the Company from the Phantom Escrow Account an amount equal to the
incremental reduction in the amount payable in respect of the Phantom Units,
determined on a basis consistent with the methodology for calculating Closing
Company Transaction Expenses; provided, that;

 



 

(1) if the Adjustment Amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount, each Seller
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent for deposit into the Sellers Escrow Account
such Sellers Pro Rata Share of the Sellers Part of such excess, and the
Phantom Holders shall deliver to the Escrow Agent for deposit into the Phantom
Escrow Account the Phantom Part of such excess (determined on a basis
consistent with the methodology for calculating Closing Company Transaction
Expense); or

 



      
 

 



 

(2) if the Adjustment Amount is less than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, the
Buyer and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to release to the
Sellers (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) an amount equal
to the product of the Sellers Part _times_ the remaining balance of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, and the Company and the Representative shall cause
the Escrow Agent to release to the Phantom Holders an amount equal to the
product of the Phantom Part _times_ the remaining balance of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount.

 



 

(l) If the Preliminary Purchase Price equals the Final Purchase Price, then
the Buyer and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to release to
the Sellers (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) an amount
equal to the product of the Sellers Part times the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
and the Company and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to release
to the Phantom Holders an amount equal to the product of the Phantom Part
_times_ the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

 



 

(m) All payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ shall be made (and, with
respect to amounts to be released by the Escrow Agent, the Buyer, the Company,
and the Representative shall take all commercially reasonable action to cause
the Escrow Agent to release the required amounts) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five Business Days following determination
of the Final Purchase Price.

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 3.16(h)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the

increase any Liability under any Company Plan; and no amount paid or payable
(whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in

3.16(j)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. No Title IV Plan has failed to meet the
minimum funding standard (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section

Action will be instituted. No "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043
of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any Title IV Plan, nor has notice of
any such event been required to be filed for any Title IV Plan, in any case

would not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Buyer to
consummate timely the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution,

contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or other action on the part of the Buyer. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Buyer and upon execution and delivery

delivered by the Company. Assuming that this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents are valid and binding obligations of the Company and the
Sellers, this Agreement, and upon execution and delivery, the other
Transaction Documents, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Buyer, enforceable against the Buyer in accordance with their terms,
subject to the Remedies Exception.

Agreement by the Buyer, nor the consummation by the Buyer of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (a) violate any provision of the charter documents of

including payment of the aggregate Preliminary Purchase Price, the Final

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any financing or refinancing
of indebtedness of the Company in connection therewith. The Buyer acknowledges
that the availability of funding is not a condition precedent (under _Section
7.3_ or otherwise) to its

 



      
 

 



 

obligations to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Buyer has delivered to Seller true, correct and complete signed counterparts
of the commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Commitment

Letters shall in no way alter the representation of Buyer set forth in this

are no outstanding injunctions, judgments, orders, decrees, rulings, or

consummate timely the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.7. _Brokers  Fees_. Except as set forth in _Section 5.7_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, which sets forth the fees that shall be paid by the Buyer
(or by the Company following the Closing), neither the Buyer nor any of its

oral, express or implied) with any Person which may result in the obligation
of any Seller or the Company prior to Closing to pay any fees, commissions or
expenses to any broker or finder as a result of the execution and delivery of

Shares to be acquired by the Buyer hereunder solely for investment and not
with a view toward, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof

in the Shares acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement and can afford a
complete loss of such investment.

 



 

Section 5.10. _No Knowledge of Misrepresentations or Omissions_. As of the
date hereof, to the Buyers Knowledge, no facts or matters exist that would
(a) serve as the basis for a claim by the Buyer against the Sellers based upon
a breach of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Agreement or (b) give the Buyer the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_.

to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or if any Action is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any Governmental Authority or
any other Person challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve any such objections or challenges so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including assenting to or
agreeing to settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other

businesses of the Company, the Buyer or their respective Subsidiaries in
existence as of the date hereof. In the event that any Injunction is entered
or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any Action that would make

otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer and the Company shall take promptly
any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such Injunction so as
to permit such consummation prior to the Drop Dead Date. With regard to any

including preparing and delivering any accounting or other statement provided
for under this Agreement, preparing Tax Returns or responding to or disputing
any Tax audit; _provided_ , _however_ , that access to such books, records,
Tax Returns, documents and employees will not interfere with the normal
operations of the Company and the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
Company incurred in connection therewith will be paid by the Sellers. The
Buyer will cause the Company to maintain and preserve all such Tax Returns,
books, records and other documents for the greater of (A) seven years after
the Closing Date or (B) any applicable statutory or regulatory retention
period, as the same may be extended and, in each case, shall offer to transfer
such records to the Sellers at the Sellers own cost and expense at the end of
any such period by providing the Sellers with not less than twenty days

Buyer to exercise its right to obtain such records within that twenty-day
period.

 



 

Section 6.10. _Further Assurances_. The Company, the Sellers and the Buyer
each agree that from time to time after the Closing Date, they will execute
and deliver or cause their respective Affiliates (including, with respect to
the Buyer, the Company) to execute and deliver such further instruments, and
take (or cause their respective Affiliates, including, with respect to the
Buyer, the Company, to take) such other action, as may be reasonably necessary
to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement and the other

(a) For six years from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
by the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect,
and applicable Law, the Buyer shall cause the Company to indemnify and hold
harmless the officers and directors of the Company who held any such position
at any time on or prior to the Closing (collectively, " _Indemnified
Officers/Directors_ ") in respect of acts or omissions (other than illegal
acts or acts of fraud) occurring prior to the Closing, and the Buyer shall
cause the Company to maintain, for six years from and after the Closing,
indemnification provisions in its organizational documents that are no less
favorable to the Indemnified Officers/Directors than those in effect with
respect to the Company immediately prior to the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no indemnification shall be made to any Indemnified
Officers/Directors to the extent it is finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Officer/Director did not, with
respect to the matter subject to indemnification hereunder act in good faith
and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Company. Without limiting the foregoing and in
connection therewith, the Company shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Company
to, periodically advance or reimburse each Indemnified Officer/Director for
all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel as such fees and expenses are
incurred in accordance with the Companys articles of incorporation and
bylaws, as currently in effect, and applicable Law; _provided_ that such
Indemnified Officer/Director shall agree to repay the amount of such
reimbursement if it shall be judicially determined by judgment or order not
subject to further appeal that such Indemnified Officer/Director is not
entitled to indemnification in connection with such matter. The Buyer shall
cause to be obtained and maintained in effect, for a period of six years after
the Closing, policies of directors and officers liability insurance with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier protecting the Indemnified Officers/Directors with
coverages and containing terms and conditions (including with respect to
deductible, amount and payment of attorneys fees) that are no less favorable
than those set forth in the term sheet providing $15 million of liability
coverage, dated June 6, 2013, from National Union Fire Insurance Company of
Pittsburgh, Pa., provided to Buyer prior to the date hereof. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties
agrees that from and after the Closing Date each Indemnified Officer/Director
shall be a third party beneficiary under this Agreement for purposes of
enforcing this _Section 6.11_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If subsequent to the Closing, the Buyer or the Company, or any of their
respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person in such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Buyer and the Company,
as the case may be, honor the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

(c) The obligations of the Buyer and the Company under this _Section 6.11_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner so as to adversely affect
any Person to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies without the prior written
consent of such affected Person.

Closing Date, it will (and the Buyer will cause the Company to) (i) provide
employees participating in Company medical or other welfare benefits prior to
the Closing Date with medical and other welfare benefits, which are
substantially similar in the aggregate to, and which require employee

of the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date, (the Company Plans
providing such medical and other welfare benefits are identified in _Section
3.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule); (ii) provide employees with a wage and
salary program no less favorable in the aggregate than that in place at the
Company immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (iii) provide employees
participating in other Company-sponsored benefits prior to the Closing Date
with benefits, which are substantially similar in the aggregate to, and which
require employee contributions no greater than, the corresponding benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of the Company immediately prior to
the Closing Date (the Company Plans providing such other benefits are
identified in _Section 3.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule), in each case,
after taking into account any changes to such benefits which are listed in
_Section 3.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, whether adopted before or after
the Closing Date. In addition, the Company agrees to (and the Buyer will cause
the Company to) give employees service credit for all periods of employment
with the Company prior to the Closing Date for purposes of vesting and
eligibility under any plan adopted or maintained by the Company after the
Closing Date in which such employees participate, but only to the extent
permitted by Law. With respect to the plan year in which the Closing occurs,
the Company agrees to waive any limitations regarding (preexisting conditions
and to give full credit for any co-payments made and deductibles fully or
partially satisfied prior to the Closing Date under any welfare or other
employee benefit plans maintained by the Company after the Closing Date for
the benefit of eligible employees, but only to the extent that such
limitations were waived and credit was given under the terms of the analogous
Company Plan prior to the Closing Date. Nothing contained in this _Section
6.12_, express or implied: (A) shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (B) shall alter or
limit the ability of Company, the Buyer or any of their Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any
time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, on a basis
that is not inconsistent with the provisions set forth in this _Section
6.12(a)_, (C) is intended to confer upon any Person any right to employment or
continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment, or (D) is intended
to confer upon any Person any other rights as a

 



      
 

 



 

third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate the Buyer to continue the employment of any employee for any specific
period.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Company shall be responsible for the
administration of and shall assume any and all obligations arising under the
continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of COBRA for those plan
participants in, and beneficiaries under, a Company Plan subject to COBRA.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended (i) to require Buyer or
the Company to establish or maintain any specific employee benefit plan or
arrangement on or after the Closing, or (ii) to create or amend any employee
benefit plan or arrangement. Without limiting the generality of _Section
10.1_ herein, the provisions of this _Section 6.12_ are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement. No employee or any other Person
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.13. _Employees_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall be responsible for providing any notice required
pursuant to WARN with respect to a layoff or plant closing relating to the
business of the Company that occurs as a result of or after the Closing. The
Company shall be responsible for providing any such notice with respect to a
layoff or plant closing occurring prior to the Closing, and shall notify the
Buyer of any such notice.

 



 

(b) The Company will permit Company employees to carry over and take accrued,
but unused, vacation days or time off with pay in accordance with the
applicable policies as in effect as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) To the extent necessary to comply with any Laws in foreign jurisdictions
which safeguard the rights of employees in transfers of undertakings,
businesses or parts of businesses, the Company shall comply with their
respective obligations under such Laws, including any obligations to maintain
certain terms and conditions of employment of employees to the extent the
failure to comply would result in a Liability being imposed on the Sellers.

 



 

Section 6.14. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Buyer will prepare and timely file, or cause the Company to prepare
and timely file, in a manner consistent with prior years, all Tax Returns
required to be filed with respect to the Company for all taxable periods
beginning on or prior to the Closing Date (including any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and any Straddle Period) that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date. The Buyer will deliver drafts of all such Tax Returns, together
with _pro forma_ return calculations for all Straddle Period Tax Returns
showing the amount of Tax payable with respect to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date, to the Sellers no later than twenty
Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Returns are required to be
filed. If, within ten Business Days following their receipt of the draft Tax
Returns, the Sellers do not dispute any provision of the draft Tax Returns,
then the draft Tax Returns shall be final. In the event that the Sellers
dispute any provision of the draft Tax Returns relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, then Buyer shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are
requested by the Sellers. In the event that the Sellers dispute any provision
of a Straddle Period Tax Return, then

 



       
 

 



 

such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions for disputing
the Preliminary Net Working Capital set forth in _Section 2.6(f)_ and
_Section 2.6(g)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the relevant time periods
shall be adjusted to allow for completion and filing of the Tax Returns on a
timely basis. If any such dispute cannot be resolved prior to the due date of
the applicable Tax Return, then the Buyer may file or cause to be filed the
Tax Return in the manner that it determines to be appropriate, but the dispute
between the Parties nonetheless shall be resolved in accordance with _Section
2.6(f)_ and _Section 2.6(g)_, and that resolution shall govern the rights of
the Parties hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
following the later of the date on which (A) a Tax Return required to be filed
by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6.14(a)_ is determined to be final or (B)
any dispute relating to any such Tax Return is resolved (including the
resolution of any dispute, in accordance with the provisions hereof, regarding
the entitlement of the Buyer to indemnification in relation to any amount of
Taxes payable in connection with such return), the Buyer shall be entitled to
direct the Escrow Agent, subject to the terms of the Sellers Escrow
Agreement, to release to the Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Amount an amount
equal to the portion of any Taxes required to be remitted in respect of such
Tax Return for which the Buyer Group is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to _Section 8.5(a)_.

 



 

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Sellers, neither the Buyer nor
the Company shall amend or allow to be amended any Tax Return filed with
respect to the Company for any taxable period beginning prior to the Closing
Date.

 



 

(c) Each of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand,
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly
as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of
any Tax Return, for the preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or Action relating to any proposed adjustment. The
Buyer and the Sellers agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any taxing authority, or
customer of the Company or any other Person, as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate a Tax that would otherwise be imposed with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Without the prior written consent of the Sellers, following the Closing
Date, none of the Company or Buyer shall make or change any election, change
an annual accounting period, adopt or change any accounting method, file any
amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or
assessment relating to the Company, surrender any right to claim a refund of
Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable
to any Tax claim or assessment relating to the Company, or take any similar
action relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax, if
such election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender,
consent or other action could reasonably be expected to have the effect of
increasing the Tax Liability of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (including any
election, adoption, change, amendment agreement, settlement, surrender,
consent or other action that would accelerate income to periods ending on or
before the Closing Date or defer deductions to periods ending after the
Closing Date). In the case of any Third Party Claim involving Taxes of the
Company, in the event of any inconsistency between this _Section 6.14(d)_ and
_Section 8.4_, this _Section 6.14(d)_ shall control.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Without the prior written consent of the Buyer, following the date of this
Agreement, none of the Company or the Sellers shall make or change any
election, change an annual accounting period, adopt or change any accounting
method, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle
any Tax claim or assessment relating to the Company, surrender any right to
claim a refund of Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation
period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment relating to the Company, or
take any similar action relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the
payment of any Tax, if such election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement,
settlement, surrender, consent or other action could reasonably be expected to
have the effect of increasing the Tax Liability of the Company for any period
beginning after the Closing Date (including any election, adoption, change,
amendment agreement, settlement, surrender, consent or other action that would
accelerate income to periods ending on or before the Closing Date or defer
deductions to periods ending after the Closing Date). In the case of any Third
Party Claim involving Taxes of the Company, in the event of any inconsistency
between this _Section 6.14(e)_ and _Section 8.4_, this _Section 6.14(e)_
shall control.

 



 

Section 6.15. _Transfer Taxes_. All applicable Transfer Taxes (including any
stock transfer Taxes due as a result of the sale of the Shares and any Taxes
imposed upon the transfer of real and personal property, including without
limitation direct or indirect transfers of control of or ownership interests
in an entity which owns real property) payable in connection with this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the documents
giving effect to such transactions shall be paid by the Buyer. The Buyer will,
at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Transfer Taxes.

 



 

Section 6.16. _Cooperation on Title Matters: Consents_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Buyer in connection with the Buyers obtaining
title insurance for the Owned Real Property (excluding the Waltham Facility
and the Logan Warehouse). Such cooperation will include the Company using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be delivered to the Buyer,
reasonably promptly after the date hereof, current preliminary title insurance
commitments and reports from Fidelity National Title Company (the " _Title
Company_ "), together with copies of the underlying title documents referenced
therein, for each parcel of Owned Real Property (excluding the Waltham
Facility) (collectively, the " _Title Insurance Commitments_ "); and (ii)
cause the 2007/2008 ALTA surveys of the Owned Real Property (excluding the
Waltham Facility and the Logan Warehouse) made available to the Buyer prior to
the date of this Agreement to be updated and delivered to the Buyer reasonably
promptly after the date hereof (collectively, the " _Surveys_ "). The Company
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to questions regarding
the Title Insurance Commitments and the Surveys, and to provide direct contact
to the surveyors and the Title Company to facilitate the review and issuance
to the Buyer of final Title Insurance Commitments and Surveys for each parcel
of the Owned Real Property, excluding the Waltham Facility. The cost to obtain
such Title Insurance Commitments and Surveys, and the cost of any title
insurance policies or endorsements thereto desired by the Buyer shall be paid
by the Buyer.

 



 

(b) Prior to Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consents to this transaction required by the Real Property Leases
listed in _Section 3.10(b)(2)_ of the Disclosure Schedule that require
written consent, and cooperate with the

 



      
 

 



 

Buyers efforts to obtain landlord lien waivers, estoppels and/or
nondisturbance agreements from landlords as reasonably requested by the Buyer.
The Company shall not be required to cooperate in the pursuit of the execution
or recording of memoranda of lease or leasehold mortgages with respect to
Leased Real Property.

the date of this Agreement that occurs prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Buyer the unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of such
calendar quarter-end and the related statements of income and cash flows for
the quarterly period ended on such calendar quarter-end. As soon as available,
but in any event no later than 15 days after each calendar month-end following
the date of this Agreement that occurs prior to Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Buyer a copy of the Companys normal, internal operating balance
sheet and internal profit and loss statement (as such internal reports are
currently generated with respect to the Company). The financial statements
required to be delivered pursuant to the preceding two sentences of this
Section 6.17 shall in each case be prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

Section 6.18. _Related-Party Agreements_. Except as set forth in Section 6.18
of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the Sellers shall terminate or
cause to be terminated, at Closing, the contracts and transactions requested
by Buyer to be so terminated that are required to be disclosed pursuant to
Section 3.24 (excluding any contracts or agreements with current employees
listed thereon), without any further liability to the Company or Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (other than the liability to pay for services provided to
the Company prior to the termination date of such contracts or transactions,
whether or not billed to the Company as of such date), and shall cause such
other parties thereto to release any and all claims against the Company, Buyer
or any of its Affiliates with respect to such agreements or transactions.

 



 

Section 6.19. _Non-Hire_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date through the second anniversary thereof, no
Seller shall, and each Seller shall cause each of its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, solicit or hire any of the individuals (or categories
of individuals) described in _Section 6.19(a)_ and _(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, in each case unless agreed to in writing by the Buyer, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing covenant shall not prevent any Seller or any of
its Affiliates from hiring any individual described in _Section 6.19(b)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule if such hiring is the result of (i) a response by such
individual to a general posting or advertisement placed by a Seller, Affiliate
or any agent or representative thereof, or (ii) contact or inquiry by the
individual not resulting from solicitation or inducement of such contact or
inquiry by a Seller or any Affiliate.

 



 

(b) Each Seller understands that the Buyer shall be entitled to protect and
preserve the going concern value of the business of the Company to the extent
permitted by Law and that the Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement
absent the provisions of this _Section 6.18_. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, it is understood and agreed that the remedy of indemnity
payments pursuant to _Article VIII_ and other remedies at Law would be
inadequate in the case of any breach of the covenants contained in this
_Section 6.19_. The Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

shall be entitled to equitable relief, including the remedy of specific
performance, with respect to any breach or attempted breach of such covenants.

(which approval shall not to be unreasonably withheld), take all action
necessary to satisfy the conditions for the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture pursuant to Section 11.01 thereof (other than the requirement for
deposit of funds with the trustee under the Indenture) and (ii) cooperate with
Buyer and the trustee and notes collateral agent under the Indenture to
achieve satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture at Closing and to release
all "Liens" on all "Collateral" (as each such term is defined in the
Indenture). Without limiting, and in furtherance of, the foregoing, the
Company will, when and as reasonably directed by Buyer (and in no event later
than two Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date) deliver to the
trustee under the Indenture (and execute, as applicable) in the form provided
by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Company, all documents necessary
under the Indenture, including Articles 3, 11 and 12 and Sections 13.04 and
13.05 of the Indenture, for the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture
and the release of the Liens on the Collateral under the Indenture, including,
but not limited to: (i) the officers certificate required by Section 3.01 of
the Indenture regarding the Companys election to redeem the "Notes" (as
defined in the Indenture) pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of
Section 3.07 of the Indenture, subject to the Closing; (ii) the notice of
redemption required pursuant to Section 3.03 of the Indenture; (iii) an

counsel pursuant to Section 12.06(b) of the Indenture; and (vi) form of
collateral release pursuant to Section 12.06(b) of the Indenture, in each
case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, the lenders
providing the Financing, and the trustee and notes collateral agent under the
Indenture.

 



 

Section 6.21. _280G_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall solicit
waivers from each participant who would otherwise receive an "parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code to voluntarily
reduce his payment to 2.99 times the participants "base amount" as determined
pursuant to Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code and, if and to the extent waivers
are obtained, the Company shall submit to its shareholders for approval by
such number of shareholders as is required pursuant to Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that the Company and Buyer
reasonably determine may, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
"parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder), such that such payments and benefits
shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code
and that the deduction of such payments and/or benefits will not be limited by
the application of Section 280G of the Code and the applicable regulations
thereunder.

 



 

Section 6.22. _Transfer of Company Stock_. Each Seller covenants that prior to
the Closing, without Buyers written consent, such Seller shall not (i) sell,
transfer, mortgage, pledge, or otherwise dispose of or suffer to be imposed

(ii) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any indemnification hereunder

(a) _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Each and every
covenant contained in this Agreement (other than the covenants which by their

none of the Sellers, the Company or the Buyer shall have any Liability
whatsoever with respect to any such covenant thereafter. The Surviving
Covenants will survive the Closing Date until, and will expire when, in each
case, the applicable statute of limitations has expired or until the
applicable Surviving Covenant expires in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. With the exception of (i) the Surviving Seller Representations set
forth in _Section 3.9_ (Tax Matters), which shall survive until the

The Surviving Buyer Representations shall survive indefinitely. The
obligations of each Party to indemnify and defend the other Parties and other
Persons pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall terminate upon the expiration
of the applicable survival periods as set forth above; _provided_ that to the
extent any claims for indemnification in respect of a breach of any such
representation or warranty is made on or before the date on which such
representation or warranty expires, then such representation or warranty shall
survive until the resolution of such claim.

 



 

(b) _Limitations on Indemnification Liability_.

 



 

(i) The following limitations shall apply to the indemnification Liability of
the Sellers:

 



 

A. The Sellers shall have no indemnification Liability to the Buyer Group for
Damages pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_ resulting from any single or
aggregated claims arising out of related facts, events or circumstances unless
the aggregate amount of all Damages resulting from such single or aggregated
claims arising out of related facts, events or circumstances in each case
exceeds One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000).

 



 

B. The Sellers shall have no indemnification Liability to the Buyer Group for
Damages pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_ unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Damages for all claims asserted by the Buyer Group pursuant to
_Section 8.1(a)(ii)_ exceeds Eight-tenths of One Percent (0.8%) of the Final
Purchase Price (the " _Deductible_ "), after which the Sellers shall indemnify
the Buyer Group only from and against Damages in excess of the Deductible.

 



 

C. Except as provided in _Section 8.2(b)(i)(D)_, the indemnification
obligations of the Sellers to the Buyer Group shall be limited to an aggregate
amount of seven percent (7.0%) of the Final Purchase Price.

 



 

D. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the limitations
on Damages set forth in this _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ with respect to the Sellers
shall not apply to any payments by the Sellers to the Buyer for breach of the
Sellers Surviving Covenants or pursuant the Fundamental Representations,
which shall be limited to an amount equal to the Final Purchase Price.

 



 

(ii) The following limitations shall apply to the indemnification Liability of
the Buyer:

 



       
 

 



 

A. The Buyer shall have no indemnification Liability to the Seller Group for
Damages pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Damages for all claims asserted by the Seller Group pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ exceeds the Deductible, after which the Buyer shall
indemnify the Seller Group only from and against Damages for claims asserted
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ in excess of the Deductible.

 



 

B. The indemnification obligations of the Buyer to the Seller Group shall in
all events be limited to an amount equal to the Final Purchase Price.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the limitations on
damages set forth in this _Section 8.2(b)_ shall not apply to claims by any
Party based on fraud or willful misconduct.

 



 

(c) The Sellers shall make any indemnification payments determined to be
payable to the Buyer hereunder without regard to any expectation that the
Buyer will recover insurance proceeds as a result of the matter giving rise to
the claim for which indemnification payments are to be made. The Buyer shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover insurance proceeds that may
be available to it or its Affiliates as a result of the matter giving rise to
any indemnification claim of the Buyer; _provided_ that such efforts shall not
be a condition precedent to the ability of the Buyer to seek indemnification
hereunder. If the Buyer Group or any Affiliate actually receives any insurance
proceeds as a result of the matter giving rise to any indemnification claim of
the Buyer prior to the date upon which the Sellers are given notice of such
claim, then the Sellers indemnification obligation with respect to such claim
shall be reduced by the amount of any such insurance proceeds actually
received by the Buyer. If the Buyer actually receives any insurance proceeds
as a result of the matter giving rise to any indemnification claim of the
Buyer against the Sellers after the Sellers have paid such indemnification
claim to a member of the Buyer, then the Buyer shall promptly turn over any
such insurance proceeds received to the Sellers to the extent of the payments
made by the Sellers to the Buyer on the claim.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any
amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this
_Article VIII_ shall be paid without duplication, and in no event shall any
Party be indemnified under this Agreement for Damages, to the extent such
indemnification in respect of such Damages has been actually paid to such
Party pursuant to another provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Damages as used herein shall not include and in no event shall any
Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified Party for, any incidental,
consequential, punitive or similar damages; it being understood and agreed,
however, that an Indemnifying Party shall be liable to an Indemnified Party
with respect to (i) any penalties actually incurred by such Indemnified Party
and (ii) any incidental, consequential, punitive or similar damages arising
from a Third Party Claim that such Indemnified Party is required to pay to any
Person who is not a Party (or an Affiliate thereof).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.3. _Manner of Indemnification Payment_.

 



 

(a) The Buyer Group or Seller Group Member (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
seeking indemnification hereunder shall give to the party obligated to provide
indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
reasonably prompt written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification
hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or
the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument
executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced as a result thereof.

 



 

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
_Article VIII_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party; (ii) by a final judgment or
decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to
which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall agree. The
judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,
if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all
appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall
have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Damages suffered by it.
Any indemnification payments shall be made together with interest accruing
thereon from the date such payment is finally determined to be payable to the
date of payment at the Applicable Rate.

 



 

(c) The Buyer shall be entitled to recover any indemnification owing to the
Buyer Group pursuant to this _Article VIII_ by (i) directing the Escrow
Agent, subject to the terms of the Sellers Escrow Agreement, to release to
the Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Amount an amount equal to the Sellers
Part times the amount owed to the Buyer pursuant to this _Article VIII_, and
(ii) directing the Company to direct the Escrow Agent, subject to the terms of
the Phantom Escrow Agreement, to release to the Company from the Indemnity
Escrow Amount an amount equal to the Phantom Part times the amount owed
pursuant to this _Article VIII_. The Sellers liability under this Agreement
shall not be limited by the Escrow Fund and, in the event the Escrow Fund is
depleted, Buyer shall be entitled to recover any indemnification owing to the
Buyer Group pursuant to this _Article VIII_ directly from the Sellers.

 



 

(d) Any indemnification owing to the Buyer Group pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ in excess of the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be effected by direct
recourse to the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from
the Sellers to an account designated in writing by the Buyer Group within
fifteen days after the determination thereof. Any indemnification owing to the
Seller Group pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be effected by direct
recourse to the Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from
the Buyer to an account designated in writing by the Sellers within fifteen
days after the determination thereof.

 



 

Section 8.4. _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) If any claim or demand is made against an Indemnified Party or the Company
with respect to any matter, or any Indemnified Party shall otherwise learn of
an

 



      
 

 



 

assertion or of a potential claim, by any Person who is not a Party (or an
Affiliate thereof) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any claim or
demand, or threatened claim or demand, arising under _Section 8.5(a)_) (each
a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification
against an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement, then the Indemnified Party
shall promptly give the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice in reasonable detail
of the Third Party Claim (including the factual basis for the Third Party
Claim, and, to the extent known, the amount of the Third Party Claim);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced as a result thereof (except that the Indemnifying
Party will not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which
the Indemnified Party failed to give such notice); it being understood and
agreed that the failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying
Party prior to settling a Third Party Claim (whether by paying a claim or
executing a binding settlement agreement with respect thereto) or the entry of
a judgment or issuance of an award with respect to a Third Party Claim shall
constitute actual prejudice to the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
against such Third Party Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will deliver
to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified Partys receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
or transmitted by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in or to assume
the defense of the Third Party Claim (in either case in good faith and at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party) with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that in the case of any
Third Party Claim relating to Taxes for any Straddle Period, the Indemnifying
Party shall only have the right to participate in the defense of such Third-
Party Claim (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnifying Party
will be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has
failed to assume the defense thereof (other than during any period in which
the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give written notice of the Third
Party Claim as provided above following a reasonable period of time to provide
such notice). Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if the Parties reasonably agree that a conflict of interest
exists in respect of such claim, such Indemnified Party will have the right to
employ separate counsel and any appropriate local counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to represent such Indemnified Party and
in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (but
not more than one separate counsel and any appropriate local counsel for all
Indemnified Parties) shall be paid by such Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party, at its sole cost and expense, may retain separate counsel,
and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being understood
that the Indemnifying Party will control such defense subject to the
limitations set out in this _Article VIII_.

 



 

(c) No Indemnifying Party will consent to any settlement, compromise or
discharge (including the consent to entry of any judgment) of any Third Party
Claim without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld,

 



      
 

 



 

delayed or conditioned); _provided_ that, subject to _Section 6.14(d)_ and
_Section 6.14(e)_, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of such Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party may recommend
and which by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount
of Damages in connection with such settlement, compromise or discharge and
releases the Indemnified Party from Liability in connection with such Third
Party Claim, _provided_ that such settlement, compromise or discharge does not
impose any material non-monetary restrictions or obligations on the
Indemnified Party. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not admit any
Liability, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
or compromise with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party informed of all
material developments relating to or in connection with such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend a Third Party Claim, the
Parties will cooperate in the defense thereof (with the Indemnifying Party
being responsible for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified
Party (other than for the fees and expenses of its counsel unless provided
otherwise in _Section 8.4(b)_) in connection with such cooperation), which
cooperation will include the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records
and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend such Third Party Claim and may
settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim in good faith at the risk and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall retain its right to participate in such defense and the Indemnified
Party shall use its reasonable efforts to consult with the Indemnifying Party
concerning such matter.

 



 

(f) In the event of payment in full by an Indemnifying Party to any
Indemnified Party in connection with any claim (each an " _Indemnified Claim_
"), such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will stand in the place
of such Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of
which such Indemnified Party may have any right or claim relating to such
Indemnified Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Indemnified
Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnified Party will cooperate with
such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of
such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right or claim.

 



 

Section 8.5. _Tax Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers shall, jointly and not severally, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Buyer Group from and against all Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) all Taxes of any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of
which the Company (or any predecessor thereof) is or was a member on or prior
to the Closing Date, including any Liability for the Taxes

 



      
 

 



 

of any such Person pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6 (or any similar state,
local or foreign Law), and (iii) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) for
which the Company has any Liability as a transferee or successor, by contract
or otherwise, in each case arising from an event, transaction, act or omission
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, excluding, in each case, the amount
of accrued but unpaid Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are specifically
included in the determination of Closing Net Working Capital, but taking into
account any amounts paid to the Sellers pursuant to the second to last
sentence of _Section 8.5(c)_.

 



 

(b) In the case of any Straddle Period (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall not include any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date),
(i) the amount of any income Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes and other
Taxes of the Company that are readily apportionable between periods based on
an actual or deemed closing of the books and that are payable with respect to
the period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined based on an interim
closing of the books as of the Close of Business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and (ii) the
amount of other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period that relates to the
period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the taxable period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period, provided that, Company Transaction Expenses and any expenses
incurred in connection with the repayment of Company Indebtedness shall be
deemed to be attributable solely to the taxable period or portion of such
taxable period ending on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) If the Buyer or the Company receives any Tax refund, or becomes entitled
to any amount credited against Tax, that relates to Tax periods or portions
thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, other than (i) a refund or
credit that was included in the determination of Closing Net Working Capital
or (ii) a refund or credit resulting from a carryback of a Tax item from a
taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date, then the
Buyer shall pay over to the Sellers in cash any such refund or the amount of
any such credit, net of Tax cost to the Buyer or the Company arising in
respect of such refund or credit, within thirty days after receipt or
entitlement thereto. In the event that the Sellers dispute the amount of the
Tax cost to the Buyer or the Company arising in respect of such refund or
credit, then such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions
for disputing the Preliminary Net Working Capital set forth in _Section
2.6(f)_ and _Section 2.6(g). _If and to the extent that the amount of any
refund or credit that was included in the determination of Closing Net Working
Capital exceeds the amount of such refund or credit actually received by the
Company after the Closing Date, then the Sellers shall, jointly and not
severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Group from and
against the amount of such excess. If and to the extent that the amount of
accrued but unpaid Taxes specifically included in the determination of Closing
Net Working Capital exceeds the total amount of Taxes paid by the Company
after the Closing Date with respect to any period ending on the Closing Date
(on the basis that any Company Transaction Expenses and any expenses incurred
in connection with the repayment of Company Indebtedness that are deductible
in any taxable year that includes the Closing Date are attributable solely to
the taxable period or portion thereof ending on the Closing Date), then the
excess shall be paid to the Sellers. The foregoing provisions shall be applied
without

 



      
 

 



 

duplication, so that the Buyer shall not be obligated to pay an amount to the
Sellers pursuant to both the first sentence of this _Section 8.5(c)_ and the
preceding sentence of this _Section 8.5(c)_ with respect to the same refund
or credit.

 



 

Section 8.6. _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy for any and all claims arising under, out of, or related to this
Agreement, or the sale and purchase of the Company (other than claims arising
from fraud or willful misconduct), shall be the rights of indemnification set
forth in this _Article VIII_ only, and no Person will have any other
entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, it
being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are
expressly waived and released by the Parties hereto to the fullest extent
permitted by law; _provided_ , however, that nothing in this _Section 8.6_
shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any specific performance or
equitable relief for breach of any confidentiality provision or covenant set
forth in this Agreement or any Transaction Document. In connection with the
seeking of any non-monetary equitable relief, each of the Parties acknowledges
and agrees that the other Party hereto would be damaged irreparably in the
event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or otherwise breached.

by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other Action shall not be
subject to appeal or shall have become final and unappealable; _provided_ ,
that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement shall have used its
commercially reasonable efforts to remove or lift such order, decree, ruling
or other Action, if it has standing to do so, before it became final and
unappealable, and, provided, further, that the right to terminate pursuant to
this _Section 9.1(c)_ is not available to any Party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement results in or causes such order, decree, ruling or
other Action, or (ii) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) by the Buyer by written notice to the Sellers if the Buyer is not then in
material breach of any provision of this Agreement and there has been a
breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by the Company or the Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 7.1_ or _7.3_ and such breach, inaccuracy or failure is not
curable or, if curable, it has not been cured by the Company or the Sellers,
as the case may be, on or before the Drop Dead Date; or

Company are not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement and

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.2_ and such breach, inaccuracy or failure is not
curable or, if curable, it has not been cured by the Buyer on or before the
Drop Dead Date.

Affiliates), except that (a) the obligations of the Parties and their
respective Affiliates, agents and representatives under _Section 6.3(b)_
(Confidentiality), _Section 6.7_ (Public Announcements) this _Section 9.2_,
_Article X_ (Miscellaneous), and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect, (b) such termination shall not relieve the Buyer of

representation contained in this Agreement (including under _Article VI_)
prior to such termination, and (c) such termination shall not relieve any
Seller or the Company of any Liability for fraud or any breach of any material
obligation, covenant or representation contained in this Agreement (including
under _Article VI_) prior to such termination.

supplemented or otherwise modified except in a written instrument executed by
each of the Parties. No waiver by any of the Parties of any default,

Section 10.5. _Exhibits and Schedules_.

 



 

(a) All Exhibits and Schedules, including the Disclosure Schedule, are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Any matter disclosed
pursuant to any Section of or Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedule (or any section of any Schedule or Exhibit to this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule) whose relevance or applicability to any
representation made elsewhere in this Agreement or to the information called
for by any other Section of or Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedule

 



      
 

 



 

(or any other Section of any Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedule) is reasonably apparent from the text of the disclosure
shall be deemed to be an exception to such representations and to be disclosed
with respect to all such other Sections of and Schedules and Exhibits to this
Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule (and all sections of all Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule) where it is reasonably
apparent from the text of the disclosure, notwithstanding the omission of a
reference or cross-reference thereto.

 



 

(b) Neither the specification of any Dollar amount in any representation or
warranty nor the mere inclusion of any item in a Schedule or in the Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall be deemed an
admission by a Party that such item represents an exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Buyer to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.6. _Headings_. The table of contents and section headings contained

with respect to the sale and purchase of the Shares and supersede any prior
understandings, negotiations, agreements, discussions or representations among
the Parties of any nature, whether written or oral, to the extent they relate

Section 10.9. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void
or unenforceable in any respect, all other provisions of this Agreement, or
the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those
as to which it has been held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such determination that any provision,
or the application of any such provision, is invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by Law in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest
extent possible.

 



 

Section 10.10. _Expenses_. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all
costs and expenses incident to the process leading to the execution of this
Agreement, the negotiations and preparation of this Agreement and the
performance by a Party of its obligations hereunder, including the fees and
disbursements of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts and

 



       
 

 



 

consultants employed by the respective Parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be borne and paid by the Party
incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions and covenants of this _Section
10.10_ will survive the Closing and will remain in force indefinitely.

 



 

Section 10.11. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be governed by the Laws of the State of New York without regard to the
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of any Law
other than the Law of the State of New York.

 



 

Section 10.12. _Arbitration_.

 



 

(a) This _Section 10.12_ shall not be of any force or effect unless and until
the Closing shall have occurred. From and after the Closing, except with
respect to any Action initiated to assert a fraud claim or as otherwise
expressly set forth in _Section 2.6_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, subject to _Section 10.12(b)_, any dispute, controversy or claim
between the Parties to this Agreement arising from or in connection with this
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby whether based on
contract, tort, common law, equity, statute, regulation, order or otherwise (a
" _Dispute_ "), regardless of the magnitude thereof or the amount in
controversy, shall be submitted to, and finally determined by, arbitration in
accordance with the following provisions of this _Section 10.12(a)_:

 



 

(i) Any such arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration
Association (" _AAA_ ") in accordance with the AAA Commercial Rules (" _AAA
Rules_ "), except as the AAA Rules conflict with the provisions of this
_Section 10.12_, in which event the provisions of this _Section 10.12_ shall
control.

 



 

(ii) The arbitral panel (the " _Panel_ ") shall consist of three arbitrators
independent of the parties (the " _Arbitrators_ "). The Arbitrators shall be
appointed pursuant to AAAs procedure for selecting arbitrators as described
in the AAA Rules. Each Arbitrator shall be either an attorney or business
person knowledgeable in commercial matters and have at least ten years
experience in his field of expertise.

 



 

(iii) The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New York or in such
other location as the Parties may designate by mutual written consent.

 



 

(iv) The Panel may in its discretion order a pre-hearing exchange of
information including production of documents, exchange of summaries of
testimony or exchange of statements of position, and shall schedule promptly
limited discovery (to the extent necessary and appropriate) and other
procedural steps and otherwise assume case management initiative and control
to effect an efficient and expeditious resolution of the Dispute.

 



 

(v) At any oral hearing of evidence in connection with an arbitration pursuant
to this _Section 10.12_, each party and its legal counsel shall have the
right to examine its witnesses and to cross-examine the witnesses of the other
party. No testimony of any witness shall be presented in written form unless
the opposing party or

 



      
 

 



 

parties shall have the opportunity to cross-examine such witness, except as
the parties otherwise agree in writing or except under extraordinary
circumstances where, in the opinion of the Panel, the interests of justice
require a different procedure.

 



 

(vi) Within 15 days after the closing of the arbitration hearing, the Panel
shall prepare and distribute to the parties a written award setting forth the
Panels findings of facts and conclusions of law relating to the Dispute,
including the reasons for the giving or denial of any award or relief. Except
as necessary in court Actions to enforce this arbitration provision or an
award rendered or relief granted hereunder as required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange or to comply with applicable accounting
and Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure obligations, or to obtain
interim relief, no party hereto nor an Arbitrator may disclose the existence,
content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written
consent of each of the Buyer and the Representative.

 



 

(vii) The Parties consent that any notice of arbitration upon the other Party
by the Party instituting such arbitration shall be deemed sufficient if made
in accordance with _Section 10.3_, and that such notice shall have the same
effect as if personal service of notice had been made. A judgment upon the
award rendered by the Panel may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
over the relevant Parties.

 



 

(viii) The Buyer and the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) agree to
share equally the cost of any administrative fee, any compensation of the
Arbitrators and any expenses of any witnesses or proof produced at the direct
request of the Panel, provided, however, that the Panel, in its discretion,
may allocate such fees and expenses between the parties in any manner it deems
appropriate to reflect (i) the decision or any award of the Panel, (ii) each
partys efforts to comply with this _Section 10.12_ in good faith or (iii)
such factors as the Panel deems relevant.

 



 

(ix) The Parties shall each bear all their own costs and attorneys fees and
expenses of arbitration.

 



 

(x) The Panel shall not have the power or authority to award any incidental,
consequential, punitive or similar damages (other than those required to be
paid to a third party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim pursuant to a final,
non-appealable order or as set forth in _Section 8.6_). Otherwise, the Panel
shall have the authority to grant any other relief a court of competent
jurisdiction could grant, including an injunction or other equitable relief.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the Dispute resolution procedures contained in this
_Section 10.12_, (i) nothing in this _Section 10.12_ shall prohibit any
Party from joining another party in an Action initiated by a Person that is
not a party hereto and (ii) any Party may apply to any court specified in
_Section 10.13_ (A) to enforce this agreement to arbitrate, (B) to seek
provisional injunctive relief so as to enforce any agreements in this
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby until the arbitration
award is rendered or the Dispute is otherwise resolved, (C) to avoid the
expiration of any applicable limitation period, (D) to preserve a superior
position with respect to other creditors, (E) to challenge or vacate any final

 



      
 

 



 

judgment, award or decision of the Panel that does not comport with the
express provisions of this _Section 10.12_ or (F) to enforce any provision of
this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby that provides for
specific performance, a restraining order, a permanent or temporary injunction
or other equitable remedy.

 



 

Section 10.13. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties submits to the
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in New York, New York, in
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and agrees that,
subject to _Section 10.12_, all claims in respect of the Action may be heard
and determined in any such court. Each Party also agrees not to bring any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any Action so brought and waives any bond, surety, or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Each
of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the service of process of any of
the aforementioned courts in any such Action by the mailing of copies thereof
by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to its address set forth in
_Section 10.3_, such service to become effective ten days after such mailing.
Nothing in this _Section 10.13_, however, shall affect the right of any Party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or at equity. Each
Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law or at equity.

 



 

Section 10.14. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

Section 10.15. _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each
nonbreaching Party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not
be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties
hereto (a) will waive the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law in any action
for specific performance and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any other
remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific
performance of this Agreement in any Action instituted, without posting any
bond or giving any other undertaking. In the event that a Party institutes any
Action pursuant to this _Section 10.15_, the prevailing Party in the Action
shall be entitled to receive the costs incurred thereby in conducting the
Action, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.

 



 

Section 10.16. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument, and any such counterpart
executed and delivered via facsimile transmission or via email with scan or
email attachment will be deemed an original for all intents and purposes.

 



 

Section 10.17. _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.18. _Seller Representative_.

 



 

(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints Hugh
Sutcliffe as its agent and representative (the " _Representative_ ") for all
purposes under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreements. In the event of the
death, resignation or incapacity of the Representative, the Sellers shall
promptly designate another individual to act as their representative under
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreements so that at all times there will be a
Representative with the authority provided in this _Section 10.18_. Such
successor Representative shall be designated by the Sellers by an instrument
in writing signed by the Sellers (or their successors in interest) holding a
majority of the Shares, and such appointment shall become effective as to the
successor Representative when such instrument shall have been delivered to it
and a copy thereof delivered to the Buyer.

 



 

(b) Each Seller hereby authorizes the Representative, on its behalf and in its
name, to:

 



 

(i) receive all notices or documents given or to be given to such Seller
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith and to receive and accept service of
legal process in connection with any suit or Action arising under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreements. The Representative shall promptly forward
a copy of such notice of process to such Seller;

 



 

(ii) deliver at the Closing the certificates for the Purchase Shares in
exchange for such Sellers Pro Rata Share of the consideration payable with
respect to all of the Purchase Shares;

 



 

(iii) upon confirmation of the receipt of wire transfers, sign and deliver to
the Buyer at the Closing a receipt for such Sellers Pro Rata Share of the
consideration and forward such amount to each Seller;

 



 

(iv) deliver to the Buyer at the Closing all certificates and documents to be
delivered to the Buyer by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreements, together with any other certificates and documents executed by
such Seller and deposited with the Representative for such purpose;

 



 

(v) engage legal counsel, accountants and other advisors for the Sellers and
incur such other expenses on behalf of the Sellers in connection with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby as the Representative may deem appropriate; and

 



 

(vi) take such action on behalf of the Sellers as the Representative may deem
appropriate in respect of:

 



 

A. waiving any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of the Buyer
contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreements or in any document
delivered by the Buyer pursuant thereto;

 



      
 

 



 

B. waiving the fulfillment of any of the conditions precedent to the Sellers
obligations hereunder, except with respect to payment of the consideration due
to the Sellers under _Section 2.2_;

 



 

C. any such other action as the Representative is authorized to take under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreements;

 



 

D. receiving all documents or certificates and making all determinations, on
behalf of the Sellers required or permitted under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreements, including in respect of any indemnification claims;

 



 

E. all such other matters as the Representative may deem necessary or
appropriate to consummate this Agreement, the Escrow Agreements and the
transactions contemplated by such instruments; and

 



 

F. all such actions as may be necessary after the Closing Date to carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreements.

 



 

(c) The appointment of the Representative hereunder is irrevocable and any
action taken by the Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this
_Section 10.18_ shall be effective and absolutely binding on each Seller
notwithstanding any contrary action of, or direction from, a Seller, except
for actions taken by the Representative that constitute willful misconduct or
gross negligence.

 



 

(d) The Representative may resign at any time by giving written notice to each
Seller, and such resignation shall be effective upon the appointment and
qualification of a successor. The Representative may be discharged, and
replaced by another natural person to act as his or her successor, by an
instrument in writing signed by the Sellers (or their successors in interest)
holding a majority of the Shares.

 



 

(e) In performing any duties as Representative under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreements, the Representative shall not incur any Liability to any
Person, except for Liability caused by the Representatives willful misconduct
or gross negligence. Accordingly, the Representative shall not incur any such
Liability for (i) any action taken or omitted in good faith regarding any
questions relating to the duties and responsibilities of the Representative
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreements, or (ii) any action taken or
omitted to be taken in reliance upon any instrument that the Representative
shall in good faith believe to be genuine, to have been signed or delivered by
a proper person or persons, and to conform with the provisions of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreements. The Sellers, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Representative against, from and in
respect of any Liability or loss arising out of or resulting from the
performance of his or her duties hereunder or in connection with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreements (except for Liabilities or losses arising
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Representative). The
Buyer shall not be liable to the Sellers for dealing with the Representative
in good faith (other than as a result of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Buyer).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.19. _Guaranty_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the conditions and limitations as set forth below, the
Guarantor hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as
principal and not as surety, to the Sellers and their successors, the due and
punctual payment and the full and complete performance of all monetary
obligations of the Buyer to the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, including
under _Section 2.2_, the Buyers representation and warranty set forth in
_Section 5.5_, the Buyers obligations under the covenants contained in
_Article VI_, and the Buyers specific performance obligations under _Section
10.15_, as the case may be, in the event that the Closing is not consummated
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the guaranty obligations under
this _Section 10.19_, collectively, the " _Guarantied Obligations_ "). The
obligations of Guarantor under this _Section 10.19_ shall terminate and be of
no further force or effect contemporaneous with the Closing.

 



 

(b) The Guarantor guarantees that the Guarantied Obligations will be duly and
punctually paid and fully and completely performed, as if the Guarantor were
the primary obligor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If for any
reason the Buyer shall fail or be unable duly and punctually to pay or fully
and completely to perform any Guarantied Obligation as and when the same shall
become due or otherwise required, then the Guarantor shall, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, forthwith duly and punctually pay or
fully and completely perform such Guarantied Obligation (in the case of
performance, as if the Guarantor was the primary obligor). The Guarantor
further agrees that this Agreement, to the extent it requires the payment of
money, constitutes a guaranty of payment when due and not of collection and is
in no way conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to collect from the
Buyer. The Guarantors Liability under this Agreement shall be absolute,
unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective, without limitation,
of:

 



 

(i) Any lack of validity or enforceability of the Agreement as a result of the
application of any Remedies Exception to the Buyer

 



 

(ii) any modification, amendment, consent, extension, forbearance or waiver of
or any consent to departure from this Agreement that may be agreed to by the
Buyer;

 



 

(iii) any action or inaction by the Sellers under or in respect of this
Agreement, any failure, lack of diligence, omission or delay on the part of
any Seller to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy conferred
on any Seller in this Agreement;

 



 

(iv) any merger or consolidation of the Company, the Parties or any other
Person into or with any Person, or any sale, lease or transfer of any of the
assets of the Company, the Parties or any other Person to any other Person; or

 



 

(v) any change in the ownership of any of the Company, the Parties or any
Person.

 



 

(c) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally waives (i) any and all notices,
including promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of this Agreement and
any other notice

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations and this Agreement, (ii) any
presentment, demand, performance, protest, notice of non-payment as the same
pertains to the Buyer, suit or the taking of other action by any Seller
against, and any other notice to, the Buyer, the Guarantor or others with
respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, (iii) any right to require any
Seller to proceed against the Buyer or to exhaust any security held by any
Seller or to pursue any other remedy with respect to any of the Guarantied
Obligations, (iv) any defense based upon an election of remedies by the
Sellers, unless the same would excuse performance by the Buyer under this
Agreement with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations and (v) any duty
of the Sellers to advise the Guarantor of any information known to the Sellers
regarding the Buyer or their ability to perform under this Agreement with
respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations. Each Seller may at any time and
from time to time without notice to or consent of the Guarantor and without
impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder, with
respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, (A) agree with the Buyer to make
any change in the terms of the Guarantied Obligations, (B) take or fail to
take any action of any kind in respect of any security for the Guarantied
Obligations, (C) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the
Buyer or others, or (D) compromise or subordinate the Guarantied Obligations,
including any security therefor. Any other suretyship defenses are hereby
waived by the Guarantor with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 10.19_ shall continue to be effective or
be reinstated, as the case may be, if (i) at any time and to the extent that
any payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned by the payee thereof upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar event of the Buyer or the Guarantor, all as though
such payment had not been made or (ii) the obligations of the Guarantor under
this _Section 10.19_, with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, are
released in consideration of a payment of money or transfer of property by the
Buyer or any other Person and to the extent that such payment, transfer or
grant is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the recipient thereof upon
the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar event of the Buyer, the
Guarantor or such other Person, all as though such payment, transfer or grant
had not been made.

 



 

Section 10.20. _No Implied Representations_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in _Article III_, _Article IV_, _Article V_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, it is the explicit intent of each Party hereto
that none of the Parties is making any representation or warranty whatsoever,
express or implied, beyond those expressly set forth in _Article III_,
_Article IV_, _Article V_ or any other provision of this Agreement,
including any implied warranty or representation as to the value, condition,
merchantability or suitability as to any of the properties or assets of the
Company. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, it is
expressly understood by each Party hereto that any cost estimates, projections
or other predictions contained or referred to in the Schedules hereto or in
the materials that have been provided to the Buyer are not and shall not be
deemed to be representations or warranties of any Seller or the Company,
including representations or warranties as to the future financial prospects
of or return from future operations of the business of the Company.

 



 

Section 10.21. _Claims Against Debt Financing Sources_. Subject to the rights
of the parties to the Commitment Letters under the terms thereof, none of the
parties hereto shall have any rights or claims against the lenders, any other
financing sources of the Financing or any Affiliate thereof (collectively, the
" _Debt Financing Sources_ "), solely in their respective

 



      
 

 



 

capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Financing, and the
Debt Financing Sources, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or
arrangers, shall not have any rights or claims against any party hereto or any
related person thereof, in connection with this Agreement or the Financing,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Without limiting
the foregoing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
each of the parties hereto (x) agrees that it will not, and that it will use
commercially reasonable efforts to not permit any of its Affiliates to, bring
or support any action or proceeding (whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) against a Debt Financing Source in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment
Letters or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof) and (y) waives any right to trial by jury in respect of any such
claim, suit, action or proceeding. The provisions of this Section, as well as
Section 9.2, shall be enforceable by each Debt Financing Source, its
Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns as express
third-party beneficiaries.

(a) LIFO reserves are calculated and recorded in accordance with GAAP. They
have been excluded from finished goods, goods in process and raw materials
inventories as non-cash items.

 



 

(2) Represents adjustment for the stores pushdown credit of $6,138. This
credit represents a write-down of parts inventory to reflect negative
goodwill arising from the purchase price allocation to the Companys assets
in the acquisition of the Company by the Sellers. This is a non-cash item and
has been excluded, as it will be revalued upon acquisition.

 



 

(3) current deferred tax assets of $1,349 have been excluded as a non-cash
item.

 



 

(4) Included in Net Cash Amount.

 



 

(5) Was included as a component of Other taxes payable on the Companys 2012
Audited Financial Statements. Will take into account the tax effect of
payments for Company Transaction Expenses and all expenses of the Company in
relation to repayment of Company Indebtedness, which may cause Income taxes
payable to be below zero.

 



 

(6) Accrued interest of $3,200 has been excluded as it represents accrued
interest on outstanding debt and is included in Company Indebtedness.
