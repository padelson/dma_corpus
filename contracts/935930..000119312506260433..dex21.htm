The Merger

2.01 _The Parent Merger._ At the Effective Time, (i) CFC shall be merged with

and BBandT shall survive and continue to exist as a North Carolina corporation
(BBandT, as the surviving corporation in the Parent Merger, sometimes being
referred to herein as the _"Surviving Corporation"_ ). The BBandT Articles, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and the BBandT Bylaws, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. BBandT may at any time prior to the Effective Time change the
method of effecting the Merger (including, without limitation, the provisions
of this Article II other than this sentence) if and to the extent it deems
such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided, however_ ,
that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of
consideration to be issued to holders of CFC Stock as provided for in Article
III of this Agreement (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.05),
(ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of CFCs shareholders as a result of
receiving the Merger Consideration, or (iii) materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.02 _The Subsidiary Merger._ At the time specified by BBandT Bank in its
Articles of Merger filed with the North Carolina Secretary of State (which
shall not be earlier than the Effective Time), Bank shall merge with and into
BBandT Bank (the " _Subsidiary Merger_ ") pursuant to an agreement to merge
(the " _Agreement to Merge_ ") to be executed by Bank and BBandT Bank and filed
with the North Carolina Secretary of State and the OTS, as required. Upon
consummation of the Subsidiary Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Bank shall cease and BBandT Bank shall survive and continue to exist as a North
Carolina state banking corporation and BBandT Bank shall surrender the Banks
Charter to the OTS as required by Section 552.13(k) of the rules and
regulations of the OTS. (The Parent Merger and the Subsidiary Merger shall
sometimes collectively be referred to herein as the " _Merger"_.)

2.03 _Effectiveness of the Parent Merger._ Subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the Parent Merger shall
become effective upon the occurrence of the filing of articles of merger with
the North Carolina Secretary of State in accordance with Section 55-11-05 of
the NCBCA and the filing of the certificate of merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State in accordance with Section 252 of the DGCL, or such later
date and time as may be set forth in such filings (the time the Merger becomes
effective on the Effective Date being referred to as the _"Effective Time")._



 

7 2.04 _Effective Date and Effective Time_. Subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the closing of the Merger
(the _"Closing"_ ) will take place in the offices of the BBandT Legal Department
at 200 West Second Street, Third Floor, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, at
11:00 a.m. on (i) the date designated by BBandT that is within thirty (30) days
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VII, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing (the  _"Effective Date"_ ); _provided, however,_ that no such
designation shall cause the Effective Date to fall after the date specified in
Section 8.01(c) hereof or after the date or dates on which any Regulatory
Authority approval or any extension thereof expires, or (ii) such other date
to which the parties may agree in writing.

ARTICLE III 

Consideration; Exchange Procedures

3.01 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Parent Merger and without
any action on the part of any Person, each share of CFC Common Stock
(excluding Company-Owned Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into shares of BBandT Common Stock based
upon a fixed exchange ratio (the _"Stock Exchange Ratio"_ ) of .385 of a
share of BBandT Common Stock for each share of CFC Common Stock (subject to
adjustment as set forth in Section 3.05) (the _"Merger Consideration"_ ).

(a) _Company-Owned Stock_. Each share of CFC Common Stock held as Company-
Owned Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor.

(b) _Outstanding BB andT Common Stock_. Each share of BBandT Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued
and outstanding and unaffected by the Merger.

3.02 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time, holders
of CFC Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
shareholders of CFC, other than to receive any dividend or other distribution
with respect to such CFC Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to
the Effective Time, and the consideration provided under this Article III, and
each certificate previously representing any such shares of CFC Common Stock
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive without interest (i) the
number of whole shares of BBandT Common Stock and (ii) cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which the shares of CFC Common Stock represented by
such certificate have been converted pursuant to this Article III. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of CFC
or the Surviving Corporation of any shares of CFC Stock.

3.03 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of BBandT Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor,
or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger. Instead,
BBandT shall pay to each holder of CFC Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fractional share of BBandT Common Stock  



 

8  (after taking into account all Old Certificates (as defined below) delivered
by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying such fractional share of BBandT Common Stock to which the holder
would be entitled by the average of the last sale price of BBandT Common Stock
as of the market close (as reported on NYSEnet.com or, if not reported
thereon, in another authoritative source) for the five (5) trading days
immediately preceding the Effective Date.

3.04 _Exchange Procedures_. (a) At or after the Effective Time, BBandT shall
cause BBandT Bank (in such capacity, the _"Exchange Agent"_ ), for the benefit
of the holders of certificates formerly representing shares of CFC Common
Stock ( _"Old Certificates"_ ), to exchange for outstanding shares of CFC
Common Stock in accordance with this Article III, certificates representing
shares of BBandT Common Stock ( _"New Certificates"_ ) and an amount of cash for
any fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.03 (together with any
dividends or distributions with a record date occurring on or after the
Effective Date with respect thereto without any interest on any such cash,
dividends or distributions). 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, upon the
shareholders delivery to the Exchange Agent of Old Certificates owned by
such shareholder representing shares of CFC Common Stock (or an indemnity
affidavit reasonably satisfactory to BBandT and the Exchange Agent, if any, if
such certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed), BBandT shall cause New
Certificates into which such shares of CFC Common Stock are converted on the
Effective Date to be delivered to such shareholder and/or any check in respect
of cash to be paid as part of the Merger Consideration (and in respect of any
fractional share interests, dividends or distributions that such shareholder
shall be entitled to receive). No interest will be paid on any such cash to be
paid in lieu of fractional share interests or in respect of dividends or
distributions that any such shareholder shall be entitled to receive pursuant
to this Article III.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any former holder of CFC Common Stock for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to BBandT Common Stock with
a record date occurring on or after the Effective Date shall be paid to the
record holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate representing shares of CFC
Common Stock converted in the Merger into the right to receive shares of such
BBandT Common Stock until the holder thereof has delivered properly endorsed
Old Certificates in exchange therefor in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 3.04. After becoming so entitled in accordance with this
Section 3.04, the record holder thereof also shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofor had become payable with respect to shares of BBandT Common Stock on
or after the Effective Date, and which such holder had the right to receive
upon surrender of the Old Certificates.

3.05 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event BBandT changes the number of
shares of BBandT Common Stock issued and outstanding between the date hereof
and the Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, split up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment or similar transaction and the record date therefor shall be
prior to the Effective Date, the Stock Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately
adjusted.



 

9 3.06 _Options_. (a) On the Effective Date, whether or not then exercisable,
each outstanding option to purchase shares of CFC Common Stock under the CFC
Stock Plans (each, a _"CFC Stock Option"_ ) shall be converted into and become
rights with respect to BBandT Common Stock, and BBandT shall assume each CFC Stock
Option in accordance with the terms of the CFC Stock Plans, except that from
and after the Effective Time (i) BBandT and its Compensation Committee shall be
substituted for CFC and the relevant committee of CFCs Board of Directors for
purposes of administering the CFC Stock Plans, (ii) each CFC Stock Option
assumed by BBandT may be exercised solely for shares of BBandT Common Stock, (iii)
the number of shares of BBandT Common Stock subject to each such CFC Stock
Option shall be the number of whole shares of BBandT Common Stock (omitting any
fractional share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of CFC Common
Stock subject to such CFC Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Stock Exchange Ratio, and (iv) the per share exercise price under each
such CFC Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise
price under each such CFC Stock Option by the Stock Exchange Ratio and
rounding up to the nearest cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BBandT may, at
its election, substitute as of the Effective Time options under the BBandT
Corporation 2004 Stock Incentive Plan or any other duly adopted comparable
plan (in either case, the " _BB andT Option Plan_") for all or a part of the
CFC Stock Options, subject to the following conditions: (A) the requirements
of (iii) and (iv) above shall be met; (B) such substitution shall not
constitute a modification, extension or renewal of any of the CFC Stock
Options; and (C) the substituted options shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions as provided in the CFC Stock Option Agreements and the
CFC Stock Plans governing each CFC Stock Option. BBandT shall cause each grant
of a converted or substitute option to any individual who subsequent to the
Merger will be a director or an officer of BBandT as construed under Rule 16b-3
of the Exchange Act shall, as a condition to such conversion or substitution,
to be approved in accordance with the provisions of Rule 16b-3. Each CFC Stock
Option that is an incentive stock option shall be adjusted as required by
Section 424 of the Code so as to continue as an incentive stock option under
Section 424(a) of the Code, and so as not to constitute a modification,
extension or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the
Code. Each CFC Stock Option that is intended to be exempt from
the application of Code Section 409A and related regulations or other
guidance shall be subject to adjustment as necessary in order to comply with
Prop. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D), or any successor provisions thereto.
BBandT and CFC agree to take all necessary steps to effectuate the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.06. BBandT has reserved and shall continue to
reserve adequate shares of BBandT Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of any
converted or substitute options. Within five (5) business days after the
Effective Date, if it has not already done so, BBandT shall file a registration
statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form), as the case may be, with respect to the shares of BBandT Common Stock
subject to converted or substitute options and shall use its reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such converted or substitute options remain
outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if any, who subsequent to the
Merger may be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act, BBandT shall administer the CFC Stock Plans assumed
pursuant to this Section 3.06 (or the BBandT Option Plan, if applicable) in a
manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the
extent necessary to preserve for such individuals the benefits of Rule 16b-3
to the extent such benefits were available to them prior to the Effective
Time. CFC hereby represents that the CFC Stock Plans in their current forms
comply with Rule 16b-3 to the extent, if any, required as of the date hereof.



 

10 (b) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, BBandT shall deliver to
the participants receiving converted options under the BBandT Option Plan an
appropriate written notice setting forth each participants rights pursuant
thereto.

(c) Eligibility to receive stock option grants following the Effective Time
with respect to BBandT Common Stock shall be determined by BBandT in accordance
with its plans and procedures as in effect from time to time, and subject to
any contractual obligations.

(ii) "Material Contracts" shall mean those contracts on CFCs Disclosure
Schedule listed under Section 5.03(k). All of the Material Contracts are in
full force and effect and are legal, valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with their terms (subject to the enforceability exceptions set
forth in Section 5.03(e)) (i) as to CFC or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, as the case may be, and (ii) to the knowledge of CFC, as to the
other parties to such Material Contracts. CFC and/or its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, as applicable, and to the knowledge of CFC, each other party to
the Material Contracts, has in all material respects performed and is
performing all obligations, conditions and covenants required to be performed
by it under the Material Contracts. Neither CFC nor any of its Subsidiaries
or affiliates, and to the knowledge of CFC, no other party, is in violation,
breach or default of any material obligation, condition or covenant under any
of the Material Contracts, and neither CFC nor any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, and to the knowledge of CFC, no other party, has received any
notice that any of the Material Contracts will be terminated or will not be
renewed. Neither CFC nor any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, has received
from or given to any other Person any notice of default or other violation
under any of the Material Contracts, nor, to the knowledge of CFC, does any
condition exist or has any event occurred which with notice or lapse of time
or both would constitute a default thereunder.

(l) _No Brokers_. No action has been taken by CFC that would give rise to any
valid claim against any party hereto for a brokerage commission, finders fee
or other like payment with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for a fee to be paid to Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc.

(m) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(i) Section 5.03(m)(i) of CFCs Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of all existing bonus, incentive, deferred compensation,
pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock
ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option,
severance, welfare and fringe benefit plans, employment or severance
agreements and all similar practices, policies and arrangements maintained
or contributed to by CFC or any of its Subsidiaries and in which any employee
or former employee (the _"Employees"_ ), consultant or former consultant (the
_"Consultants"_ ) or director or former director (the  _"Directors"_ ) of CFC
or any of its Subsidiaries participates or to which any such Employees,
Consultants or Directors are a party (the _"Compensation and Benefit Plans"_
). Neither CFC nor any of its Subsidiaries has any commitment to create any
additional Compensation and Benefit Plan or to  



 

21  modify or change any existing Compensation and Benefit Plan, except as
otherwise contemplated by Section 4.01(e) of this Agreement.

(ii) Each Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable law,
including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or any regulations or
rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and notices
required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely
made. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a _"Pension Plan"_ ) and
which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter (including a determination that the
related trust under such Compensation and Benefit Plan is exempt from tax
under Section 501(a) of the Code) from the Internal Revenue Service ( _"IRS"_
), and CFC is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of
any such favorable determination letter. There is no material pending or, to
the knowledge of CFC, threatened legal action, suit or claim relating to the
Compensation and Benefit Plans other than routine claims for benefits
thereunder. Neither CFC nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any Compensation
and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject CFC or any of
its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for purposes of Section 4975 of the
Code that the taxable period of any such transaction expired as of the date
hereof.

(iii) No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the PBGC which have
been made or will be made on a timely basis) under Title IV of ERISA has been
or is expected to be incurred by CFC or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
any of them, or any single-employer plan of any entity (an _"ERISA Affiliate"_
) which is considered one employer with CFC under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA
or Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code (an  _"ERISA Affiliate Plan"_ ). None of
CFC, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or has
been obligated to contribute, to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA at any time since September 26, 1980. No notice of a
"reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be
filed for any Compensation and Benefit Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate Plan
within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof, and no such notice will
be required to be filed as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Pension
Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan and, to CFCs knowledge, no condition exists that
presents a material risk that such proceedings will be instituted. To the
knowledge of CFC, there is no pending investigation or enforcement action by
the PBGC, the Department of Labor or IRS or any other governmental agency with
respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan. Under each Pension Plan and
ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of the date of the most recent actuarial valuation
performed prior to the date of this Agreement, the actuarially determined
present value of all  



 

22  "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA
(as determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such
actuarial valuation of such Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan), did not
exceed the then current value of the assets of such Pension Plan or ERISA
Affiliate Plan and since such date there has been neither an adverse change in
the financial condition of such Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any
amendment or other change to such Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan that
would increase the amount of benefits thereunder which reasonably could be
expected to change such result. 

(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Compensation
and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan have been timely made in cash or
have been reflected on the CFC Financial Statements as of September 30, 2006.
Neither any Pension Plan nor any ERISA Affiliate Plan has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and all required payments to the PBGC with
respect to each Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan have been made on or
before their due dates. None of CFC, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate (x) has provided, or would reasonably be expected to be required to
provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant
to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, and (y) has taken any action, or omitted
to take any action, that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to
result, in the imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or
pursuant to ERISA.

(v) Neither CFC nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations to provide
retiree health and life insurance or other retiree death benefits under any
Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B
of the Code. There has been no communication to Employees by CFC or any of its
Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such
Employees retiree health or life insurance or other retiree death benefits on
a permanent basis.

(vi) CFC and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any Compensation and Benefit
Plans covering foreign Employees.

(vii) With respect to each Compensation and Benefit Plan, if applicable, CFC
has provided or made available to BBandT true and complete copies of existing:
(A) Compensation and Benefit Plan documents and amendments thereto; (B) trust
instruments and insurance contracts; (C) two most recently filed Form 5500s;
(D) most recent actuarial report and financial statement; (E) the most recent
summary plan description; (F) forms filed with the PBGC within the past year
(other than for premium payments); (G) most recent determination letter
issued by the IRS; (H) any Form 5310 or Form 5330 filed with the IRS; (I) most
recent nondiscrimination tests performed under ERISA and the Code (including
401(k) and 401(m) tests); and (J) all top hat notices filed with the
Department of Labor.

(viii) Except as disclosed on Section 5.03(m)(viii) of CFCs Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
would not, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as a result
of any termination of  



 

23  employment prior to or following the Effective Time) reasonably be expected
to (A) entitle any Employee, Consultant or Director to any payment (including
severance pay or similar compensation) or any increase in compensation, (B)
result in the vesting or acceleration of any benefits under any Compensation
and Benefit Plan or (C) result in any material increase in benefits
payable under any Compensation and Benefit Plan.

(ix) Neither CFC nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains any compensation
plans, programs or arrangements the payments under which would not reasonably
be expected to be deductible as a result of the limitations under Section
162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder.

(x) Except as disclosed on Section 5.03(m)(x) of CFCs Disclosure Schedule, as
a result, directly or indirectly, of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, without limitation, as a result of any termination of
employment prior to or following the Effective Time), none of BBandT, CFC or the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be
obligated to make a payment that would be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" to an individual who is a "disqualified individual" (as
such terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code) of CFC on a consolidated
basis, without regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for
personal services performed or to be performed in the future.

(xi) Section 5.03(m)(xi) of CFCs Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Compensation and Benefit Plan that is or has ever been a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Code Section 409A and
associated Treasury Department guidance, including IRS Notice 2005-1 and
Proposed Treasury Regulations Sections 1.409A-1 _et seq._  (collectively
"409A") (each such plan a "NQDC Plan"). Except as provided in Section
5.03(m)(xi) of CFCs Disclosure Schedule, each NQDC Plan (i) has been
operated, notwithstanding any terms to the contrary, in full compliance with
409A as of January 1, 2005, (ii) has been operated and amended in full
compliance with 409A as of January 1, 2005, or (iii) does not provide for the
payment of any benefits that have been or will be deferred or vested after
December 31, 2004, and since October 3, 2004, has not been "materially
modified" within the meaning of 409A.

(xii) CFC has complied, and will comply, with the pass-through voting
requirements of Code Section 409(e).

(n) _Labor Matters_. Neither CFC nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement
or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is CFC or any
of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it or any such
Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the
National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel CFC or any such Subsidiary
to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of
employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute involving it or any
of its Subsidiaries pending or, to CFCs knowledge, threatened, nor is CFC
aware of any activity involving its or any of its Subsidiaries employees
seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in any other
organizational activity.



 

24 (o) _Takeover Laws_. CFC has taken all action required to be taken by it in
order to exempt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from,
and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from,
the requirements of any "moratorium"; "control share", "fair
price", "affiliate transaction", "business combination" or other antitakeover
laws and regulations of any state (collectively, _"Takeover Laws"_ )
applicable to it, including, without limitation, the State of Delaware.
CFC has taken all action required to be taken by it in order to make this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby comply with, and this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby do comply with, the
requirements of any Articles, Sections or provisions of CFCs Certificate or
Bylaws or its Subsidiaries Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws concerning
"business combination," "fair price," "voting requirement,"
"constituency requirement" or other related provisions (collectively, the
_"Takeover Provisions"_ ).

(p)  _Environmental Matters_. To CFCs knowledge, neither the conduct nor
operation of CFC or its Subsidiaries nor any condition of any property
presently or previously owned, leased or operated by any of them (including,
without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which any of
them holds a Lien, violates or violated Environmental Laws and to CFCs
knowledge, no condition has existed or event has occurred with respect to any
of them or any such property that, with notice or the passage of time, or
both, is reasonably likely to result in liability under Environmental Laws.
Neither CFC nor any of its Subsidiaries has used or stored any Hazardous
Material in, on, or at any property presently or previously owned, leased or

knowledge, neither CFC nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice
from any Person that CFC or its Subsidiaries or the operation or condition of
any property ever owned, leased, operated, or held as collateral or in a
fiduciary capacity by any of them are or were in violation of or otherwise are

entities and qualified special purpose entities, in which CFC or any of its
Subsidiaries or any officer or director of CFC or any of its Subsidiaries has

Schedule also sets forth a true and complete list of all transactions,
arrangements, and other relationships between or among any such CFC affiliated

substance; (ii) the key terms and conditions; (iii) the potential risk to CFC

on a consolidated basis, except as disclosed in the CFC Financial
Statements. 



 

27 (x) _Properties_. CFC and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title,
free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, charges, defaults or equitable

and payable, (ii) pledges to secure deposits and other liens incurred in the
ordinary course of banking business, (iii) such imperfections of title,
easements, encumbrances, liens, charges, defaults or equitable interests, if

the lessee or, to CFCs knowledge, the lessor.

 

(y) _Loans_. Each loan reflected as an asset in the CFC Financial Statements
and each balance sheet date subsequent thereto (i) is evidenced by notes,
agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine and what
they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by valid
liens and security interests that have been perfected, and (iii) is the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable

including any loan guaranty, with any director or officer (as defined in
Section 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) or 5% shareholder of CFC or any of
CFCs Subsidiaries or any Person controlling, controlled by or under common
control with any of the foregoing. All loans and extensions of credit that

Federal Reserve Act, as amended, or to Section 563.43 of the rules and
regulations promulgated by the OTS, comply therewith.

(z) _Allowance for Loan Losses_. In the opinion of CFCs management, the

(dd) _Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC and Customer
Information_. CFC is not aware of, has not been advised of, and has no reason
to believe that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause it or any
of its Subsidiaries to be deemed (i) to be operating in violation in any
material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order
issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the
Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-
money laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (ii) not to be in
satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy
and customer information requirements contained in any federal and state
privacy laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in Title V of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as
well as the provisions of the information security program adopted by CFC
pursuant to 12 C.F.R Part 40. CFC is not aware of any facts or circumstances
that would cause it to believe that any non-public customer information has
been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner that
would cause it or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any material remedial
action. The CFC Board (or, where appropriate, the board of directors of any of
CFCs Subsidiaries) has adopted and implemented an anti-money laundering
program that contains adequate and appropriate customer identification
verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the Patriot Act and
such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements in all material
respects of Section 352 of the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder, and
it (or such other of its Subsidiaries) has complied in all material respects
with any requirements to file reports and other necessary documents as
required by the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder.

(ee) _No Right to Dissent._  Nothing in the CFC Certificate or the Bylaws of
CFC or any of its Subsidiaries provides or would provide to any Person,
including without limitation the holders of CFC Common Stock, upon execution
of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, rights of dissent and appraisal of any kind.

(ff) _Sarbanes-Oxley Act._  CFC is in compliance with the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including Section 404 thereof, and the certifications
provided and to be provided pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 thereof are
accurate.

(gg) _SEC Documents._ CFCs Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years
ended September 30, 2004, 2005 and 2006, and all other reports, registration
statements, definitive proxy statements or information statements filed by it
or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to September 30, 2006 under the
Securities Act, or under Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, in the form filed with the SEC (collectively, _"CFC SEC Documents"_ ) as
of the date filed, (A) were timely filed and complied in all material respects
as to form with the applicable requirements under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

regulation or any judgment, decree, order, governmental permit or license, or
agreement, indenture or instrument of BBandT or of any of its Subsidiaries or
to which BBandT or any of its Subsidiaries or properties is subject or bound,
(B) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under, the Articles of

Covenants

6.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of CFC and BBandT agrees to use its reasonable best efforts in
good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under
applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as
practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof, and shall cooperate fully with the other
party hereto to that end.

6.02 _Shareholder Approval._ CFC agrees to take, in accordance with applicable
law and the CFC Certificate and CFC Bylaws, all action necessary to convene
an appropriate meeting of its shareholders to consider and vote upon the
adoption of this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved or
adopted by CFCs shareholders for consummation of  



 

32  the Merger (including any adjournment or postponement, the _"CFC Meeting"_
), as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective. The CFC Board shall recommend that its shareholders adopt this
Agreement at the CFC Meeting unless the CFC Board, after consultation with
independent legal counsel, determines in good faith that it is probable that
such recommendation would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Delaware law.

6.03 _Registration Statement._ (a) BBandT agrees to prepare, pursuant to all
applicable laws, rules and regulations, a registration statement on Form S-4
(the _"Registration Statement"_ ) to be filed by BBandT with the SEC in
connection with the issuance of BBandT Common Stock in the Merger (including
the proxy statement and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of
CFC constituting a part thereof (the _"Proxy Statement"_ ) and all related
documents). CFC agrees to cooperate, and to cause its Subsidiaries to
cooperate, with BBandT, its counsel and its accountants, in preparation of the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement; and provided that CFC and its
Subsidiaries have cooperated as required above, BBandT agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to file the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement
(together, the _"Proxy/Prospectus"_ ) with the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Each of CFC and BBandT agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
cause the Proxy/Prospectus to be declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing thereof. BBandT also agrees
to use all reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of
the Registration Statement, all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. CFC agrees to furnish to BBandT all information concerning CFC,
its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and shareholders as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the foregoing.

(b) Each of CFC and BBandT agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none
of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, and at the Effective Time, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and (ii) the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto will, at the date of mailing to the CFC shareholders and at the time
of the CFC Meeting, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or any statement
which, in the light of the circumstances under which such statement is made,
will be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which will
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any
earlier statement in the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto. Each of CFC and BBandT further agrees that if it shall become aware
prior to the Effective Date of any information furnished by it that would
cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly
inform the other party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the
Proxy Statement.

(c) BBandT agrees to advise CFC, promptly after BBandT receives notice thereof,
of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or  



 

33  amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the
suspension of the qualification of BBandT Common Stock for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the
Registration Statement or for additional information.

6.04 _Press Releases._ Each of CFC and BBandT agrees that it will not, without
the prior approval of the other party, issue any press release or written
statement for general circulation relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, except as otherwise required by applicable law or regulation or NYSE
or NASDAQ rules.

6.05 _Access; Information._ Except as Previously Disclosed, (a) CFC agrees
that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, it shall afford BBandT and BBandTs officers, employees,
counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives, such access during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to
the books, records (including, without limitation, tax returns and, to the
extent practicable, work papers of independent auditors), properties,
personnel and to such other information as BBandT may reasonably request and,
during such period, it shall furnish promptly to BBandT (i) a copy of each
material report, schedule and other document filed by CFC pursuant to federal
or state securities or banking laws, and (ii) all other information concerning
the business, properties and personnel of CFC as BBandT may reasonably request.

(b) Each of BBandT and CFC agrees that it will not, and will cause its
representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.05 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in
connection with the entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to the requirements of law, each party will keep
confidential, and will cause its representatives to keep confidential, all
information and documents obtained pursuant to this Section 6.05 (as well as
any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the
entering into of this Agreement) unless such information (i) was already known
to such party, (ii) becomes available to such party from other sources not
known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is
disclosed with the prior written approval of the party to which such
information pertains or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable from
published information or trade sources. No investigation by either party of
the business and affairs of the other shall affect or be deemed to modify or
waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement,
or the conditions to either partys obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
CFC shall promptly furnish BBandT with copies of all monthly and other interim
financial statements produced in the ordinary course of business as the same
shall become available.

6.06 _Acquisition Proposals._ CFC agrees that it shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, advisors
and affiliates not to, solicit or encourage inquiries or proposals with
respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential information to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, except to the extent that the CFC
Board, after consultation with independent legal counsel, determines in good
faith that it is probable that the failure to take such  



 

34  action would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Delaware
law. It shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of this
Agreement with any parties other than BBandT with respect to any of the
foregoing and shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. CFC
shall promptly advise BBandT following the receipt by CFC of any Acquisition
Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal), and advise BBandT of any material
developments with respect to such Acquisition Proposal promptly upon the
occurrence thereof.

6.07 _Affiliate Agreements._ Not later than the 15th day prior to the mailing
of the Proxy Statement, CFC shall deliver to BBandT a schedule of each Person
that, to the best of its knowledge, is or is reasonably likely to be, as of
the date of the CFC Meeting, deemed to be an "affiliate" of CFC (each, a
_"CFC Affiliate"_ ) as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act.
CFC shall cause each Person who may be deemed to be a CFC Affiliate to execute
and deliver to CFC on or before the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement an
agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_. CFC shall deliver such
executed affiliate agreements to BBandT at the Closing.

6.08 _Takeover Laws._ No party hereto shall take any action that would cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or, if necessary, challenge
the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or
hereafter in effect. Neither party will take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated hereby not to comply with any Takeover Provisions
and each of them will take all necessary steps within its control to make
those transactions comply with (or continue to comply with) the Takeover
Provisions.

6.09 _Reports._ Each of CFC and BBandT shall file (and shall cause CFCs
Subsidiaries and BBandTs Subsidiaries, respectively, to file), between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, all reports required to be filed by
it with the SEC and any other Regulatory Authorities having jurisdiction over
such party, and CFC shall deliver to BBandT copies of all such reports promptly
after the same are filed. If financial statements are contained in any such
reports filed with the SEC, such financial statements will fairly present the
consolidated financial position of the entity filing such statements as of the
dates indicated and the consolidated results of operations, changes
in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the periods then ended in
accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim financial statements to
the absence of notes and to normal recurring year-end adjustments that are not
material). As of their respective dates, such reports filed with the SEC will
comply in all material respects with the Federal securities laws and will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Any financial statements contained in any reports to a
Regulatory Authority shall be prepared in accordance with requirements
applicable to such reports.

6.10 _Exchange Listing_. BBandT will use all reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of BBandT Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event before the Effective Time.



 

35 6.11 _Regulatory Applications._ (a) BBandT and CFC and their respective
Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts
to prepare all documentation, to timely effect all filings and to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that it will consult
with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all material
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other party
apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party or
Governmental Authority.

6.12 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses._ (a) Following the
Effective Date, BBandT shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and advance
expenses to) the present directors, officers and employees of CFC and its
Subsidiaries (each, an _"Indemnified Party"_ ) against all costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring on or prior to
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent that CFC is permitted to
indemnify (and advance expenses to) its directors, officers and employees
under the laws of the State of Delaware, the CFC Certificate and the CFC
Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof.

(b) For a period of three years from the Effective Time, BBandT shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide that portion of directors and officers
liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers
and directors of CFC or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to claims against
such directors and officers arising from facts or events that occurred before
the Effective Time, on terms no less favorable than those in effect on
the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that BBandT may substitute therefor
policies providing at least comparable coverage containing terms and
conditions no less favorable than those in effect on the date hereof; and
_provided, further_ , that officers and directors of CFC or any Subsidiary
may be required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to BBandTs insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such
insurance; and _provided, further_ , in no event shall the annual premium on
such policy exceed 125% of the annual premium payments on CFCs policy in
effect as of the date hereof (the _"Maximum Amount"_ ). If the amount of the
premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, BBandT shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors and officers liability insurance
obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.



 

36 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.12(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify BBandT thereof; provided
that the failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of BBandT under
Section 6.12(a) unless and to the extent that BBandT is actually prejudiced as
a result of such failure.

(d) If BBandT or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any entity, then and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of BBandT shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.12.

6.13 _Employment Agreements; 401(k) Plan; Other Employee Benefits._ (a) As of
the date hereof, BBandT (or its specified Subsidiary) shall enter into a seven-
year employment/consulting agreement with Michael C. Gerald (the 
_"Employment/Consulting Agreement"_ ), which shall become effective on the
Effective Date if the Closing occurs as provided in Section 2.04 of this
Agreement.

(b) No later than the Effective Time, CFC shall take such steps as may be
necessary to fully vest all participants in the 401(k) plan of CFC. Effective
on the Benefit Plan Determination Date with respect to the 401(k) plan of CFC,
BBandT shall cause such plan to be merged with the BBandT Corporation 401(k)
Savings Plan (the _"BB andT 401(k) Plan"_), or to be frozen or to be
terminated, in each case as determined by BBandT and subject to and conditional
upon the receipt of all applicable regulatory or governmental approvals. Each
employee of CFC at the Effective Time (i) who is a participant in the 401(k)
plan of CFC, (ii) who becomes an employee of BBandT or of any of its
Subsidiaries (the _"Employer Entity"_ ) immediately following the Effective
Time, and (iii) who continues in the employment of an Employer Entity until
the Benefit Plan Determination Date for the BBandT 401(k) Plan, shall be
eligible to participate in the BBandT 401(k) Plan as of the Benefit Plan
Determination Date. Any other employee of CFC who is employed by an Employer
Entity on or after the Benefit Plan Determination Date shall be eligible to
be a participant in the BBandT 401(k) Plan upon complying with eligibility
requirements. All rights to participate in the BBandT 401(k) Plan are subject to
BBandTs right to amend or terminate the plan. Until the Benefit Plan
Determination Date, BBandT shall continue in effect, for the benefit of
participating employees, the 401(k) plan of CFC. For purposes of administering
the BBandT 401(k) Plan, service with CFC and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed
to be service with BBandT for participation and vesting purposes, but not for
purposes of benefit accrual. Any compensation earned and deferred by employees
of CFC in the calendar year of the Benefit Plan Determination Date will be
recognized by BBandT in the administration of the BBandT 401(k) Plan.
Additionally, employees of CFC will be eligible to receive from BBandT in the
administration of the BBandT 401(k) Plan any matching contribution received by
such employees as a participant in the 401(k) Plan of CFC. Each employee of
CFC or its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time who becomes an employee
immediately following the Effective Time of an Employer Entity is referred to
here as a  _"Transferred Employee."_

(c) Each Transferred Employee shall be eligible to participate in
group hospitalization, medical, dental, life, disability and other welfare
benefit plans and programs available to employees of the Employer Entity,
subject to the terms of such plans and programs,  



 

37  as of the Benefit Plan Determination Date for each such plan or program,
conditional upon the Transferred Employees being employed by an
Employer Entity as of such Benefit Plan Determination Date and subject to
complying with eligibility requirements of the respective plans and programs.
With respect to any welfare benefit plan or program of CFC that the Employer
Entity determines, in its sole discretion, provides benefits of the same type
or class as a corresponding plan or program maintained by an Employer Entity,
the Employer Entity shall continue such CFC plan or program in effect for the
benefit of the Transferred Employees so long as they remain eligible to
participate and until they shall become eligible to become participants in the
corresponding plan or program maintained by the Employer Entity (and, with
respect to any such plan or program, subject to complying with eligibility
requirements and subject to the right of the Employer Entity to terminate such
plan or program). For purposes of administering the welfare plans and programs
subject to this Section 6.13, service with CFC shall be deemed to be service
with the Employer Entity for the purpose of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting (if applicable) in such welfare plans and programs,
but not for the purpose of computing benefits, if any, determined in whole or
in part with reference to service (except as otherwise provided in Section
6.13(d)).

(d) Except to the extent of commitments herein or other contractual
commitments, if any, specifically made or assumed hereunder by BBandT, neither
BBandT nor any Employer Entity shall have any obligation arising from the Merger
to continue any Transferred Employees in its employ or in any specific job or
to provide to any Transferred Employee any specified level of compensation or
any incentive payments, benefits or perquisites. Each Transferred Employee who
is terminated by an Employer Entity subsequent to the Effective
Time, excluding any employee who has a then existing contract explicitly
providing for severance in lieu of severance plan benefits, shall be entitled
to severance pay in accordance with the Coastal Federal Bank Change in Control
Severance Compensation Plan (the "Bank Severance Plan") if and to the extent
that such Transferred Employee is entitled to severance pay under the Bank
Severance Plan. Each Transferred Employees service with BBandT shall be treated
as service with CFC for purposes of determining the amount of severance pay,
if any, under the Bank Severance Plan.

(e) BBandT agrees to honor all employment agreements, severance agreements and
deferred compensation agreements that CFC and its Subsidiaries have with their
current and former employees and directors and which have been Previously
Disclosed to BBandT pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent any such
agreements shall be superseded or terminated at the Closing or following the
Effective Date. BBandT acknowledges and agrees that (i) each CFC employee
covered by a Previously Disclosed CFC or CFC Affiliate employment agreement
shall be entitled to a severance payment and continuation of employee benefits
under the applicable change in control severance provisions of such agreement
without regard to whether such officer continues employment with BBandT after
the Effective Date as a Transferred Employee, provided each such CFC employee
executes an acknowledgment of payment and release of obligations under his or
her existing employment agreement (in a form acceptable to BBandT), and (ii)
such payment shall be made by BBandT not later than the first to occur of (x)
the officers voluntary or involuntary termination of employment or (y) the
date that is 120 days after the Effective Date without regard to whether such
employee is still employed by BBandT as of such date; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not apply to an employee covered by a Previously Disclosed
CFC or CFC Affiliate employment agreement who enters into a new
employment agreement  



 

38  with BBandT. Except for the agreements described in the preceding sentence and
except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.13, the employee benefit plans
of CFC shall, in the sole discretion of BBandT, be frozen, terminated or merged
into comparable plans of BBandT, effective as BBandT shall determine in its sole
discretion. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, BBandT will
continue in effect any short-term bonus plans of CFC (the _"CFC Bonus
Arrangements"_ ) until, as determined by BBandT, (i) the date of completion of
conversion of the data services systems of CFC and its Subsidiaries to
the data service systems of BBandT and its Subsidiaries, (ii) the date that
former CFC executives are made parties to the BBandT Amended and Restated Short
Term Incentive Plan, or (iii) the date the former CFC employees are made
parties to the applicable line of business incentive plan (each of the BBandT
Amended and Restated Short Term Incentive Plan and the applicable line of
business incentive plan shall referred to herein as a _"BB andT Bonus Plan"_).
If any former employee of CFC would earn amounts under both the CFC Bonus
Arrangements and the applicable BBandT Bonus Plan for any calendar year, BBandT
shall make appropriate adjustments in the amounts earned under such programs
to avoid duplication and to pro-rate the amount earned by such employee under
the CFC Bonus Arrangements and the applicable BBandT Bonus Plan for the portion
of the year in which such employee participated in each such plan.

(f) CFC will enter into retention bonus arrangements (in such amounts and upon
such terms and conditions as BBandT shall specify) with such key employees of
CFC and its Subsidiaries as are requested or approved by BBandT.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall either (i)
constitute an amendment to an existing Compensation and Benefit Plan of CFC or
BBandT, or (ii) constitute the creation of a new Compensation and Benefit Plan
for either CFC or BBandT. 

6.14 _Notification of Certain Matters._ Each of CFC and BBandT shall give prompt
notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i)
is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts,
events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect
with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.

6.15 _Dividend Coordination._ It is agreed by the parties hereto that they
will cooperate to assure that as a result of the Merger, during any applicable
period, there shall not be a payment of both a BBandT and a CFC dividend. The
parties further agree that if the Effective Date is at the end of a fiscal
quarter, then they will cooperate to assure that the CFC shareholders receive
the dividend declared by BBandT, if any, rather than the dividend for that
period, if any, declared by CFC.

 

6.16 _Advisory Board._ Each of the current members of the CFC Board will be
asked to serve on a BBandT local advisory board for the region formerly served
by CFC, and BBandT will pay compensation to such directors for their service on
such BBandT local advisory board consistent with the existing fee structure
offered by CFC to such directors for a period of two years after the
Effective Date. After the expiration of such two-year period, BBandT will pay
compensation to such directors for their service on such BBandT local advisory
board consistent with BBandTs fee policies and age limits for advisory
board members. Any board member who  



 

39  agrees to serve on such BBandT local advisory board shall enter into a two-
year noncompete agreement, which shall commence on the Effective Date. 

6.17 _Tax Treatment._ Each of BBandT and CFC agrees not to take any actions
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would adversely affect the
ability of CFC and its shareholders to characterize the Merger as a tax-free
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, and each of BBandT and CFC
agrees to take such action as may be reasonably required, if such action may
be reasonably taken to reverse the impact of any past actions that would
adversely impact the ability for the Merger to be characterized as a tax-free
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

6.18 _No Breaches of Representations and Warranties._ Between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, without the written consent of the other
party, each of BBandT and CFC will not do any act or suffer any omission of any
nature whatsoever that would cause any of the representations or warranties
made in Article V of this Agreement to become untrue or incorrect in
any material respect.

6.19 _Consents._ Each of BBandT and CFC shall use its best efforts to obtain any
required consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.20 _Insurance Coverage._ CFC shall cause each of the policies of
insurance listed in its Disclosure Schedule to remain in effect between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Date.

6.21 _Correction of Information._ Each of BBandT and CFC shall promptly correct
and supplement any information furnished under this Agreement so that such
information shall be correct and complete in all material respects at all
times, and shall include all facts necessary to make such information correct
and complete in all material respects at all times, provided that any such
correction that may result in a change to a partys Disclosure Schedule shall
not be made without the prior written consent of the other party.

6.22 _Confidentiality._ Except for the use of information in connection with
the Registration Statement described in Section 6.03 hereof and any other
governmental filings required in order to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, all information (collectively, the
_"Information"_ ) received by each of CFC and BBandT, pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement shall be kept in strictest confidence; _provided that_ ,
subsequent to the filing of the Registration Statement with the SEC, this
Section 6.22 shall not apply to information included in the Registration
Statement or to be included in the official Proxy/Prospectus to be sent to the
shareholders of CFC under Section 6.03. CFC and BBandT agree that the
Information will be used only for the purpose of completing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. CFC and BBandT agree to hold the Information in
strictest confidence and shall not use, and shall not disclose directly or
indirectly any of such Information except when, after and to the extent
such Information (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other
than through the failure of CFC or BBandT to fulfill its obligations hereunder,
(ii) was already known to the party receiving the Information on a
nonconfidential basis prior to the disclosure or (iii) is subsequently
disclosed to the party receiving the Information on a nonconfidential basis by
a third party having no obligation of confidentiality to the party disclosing
the Information. It is agreed and  



 

40  understood that the obligations of CFC and BBandT contained in this Section
6.22 shall survive the Closing. It is also agreed and understood that to the
extent the terms of this Section 6.22 differ from or are inconsistent with the
terms of Section 6.05(b), this Section 6.22 and Section 6.05(b) shall be read
together so as to afford the broadest scope of intended confidentiality.

(a) _Mutual Consent._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual
consent of BBandT and CFC.

(b) _Breach._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by BBandT or CFC in the
event of either: (i) a breach by the other party of any representation or
warranty contained herein (subject to the standard set forth in Section 5.02),
which breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving
of written notice to the breaching party of such breach; or (ii) a breach by
the other party of any of the covenants or agreements contained herein, which
breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of
written notice to the breaching party of such breach, _provided that_ (A)
such breach (under either clause (i) or (ii)) would entitle the non-breaching
party not to consummate the Merger under Article VII, and (B) the terminating
party is not itself in material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

(c) _Delay._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by BBandT or CFC, if its
Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its
entire Board, in the event that the Merger is not consummated by October 1,
2007, except to the extent that the failure of the Merger then to be
consummated arises out of or results from the knowing action or inaction of
the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01(c).

(d) _No Approval._ By CFC or BBandT in the event (i) the approval of any
Governmental Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied by final
nonappealable action of such Governmental Authority or an application
therefore shall have been permanently withdrawn at the invitation, request or
suggestion of a Governmental Authority; (ii) the CFC shareholders fail to
adopt this Agreement at the CFC Meeting and approve the Merger; or (iii) any
of the closing conditions have not been met as required by Article VII hereof.

(e)  _Adverse Action._ By BBandT, if (i) the CFC Board submits this Agreement
(or the plan of merger contained herein) to its shareholders without a
recommendation for approval or with any adverse conditions on, or
qualifications of, such recommendation for approval; or (ii) the CFC Board
otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or discloses its
intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its recommendation
referred to in Section 6.02; or (iii) the CFC Board recommends to its
shareholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.



 

43 8.02 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment; Enforcement of Agreement._ In the
event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger
pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall have any
liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder except (i) as set
forth in Sections 8.03 and 9.01; and (ii) that termination will not relieve a
breaching party from liability or damages for any willful breach of this
Agreement giving rise to such termination. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage will
occur in the event that a party breaches any of its obligations, duties,
covenants and agreements contained herein. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any
state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled by law or in equity.

8.03 _Termination Fee._ CFC shall pay to BBandT a termination fee in the amount
of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) if:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by BBandT pursuant to Section 8.01(b) or
8.01(e) or by BBandT or CFC pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii), and (a) prior to
such termination, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to CFC was commenced,
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed and (b) within 18 months after such
termination, CFC shall have entered into an agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated;
_or_

(ii) after receiving an Acquisition Proposal, the CFC Board does not take
action to convene the CFC Meeting and/or recommend that CFC shareholders
adopt this Agreement, and within 18 months after such receipt, CFC shall have
entered into an agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any
Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated.

Upon payment of the fee described in this Section 8.03, CFC shall have no
further liability to BBandT at law or in equity with respect to
such termination under Section 8.01(b), 8.01(d)(ii) or 8.01(e), or with
respect to the CFC Boards failure to take action to convene the CFC Meeting
and/or recommend that CFC shareholders adopt this Agreement. CFC acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03 are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, BBandT would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if CFC
fails to pay timely any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.03 and, in
order to obtain such payment, BBandT commences a suit that results in a judgment
against CFC for the amount payable to BBandT pursuant to this Section 8.03, CFC
shall pay to BBandT its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
so payable at the applicable Federal Funds rate.

48 _Exhibit A_

_Form of CFC Affiliate Agreement_

_ _, 2007

BBandT Corporation

200 West Second Street

Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27101

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Coastal Financial Corporation ("CFC"), as that term is defined
for purposes of Paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules
and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act").

Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between BBandT
Corporation ("BBandT") and Coastal Financial Corporation dated as of December
20, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement"), providing for the merger of CFC with and
into BBandT (the "Merger"), and as a result of the Merger, I may receive shares
of BBandT common stock ("BBandT Common Shares") in exchange for shares of CFC
common stock ("CFC Stock") owned by me at the Effective Time (as defined and
determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement). This letter is being delivered
pursuant to Section 6.07 of the Merger Agreement. I represent and warrant to
BBandT that in such event:

A. I will not sell, assign or transfer the BBandT Common Shares that I receive
as aforesaid in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

B. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and have
discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability
to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the BBandT Common Shares, to the
extent I feel necessary, with my counsel or counsel for CFC. I understand
that BBandT is relying on the representations I am making in this letter and I
hereby agree to hold harmless and indemnify BBandT and its officers and
directors from and against any losses, claims, damages, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), or liabilities ("Losses") to which
BBandT or any officer or director of BBandT may become subject under the Act or
otherwise as a result of the untruth, breach, or failure of such
representations. 

C. I have been advised that the issuance of the BBandT Common Shares issued to
me pursuant to the Merger will have been registered with the Commission under
the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been
advised that since I may be deemed to be an affiliate under the Rules and
Regulations at the time the Merger    was submitted for a vote of the shareholders of CFC, that the BBandT Common
Shares must be held by me indefinitely unless (i) my subsequent distribution
of BBandT Common Shares has been registered under the Act; (ii) a sale of the
BBandT Common Shares is made in conformity with the volume and other applicable
limitations of a transaction permitted by Rule 145 promulgated by
the Commission under the Act and as to which BBandT has received satisfactory
evidence of the compliance and conformity with said Rule, or (iii) a
transaction in which, in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to BBandT
or in accordance with a no-action letter from the Commission, some other
exemption from registration is available with respect to any such proposed
sale, transfer or other disposition of the BBandT Common Shares.

D. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to BBandTs
transfer agent with respect to any BBandT Common Shares which I receive in the
Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates for such BBandT Common
Shares, a legend stating in substance:

"The shares represented by this certificate have been issued or transferred to
the registered holder as a result of a transaction to which Rule 145 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), applies. The shares
represented by this certificate may not be sold, transferred or assigned, and
the issuer shall not be required to give effect to any attempted sale,
transfer or assignment, except pursuant to (i) an effective registration
statement under the Act, (ii) a transaction permitted by Rule 145 and as to
which the issuer has received reasonable and satisfactory evidence of
compliance with the provisions of Rule 145, or (iii) a transaction in which,
in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the issuer or in accordance with a
"no action" letter from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
such shares are not required to be registered under the Act."

 



 

A-2 It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth in Paragraph D above
shall be removed and any stop order instructions with respect thereto shall
be canceled upon receipt of advice from counsel satisfactory to BBandT that such
actions are appropriate under the then-existing circumstances.
