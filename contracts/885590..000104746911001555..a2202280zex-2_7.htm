 **ARTICLE 2 
THE TRANSACTION**

 



 

 _Section 2.1_ _Purchase and Sale_. In accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, the Sellers will sell and transfer to the
Purchaser, and the Purchaser will purchase and acquire from the Sellers, all
of the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

 



 

 _Section 2.2_ _Closing Consideration_. The Closing Consideration for the
Shares (the " _Closing Consideration_ ") is EUR 350,000,000, and shall
(subject to the deductions according to Section 2.4) be paid to the Sellers as
set out in _Exhibit 2.2_ hereto. The Closing Consideration is subject to
adjustment in accordance with Section 2.3 and Section 2.4.

 



 

 _Section 2.3_ _Additional Consideration_. The Additional Consideration to be
paid on 31 May 2012 to the Founders as set out in _Exhibit 2.3_ (the "
_Additional Consideration_ ") amounts to:

 



 

(a) EUR *****, if, on a consolidated basis applying IFRS in consistency with
past practices of the Company, the net revenues (as defined below) of the
license and representation businesses to be determined consistent with the
CompanyÂ’s classification for the purpose of the CompanyÂ’s 2011 budget as
contained in the Data Room, of the Company on a consolidated basis for the
full calendar year 2011 reach ***** of the net revenues of these businesses
achieved for the full calendar year 2010 (and EUR *****, if such net revenues
for the full calendar year 2011 are ***** of such net revenues for the full
calendar year 2010); and

 



 

(b) between EUR ***** and EUR *****, whereby the specific amount is determined
such that for each Euro the net revenues (as defined below) of the Company for
the full calendar year 2011 exceed EUR *****, the Founders (together) shall
receive ***** of one Euro up to an amount of EUR ***** (the " _Earnout
Payment_ "). The net revenues of the Company for the full calendar year 2011
are determined on a consolidated basis applying IFRS in consistency with past
practice of the Company. Eurocents shall be rounded up or down.

 



 

For the purpose of this clause (b), the net revenues shall also include net
revenues (without duplication) from future acquisitions by the Acquired
Companies if such acquisition is with respect to products being purchased or
products that are in-licensed for an initial term of ***** or with respect to
representation business acquisitions if the initial term is ***** (" _Included
Acquisitions_ "), but shall exclude net revenues for acquisitions (except for
net revenues from products from existing license agreements with a company
listed in _Exhibit 2.3(b)_ , in existence at the date of such acquisition)
that, at the date of this Agreement, form part of the acquisition pipeline of
the group of companies of the Purchaser as set out in _Exhibit 2.3(b)_ hereto
or relate to business that do not meet the criteria of the Included
Acquisitions. In determining the net revenues attributable to Included
Acquisitions, net revenues shall be *****, provided that clause (ii) only
applies to in-licensed or purchased products (that have not yet been
commercialized or do not have commercially meaningful sales yet).

 



 

Additionally, for the purpose of this clause (b), the net revenues (without
duplication) shall also include net revenues from future acquisitions by the
Acquired Companies if any such acquisition is with respect to representation
business acquisitions and if the initial term is *****, whereby net revenues
shall be ***** regarding such products forming part of the acquisitions
referred to in this paragraph, provided

 



      
 

 



 

that clause (ii) only applies to in-licensed or purchased products (that have
not yet been commercialized or do not have commercially meaningful sales yet).

 



 

Any acquisition only counts as additional net revenues if such acquisition has
been approved in accordance with the internal procedures of the Acquired
Companies and by the ParentÂ’s general counsel. No renewals of existing
contracts for existing products in existing territories of the Acquired
Companies shall be construed as an acquisition for the purposes of the two
preceding paragraphs.

 



 

For the purpose of clarity, in the event that any of the Acquired Companies is
constrained from launching an approved product (meaning having a marketing
authorization) containing the exact same compound for each of the territories
which is already planned in the CompanyÂ’s 2011 budget (as set out in the Data
Room) (i) because a product of any Affiliate of Purchaser is already on the
market (prior to the Closing Date) in that territory, then the net revenues of
***** of the Affiliate of Purchaser for such territory shall be added to net
revenues, or (ii) because a product of any Affiliate of Purchaser is launched
in that territory, then the net revenues of ***** shall be is regarded as net
revenues for the purpose of the second and third paragraph of this clause (b).

 



 

Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct any amounts ***** from the Earnout
Payment, to the extent the Earnout Payment exceeds ***** million.

 



 

In case of breach of Section 5.8(A) by any of the Founders or Executives, no
Founder shall be eligible for any Earnout Payment hereunder.

 



 

The Purchaser agrees that it will consider in good faith, but under no
obligation, to also include net revenues from *****, in an amount ***** that
need to be achieved according to the respective contracts regarding such
products.

 



 

For the purpose of clauses (a) and (b) above, net revenue shall be (A) all
third-party sales in the ordinary course of business (B) minus (i) customer
directed commissions and quantity, trade and cash discounts; (ii) discounts,
replacements, credits or refunds for the return of recalled, rejected,
outdated, damaged or returned products, and other negative sales revenue
items; (iii) rebates, chargebacks and price adjustments; (iv) sales or similar
taxes (including duties or other governmental charges or assessments) levied,
absorbed, or otherwise imposed on the sale of products (including VAT or other
governmental charges measured by the billing amount, when included in such
billing); and (v) actual bad debt and (C) adjusted for any changes in cost or
revenue allocation practices from 2010 to 2011 that would, without adjustment,
reduce comparability of the net revenues for the full calendar year 2010 and
those for the full calendar year 2011, and revenue recognition shall be done
in accordance with IFRS according to past practice of the Company. The
payments of any Additional Consideration under clauses (a) and (b) above shall
be separate and not mutually exclusive, with either or both payments
achievable if the applicable thresholds are achieved.

 



 

Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct from the payment of any Additional
Consideration (and thereby to reduce such consideration by) an amount of up to
EUR ***** (but not more than *****) should *****, except if Purchaser
determines, in its sole and unlimited discretion, that it would not suffer any
*****. For avoidance of doubt, the deduction contemplated by the preceding
sentence is in addition to and separate from the EUR ***** put into the Old
Reserve Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 2.4(b) and can only be made to
the extent, *****.

 



 

Purchaser shall procure that already in 2011 and, insofar as necessary,
thereafter Founders are granted reasonable access to the Acquired Companies to
inspect all documents reasonably necessary to be inspected for determining the
Additional Consideration. The Founders may also use an accountant to inspect
such documents, provided the accountant signs a customary confidentiality
agreement with the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 2.4_ _Escrow Funds_. The following amounts shall be deducted from
the Closing Consideration of Seller 1, Seller 2, Seller 3, and Seller 5 (the "
_Sellers-IV_ ") as set out in _Exhibit 2.4_ and shall only be paid as set out
below:

 



 

(a) EUR *****. This amount shall be deposited at Closing in an escrow account
(the " _Working Capital Escrow Fund_ ") pursuant to the Escrow Agreements
attached hereto as _Exhibit 2.4(a)_ (together the " _Escrow Agreements_ ").
Payment of said amount shall be made as follows:

 



 

(i) Within 30 days of the Closing, Purchaser shall calculate the difference
between the Net Working Capital as reflected in the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet and the Reference Balance Sheet. If the Net Working Capital as per the
Reference Balance Sheet exceeds the Net Working Capital as per the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet, Purchaser shall be paid such difference from the
Working Capital Escrow Fund, *****. If the Net Working Capital as per the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet exceeds the Net Working Capital as per the
Reference Balance Sheet the difference shall be paid by the Purchaser to *****
as set out in _Exhibit 2.4_ , *****. Any payment pursuant to this clause (i)
shall be referred to as the " _Preliminary Working Capital Adjustment_ ".

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall calculate the difference between the Net Working Capital
as reflected in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Trued Up Balance
Sheet. If the Net Working Capital as per the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
exceeds the Net Working Capital as per the Trued Up Balance Sheet, Purchaser
shall be paid such difference from the Working Capital Escrow Fund. If the Net
Working Capital as per the Trued Up Balance Sheet exceeds the Net Working
Capital as per the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet the difference shall be
paid by the Purchaser to the ***** as set out in _Exhibit 2.4_. There shall be
no cap applicable to any such payments, and to the extent the Preliminary
Working Capital Adjustment was reduced because of the cap set forth in clause
(i) above, such amount shall be included in the payment under this clause (ii)
to the extent required to reflect the difference between the Net Working
Capital set forth in the Trued Up Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital
set forth in the Reference Balance Sheet. To the extent that the Working
Capital Escrow Fund is insufficient to pay any working capital adjustment,
Purchaser shall be entitled to claim such amounts against the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, and to the extent Purchaser made a payment under clause (i) above, but
is entitled to receive a payment under this clause (ii), Purchaser may also
claim payment from each ***** for such SellersÂ’ portion. Any payment to be
made pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be referred to as the " _Trued Up
Working Capital Adjustment_ " and shall forthwith be made upon final
determination of the Trued Up Working Capital Adjustment.

 



 

For the determination of the Trued Up Working Capital Adjustment the following
procedure shall apply:

 



 

(1) Within ***** days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will prepare and
deliver to each of the ***** written notice (for this clause the " _Adjustment
Notice_ ") containing (i) the Trued Up Balance Sheet, (ii) the PurchaserÂ’s
calculation of the Net Working Capital as reflected on the Trued Up Balance
Sheet and (iii) the PurchaserÂ’s calculation of the Trued Up Working Capital
Adjustment.

 



 

(2) Within ***** days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, the *****,
acting jointly, will deliver to the Purchaser a written response in which the
*****, acting jointly will either:

 



      
 

 



 

(x) agree in writing with the PurchaserÂ’s calculation of the Trued Up Working
Capital Adjustment, in which case such calculation will be final and binding
on the parties for purposes of Section 2.4(a)(ii) above; or

 



 

(y) dispute PurchaserÂ’s calculation of the Trued Up Working Capital Adjustment
as set forth in the Adjustment Notice by delivering to the Purchaser a written
notice (for this clause a " _Dispute Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for each such disputed item and certifying that all such
disputed items are being disputed in good faith.

 



 

For purposes of this Section 2.4(a)(ii)(2)(y), the ***** may not deliver a
Dispute Notice on the basis that the PurchaserÂ’s calculation of the Net
Working Capital and Trued Up Working Capital Adjustment be incorrect due to a
mistake attributable to a ***** or to the Acquired Company while under control
of the *****.

 



 

(3) If the *****, acting jointly, fail to take either of the foregoing actions
within 15 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, then the ***** will be
deemed to have irrevocably accepted the PurchaserÂ’s calculation of the Trued
Up Working Capital Adjustment as set forth in the Adjustment Notice, in which
case, such calculation will be final and binding on the parties for purposes
of Section 2.4(a)(ii).

 



 

(4) If the *****, acting jointly, deliver a Dispute Notice to the Purchaser
within 15 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, then the Purchaser and
*****, acting jointly, will attempt in good faith, for a period of 30 days, to
agree on the calculation of the Trued Up Working Capital Adjustment. Any
resolution by the Purchaser and the *****, acting jointly, during such 30-day
period as to any disputed items will be final and binding on the parties for
purposes of Section 2.4(a)(ii). If the Purchaser and *****, acting jointly, do
not resolve all disputed items by the end of 30 days after the date of
delivery of the Dispute Notice, then the Purchaser and the *****, acting
jointly, will submit the remaining items in dispute to KPMG AG, Zurich, for
resolution, or if that firm is unwilling or unable to serve or the parties
wish to select another Person, the Purchaser and the *****, acting jointly,
will engage another mutually agreeable independent accounting firm of
recognized international standing, which firm is not the regular auditing firm
of the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies. If the Purchaser and the *****,
acting jointly, are unable to jointly select such independent accounting firm
within 10 days after such 30-day period, any one of ***** or Purchaser may ask
a competent court to determine an independent accounting firm of recognized
international standing; provided, however, the court may not select
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or an affiliated entity without the appropriate
approvals from the Purchaser for such non-audit work. The Purchaser and the
*****, acting jointly, will instruct the independent accounting firm to render
its determination with respect to the items in dispute in a written report
that specifies the conclusions of the independent accounting firm as to each
item in dispute and the resulting calculation of the Trued Up Working Capital
Adjustment. The Purchaser and the *****, acting jointly, will each use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the independent accounting firm to
render its determination within 30 days after referral of the items to such
firm or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable. The determinations of
the independent accounting firm with respect to the Trued Up Working Capital
Adjustment as set forth in its report will (provided absence of manifest
errors) be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section
2.4(a)(ii). The Purchaser will revise the Trued Up Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Trued Up

 



      
 

 



 

Working Capital Adjustment as appropriate to reflect the resolution of the
issues in dispute pursuant to this Section 2.4(a). The fees and expenses of
the independent accounting firm will be shared by the Purchaser and the *****
in inverse proportion to the relative amounts of the disputed amount
determined to be for the account of the Purchaser and the *****, respectively.

 



 

(5) For purposes of complying with this Section 2.4, the Purchaser and the
*****, acting jointly, will furnish to each other and to the independent
accounting firm such work papers and other documents and information relating
to the disputed issues as the independent accounting firm may request and are
available to that party (or its independent public accountants) and will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the independent accounting firm any
material related to the disputed items and to discuss the items with the
independent accounting firm. The Purchaser may require that the independent
accounting firm enter into a customary form of confidentiality agreement with
respect to the work papers and other documents and information regarding the
Acquired Companies provided to the independent accounting firm pursuant to
this Section 2.4.

 



 

(iv) Any balance remaining in the Working Capital Escrow Fund shall be
released to the ***** on the later of (A) 120 days after the Closing, and (B)
the final determination and payment (if any) of the Trued Up Working Capital
Adjustment pursuant to clause (ii) above.

 



 

(b) EUR *****. This amount shall be deposited at Closing in an escrow account
(the " _Old Reserve Escrow Fund_ ") pursuant to the Escrow Agreements. Payment
of said amount shall be made as follows:

 



 

(i) Payment shall be made to ***** as set out in _Exhibit 2.4_ upon (y)
receipt of a definitive written tax ruling prior to ***** confirming that
there is no adverse withholding tax consequence applicable to Purchaser upon
payment of a dividend by the Company to Purchaser, where such adverse
consequence results from the status of ***** as predecessor owner of the
respective Shares sold hereunder (the " _Adverse Withholding Tax Consequence_
") (a " _Favorable Ruling_ ") or (z) Purchaser determining, in its sole and
unlimited discretion, that it would not suffer an Adverse Withholding Tax
Consequence notwithstanding the failure to receive a Favorable Ruling;

 



 

(ii) If a Favorable Ruling has not been received, payment of the full amount
of the Old Reserve Escrow Fund shall be made to Purchaser on the earlier of
(y) the date the Parties hereto mutually agree in writing in good faith that
further attempts to obtain a Favorable Ruling should no longer be pursued or
(z) *****; or

 



 

(iii) To determine whether a Favorable Ruling has been received or not, the
following shall apply:

 



 

A Favorable Ruling shall be considered obtained upon acceptance (by stamp of
the relevant office) by the Swiss tax authorities of:

 



 

(x) the letter attached hereto as _Exhibit 2.5(b)(iii)_ ;

 



 

(y) any other letter submitted to such tax authorities on behalf of the
Company by the Sellers with the consent of the Purchaser (such consent to not
be unreasonably witheld and wherein the Purchaser agrees to *****; or

 



 

(z) any other form of ruling to be mutually agreed between the Purchaser and
the Sellers on a reasonable basis.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) EUR ***** to be deducted from the part of the Closing Consideration of the
Founders only and as set out in _Exhibit 2.4_. This amount shall be deposited
at Closing in an escrow account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ ") pursuant to
the Escrow Agreements and shall (unless to be paid to the Founders pursuant to
this Agreement) serve to cover payments to Purchaser resulting from any Losses
from any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty or from any
breach of any covenant by a Founder hereunder. Payment of amounts out of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be made as follows:

 



 

(i) To the Founders in proportion of the deductions made for funding the
Indemnity Escrow Fund: the remaining balance no later than ***** to the extent
no claims of Purchaser hereunder are pending on *****, i.e. raised in good
faith (whereby giving a Claim Notice shall be sufficient that a claim is
regarded to be raised hereunder) and not finally resolved, against any
Founder; or

 



 

(ii) To the Purchaser: in accordance with Section 9.3; or

 



 

(iii) as agreed by the Founders and Purchaser in writing.

 



 

(d) EUR *****. This amount shall be transferred at Closing to an account
("Sellers-IV Account") designated by the Sellers-IV, acting jointly, and shall
be used to make payments as agreed amongst the Sellers-IV.

(c) The Owned Real Property is land (without hazardous material deposited on
or in it and only with structures than can be torn down without having to

for the purpose it has been acquired for by the respective Acquired Company

Knowledge concerning any Intellectual Property licensed from third parties. To
the FoundersÂ’ Knowledge, neither the conduct of the business of the Acquired
Companies nor the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ creation, use, license or other transfer

their respective Restricted Persons to, disclose to any Person any information
with respect to the legal, financial or other terms or conditions of this

 _Section 5.8_ _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(A) The Founders acknowledge that the Acquired Companies have over many years
devoted substantial time, effort and resources to developing the Acquired
CompaniesÂ’ trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information,
as well as the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ relationships with customers, suppliers,
employees and others doing business with the Acquired Companies; that such
relationships, trade secrets and other information are vital to the successful
conduct of the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ businesses in the future; that because of
the FoundersÂ’ access to the CompanyÂ’s confidential information and trade
secrets, the Founders would be in a unique position to divert business from
the Acquired Companies and to commit irreparable damage to the Acquired
Companies were the Founders to

 



      
 

 



 

be allowed to compete with the Acquired Companies or to commit any of the
other acts prohibited below; that the enforcement of the restrictive covenants
against the Founders would not impose any undue burden upon any Founder; and
that the ability to enforce the restrictive covenants against the Founders is
(among others) a material inducement to the decision of the Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly,
except where permitted by a prior written consent of the Purchaser, during the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of
the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) no Founder and no Executive will, anywhere in countries where the Acquired
Companies do business, directly or indirectly, whether as a principal, agent,
employee or otherwise, or alone or in association with any Person, own, share
in the earnings of, invest in the stock, bonds or other securities of, manage,
operate, control, participate in the ownership, management, operation, or
control of, finance (whether as a lender, investor or otherwise), guaranty the
obligations of, be employed by, associated with, or otherwise aid or assist in
any manner any Person that is engaged in or competitive with the business of
any Acquired Company (a " _Competing Activity_ "). The Founders and the
Executive will not be in violation of this Section 5.8(a) solely by reason of
investing in stock, bonds or other securities of any Person engaged in a
Competing Activity (but without otherwise participating in such business), if
(A) (i) such stock, bonds or other securities are listed on any national
securities exchange and (ii) such investment does not exceed, in the case of
any class of the capital stock of any one issuer, 5% of the issued and
outstanding shares of such capital stock, or, in the case of bonds or other
securities, 5% of the aggregate principal amount thereof issued and
outstanding;

 



 

(b) no Founder and no Executive will directly or indirectly (i) solicit the
business of any Person who is a customer of any Acquired Company, (ii) cause,
induce or attempt to cause or induce any customer, supplier, independent
contractor, licensee, licensor, or franchisee or other business relation of
any Acquired Company to cease or reduce the extent of its business
relationship with such Acquired Company or to deal with any competitor of such
Acquired Company or (iii) in any way interfere with the relationship between
any Acquired Company and any of its customers, suppliers, licensees,
licensors, franchisees or other business relations;

 



 

(c) no Founder and no Executive will directly or indirectly, recruit, solicit,
cause, induce or attempt to cause or induce any employee of any Acquired
Company to leave his or her employment either for the Founder, the Executive
or for any other Person, or in any way interfere with the relationship between
any Acquired Company and any of its employees;

 



 

(d) no Founder and no Executive will disparage the Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents;

 



 

(B) The Financial Investors acknowledge that the Acquired Companies have over
many years devoted substantial time, effort and resources to developing the
Acquired CompaniesÂ’ trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary
information, as well as the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ relationships with customers,
suppliers, employees and others doing business with the Acquired Companies;
that such relationships, trade secrets and other information are vital to the
successful conduct of the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ businesses in the future; that
because of the Financial InvestorsÂ’ access to the CompanyÂ’s confidential
information and trade secrets, the Financial Investors would be in a unique
position to divert business from the Acquired Companies and to commit
irreparable damage to the Acquired Companies were the Financial Investors to
commit any of the acts prohibited below; that the enforcement of the
restrictive covenants against the Financial Investors would not impose any
undue burden upon any Financial Investor; and that the ability to enforce the
restrictive covenants against the Financial Investors is (among others) a
material inducement to the decision of the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, except where
permitted by a prior written consent of the

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) no Financial Investor will disparage the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents;

 



 

(b) no Financial Investor will directly or indirectly, recruit, solicit,
cause, induce or attempt to cause or induce any employee of any Acquired
Company to leave his or her employment either for the Financial Investor or
for any other Person, or in any way interfere with the relationship between
any Acquired Company and any of its employees, except where an employee
responds to a general advertisement or executive search conducted in the
ordinary course of business and not directed specifically at one or more of
the employees of the Acquired Companies; and

 



 

(c) each Financial Investor will not, and will cause those of its Affiliates,
which operate as investment funds, to not cause any Person to start-up a
company whose business is that of a direct competitor of any of the Acquired
Companies in any of the territories where the Acquired Companies are doing
business as of the Closing Date. Direct competitor to the Acquired Companies
shall be understood as a company providing third party representation services
to pharmaceutical companies. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause shall not
require any of the Financial Investors (i) to prevent any of their current or
future portfolio companies from engaging in such activity (other than any
future portfolio company in which a Financial Investor has helped, financially
or otherwise, start or establish such company) or (ii) to refrain from making
one or more investments into a current or future portfolio company that is
already competing with the Acquired Companies.

 



 

 _Section 5.9_ _Public Announcements_. Upon execution of this Agreement, the
parties will issue the press releases substantially as set forth in _Exhibit
5.9_ or as agreed among the parties hereto. Any public announcement or similar
publicity with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by

determine. The Purchaser and the Sellers will consult with each other
concerning the means by which the employees, customers, suppliers and others
having dealings with the Acquired Companies will be informed of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Purchaser has the right
to be present for any such communication. Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall
prevent any party that is a listed company or forms part of a listed group of
companies from complying with the applicable securities and stock exchange
rules on transparency.

 



 

 _Section 5.10_ _Discharge of Board_. Purchaser shall, at the first general
meeting of the shareholders of the Company held after the Closing Date, have
put on the agenda and vote for the discharge of the current board members of
the Company for the business conducted through the Closing Date. The parties
hereto understand and agree that such discharge is not a waiver of any rights
Purchaser may have hereunder. This Section 5.10 shall apply to Subsidiaries of
the Company, but only to the extent that Executives are concerned and only if,
by granting discharge to such Executives, Purchaser or any of the Acquired
Companies do not forgo any right against any other board member of such
Subsidiary they may have without such discharge.

 



 

 _Section 5.11_ _No Lawsuits and Claims_. Except for rights arising from
Ancillary Agreements, with effect as of the Closing, Sellers shall waive and
shall procure that any Person controlling a Seller waives, and herewith waive
any claims they may have against any of the Acquired Companies, their
employees and/or directors, and commit to bring no lawsuit whatsoever against
any of them for any kind of right a Seller may today or in the future have,
whether known or unknown to them, relating to any past or current relationship
connected to any of the Acquired Companies.

severally liable with the Founder he controls (for Mr. Nemec, J.E. BIGA S.A.,
and for Mr. Swanson, Robert Stuart Swanson Living Trust, Swanson Irrevocable
Trust) for all obligations that Founder may have under this Agreement or, in
connection with this Agreement, towards the Purchaser, and to become an
obligor of such obligations ( _kumulativer Schuldbeitritt_ ). The Parent
agrees to be jointly and severally liable with the Purchaser for all
obligations that Purchaser may have under this Agreement or, in connection
with this Agreement, towards any of the Sellers, and to become an obligor of
such obligations ( _kumulativer Schuldbeitritt_ ).

 



 

 _Section 5.17_ _Supporting Covenant of Financial Investors_. To the extent
the Financial Investors have the right, be it based on contract, Law or
otherwise, to prevent a breach of a covenant of the Founders set out in

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement might trigger certain Change of Control Events and that such Change
of Control Events triggered or any direct or indirect financial or other
consequence resulting thereof shall not release Purchaser from its obligation
to consummate the transaction as contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall
Sellers or the Acquired Companies assume any responsibility or be liable vis-
a-vis the Purchaser for any Change of Control Events triggered or any direct
or indirect financial or other consequence resulting thereof, provided always,

has been Fairly Disclosed to Purchaser.

 



 

 _Section 6.2_ _Conditions to the Obligation of the Sellers_. The obligation
of the Sellers to consummate the sale of the Shares and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is subject to the satisfaction, on or before

(b) delivery of all closing deliveries as per Section 2.6(b); and

 



 

(c) the representations and warranties of the Purchaser as per Section 4 being

 _Section 6.3_ _Waiver of Certain Clearance_. The parties agree that should
the closing conditions under Section 6.1(a) and Section 6.2(a) not be met

full financial year 2010 not having granted clearance (be it expressly or by
letting expire a waiting period) for the transaction contemplated herein, the
parties shall enact legally permissible and binding hold separate agreements
between the parties for the purpose of acting in accordance with the
standstill obligations as per the applicable competition laws of such
territories, which shall be in force until the respective clearance(s) is/are
granted, and take all such other legally permissible measures as commercially
reasonably practical to nevertheless allow Closing of the transaction and
agree to waive Section 6.1(a) and Section 6.2(a) to the extent they relate to
such clearance not yet obtained.

under Section 7.1 are in addition to any other rights it may have under this
Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of such rights of termination is not

legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 8 
[ _INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK_ ]**

 



 

 **ARTICLE 9

(A) Subject to the limitations expressly set forth in Section 9.6, the
Founders, jointly and severally (with the exception of the Limited
Representations where their liability shall not be joint and several but

requirement for such obligation of Founders, will indemnify and hold harmless

value of, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Purchaser directly or

 _Section 9.2_ _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations
expressly set forth in Section 9.6, the Purchaser, without a fault of the
Purchaser or any other Person being a requirement for such obligation of the
Purchaser, will indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers from and against, and
will pay to the Sellers the monetary value of, any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by the Sellers directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to or
resulting from any of the following:

 



 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or
document delivered by the Purchaser in connection with this Agreement; and

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 9.3_ _Claim Procedure_.

 



 

(a) A party that seeks indemnity under this Article 9 (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") will give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from
whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") containing (i) a
description in reasonable detail and, if known, the estimated amount of any
Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified
Party, (ii) a reasonable explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice to the
extent of the facts then known by the Indemnified Party and (iii) a demand for
payment of those Losses, it being agreed and understood that, if a Claim
Notice is not delivered to the Indemnifying Party within 30 days after the
Indemnified Party detected the fact or matter which gives rise to a claim and
that it has a claim against the Indemnifying Party and determined the
approximate extent thereof, any Loss that results from not complying with the
30 days time limit and could have been prevented had such time limit been
observed, shall not be recoverable from the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) Within 30 days after delivery of a delivered Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party will deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response in
which the Indemnifying Party will either:

 



 

(i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Losses
at issue in the Claim Notice; or

 



 

(ii) dispute the Indemnified PartyÂ’s entitlement to indemnification by
delivering to the Indemnified Party a written notice (an " _Objection Notice_
") setting forth in reasonable detail each disputed item, the basis for each
such disputed item and certifying that all such disputed items are being
disputed in good faith.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party fails to take either of the foregoing actions
within 45 days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the Indemnifying Party
will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the Claim Notice and the
Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have irrevocably agreed to pay the Losses
at issue in the Claim Notice.

 



 

(d) If the Purchaser is the Indemnified Party and if any of the Founders is
the Indemnifying Party with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant
to this Article 9, the parties will contemporaneously deliver to the escrow
agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreements copies of each Claim Notice and
Objection Notice in connection with such claim. Any indemnification of the
Purchaser by the Founders pursuant to this Article 9 will first be satisfied
by payment from the Indemnity Escrow Fund established in accordance with the
provisions of the Escrow Agreements until the funds contained in such escrow
fund are exhausted or released.

 



 

 _Section 9.4_ _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting the general application of the other provisions of this
Article 9, if a third Person that is not a party to this Agreement alleges
facts that, if true, would mean that a party has breached its representations
or warranties or covenants in this Agreement, the party for whose benefit the
representation, warranty or, respectively, covenant is made will be entitled
to indemnity for those allegations and demands and related Losses under and
pursuant to this Article 9. If the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification
pursuant to this Article 9 in connection with a claim by a third Person that
is not a party to this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will include in the
Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party notice of the commencement of any
Proceeding relating to that third party claim within 30 days after the
Indemnified Party has received written notice of the commencement of such
Proceeding. The Indemnified Party will include in this notice the facts
constituting the basis for such Proceeding and the amount of the damages
claimed by the third party claim, in each case to the extent known to the
Indemnified Party.

 



     

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delay or deficiency on the part of the
Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any Liability or obligation under this Agreement except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual Losses directly
caused by the delay or other deficiency.

 



 

(b) Within 30 days after the Indemnified PartyÂ’s delivery of notice of the
commencement of such Proceeding under this Section 9.4, the Indemnifying Party
may assume control of the defense of such Proceeding by giving to the
Indemnified Party written notice of the intention to assume such defense, but
if and only if the Indemnifying Party further:

 



 

(i) acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any Losses that may
be assessed in connection with such Proceeding constitute Losses for which the
Indemnified Party will be indemnified pursuant to this Article 9 without
contest and that the Indemnifying Party will advance all expenses and costs of
defense; and

 



 

(ii) retains counsel for the defense of such Proceeding reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and furnishes to the Indemnified Party
evidence satisfactory to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party has
and will have sufficient financial resources to fund on a current basis the
cost of such defense and paying all Losses that may arise under the claim.

 



 

However, in no event may the Indemnifying Party assume or maintain control of
the defense of any Proceeding involving criminal liability or in which any
relief other than monetary damages is sought against the Indemnified Party, or
in which it can be reasonably assumed that the outcome of any Judgment or
settlement in the matter may adversely affect the business of the Indemnified
Party. An Indemnifying Party will lose any previously acquired right to
control the defense of any Proceeding if for any reason the Indemnifying Party
ceases to actively, competently and diligently conduct the defense.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not able to, assume or maintain
control of such defense in compliance with Section 9.4(b), the Indemnified
Party has the right to control such defense. If the Indemnified Party controls
such defense, the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay to the Indemnified Party
promptly upon demand from time to time all reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and
other costs and expenses of defense. The party not controlling such defense
(the " _Noncontrolling Party_ ") may participate therein at its own expense.
However, if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the
Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or different defenses available
with respect to such Proceeding, then the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party will be considered and included as "Losses"
for purposes of this Agreement. The party controlling such defense (the "
_Controlling Party_ ") will reasonably advise the Noncontrolling Party of the
status of such Proceeding and the defense thereof and will consider in good
faith recommendations made by the Noncontrolling Party. The Noncontrolling
Party will furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have
with respect to such Proceeding (including copies of any summons, complaint or
other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim,
demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same)
and will otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the
defense of such Proceeding.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnified Party is controlling the defense of such Proceeding,
the Indemnified Party has the right to agree in good faith to any compromise
or settlement of, or the entry of any Judgment arising from, such Proceeding
without prior consent of the Indemnifying Party. All amounts paid or payable
under such settlement or Judgment are Losses that the Indemnifying Party owes
to the Indemnified Party under this Article 9\. The Indemnifying Party will
not agree to any compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any Judgment
arising from, any such Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent the Indemnified Party will not unreasonably
withhold or

 



      
 

 



 

delay. The Indemnified Party will have no Liability with respect to any
compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any Judgment arising from, any
such Proceeding effected without its consent, provided such consent was not
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article 9, if a third Person
that is not a party to this Agreement asserts that the Purchaser (or any of
its Affiliates, including the Company and the Subsidiaries) is liable to such
third Person for a monetary or other obligation which individually may
constitute or result in Losses not to exceed EUR 50,000 for which the
Purchaser may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article 9, and
the Purchaser reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason to
fulfill such obligation, then (i) the Purchaser will be entitled to satisfy
such obligation, without prior notice to or consent from the Indemnifying
Party, (ii) the Purchaser Indemnified Party may subsequently make a claim for
indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Article 9 and (iii)
the Purchaser Indemnified Party will be reimbursed, in accordance with the
provisions of this Article 9, for any such Losses for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article 9, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to dispute the Purchaser Indemnified PartyÂ’s entitlement to
indemnification, or the amount for which it is entitled to indemnification,
under the provisions of this Article 9\. This Section 9.4(e) is not applicable
to payments which aggregate more than EUR 50,000.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.13, the Sellers consent to
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding is brought
by any third party against the Purchaser for purposes of any claim that the
Purchaser may have under this Agreement with respect to the Proceeding or the
matters alleged therein. The Sellers agree that process may be served on them
with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world.

 



 

 _Section 9.5_ _Survival_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the limitations set out in Section 9.6, the right to make
claims under any representation or any warranty contained in this Agreement
and any right resulting from the breach of a ***** and/or the covenant
pursuant Section 5.2(b)(iv) and/or the covenant pursuant Section 5.17 will
survive the Closing for a time limit until *****; _provided_ that (i) the
right to make claims under any representation or warranty contained in *****
shall survive for ***** years from the Closing Date, and (ii) the right to
make claims under any ***** and the right to make claims under any other
covenant shall, with respect to the Financial Investors, survive for *****
from the Closing Date, and, with respect to the Founders, survive for *****
from the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) If an Indemnified Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party before the end
of the applicable time limits set out in Section 9.5(a) above, either a Claim
Notice or a notice that, as a result of a Proceeding instituted or claim made
by a third Person that is not a party to this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
reasonably expects to incur Losses, then the respective right to make claims
under the applicable representation, warranty or covenant will survive until,
but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such notice;
_provided_ , however, notwithstanding the foregoing, that the right to make
claims under the applicable representation, warranty or covenant shall expire
if the Indemnified Party has not initiated arbitral proceedings in accordance
with Section 10.13 on or before the expiry of seventh (7th) month from the end
of the applicable time limit set out in Section 9.5(a) above.

 



 

 _Section 9.6_ _Limitations on Liability_.

 



 

(a) Neither the Sellers nor the Purchaser are liable under this Article 9
unless and until the aggregate Losses (not including those relating to Section
3.15 (Tax Matters)) for which they or it, respectively, would otherwise be
liable under this Agreement exceed EUR ***** (at which point the Sellers or
the Purchaser, as applicable, are liable for the aggregate Losses and not just
amounts in excess

 



      
 

 



 

of that sum), _provided_ however that, regarding Losses relating to Section
*****, the Founders are not liable under this Article 9 unless and until the
aggregate Losses relating to ***** for which they would otherwise be liable
under this Agreement exceed EUR ***** (at which point the Founders are liable
for the aggregate Losses and not just amounts in excess of that sum).

 



 

(b)

 



 

(i) in no event are the Founders liable for Losses under this Agreement

warranty contained in this Agreement and Losses resulting from Section

however, that the cap set forth in this Section 9.6(b)(i) shall not apply to
any breach of or inaccuracy in the Limited Representations of Founders; and

 



 

(ii) (x) in no event is any of the Founders liable for Losses under this
Agreement resulting to or from any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation and warranty or any breach of any covenants for an aggregate
amount in excess of the Closing Consideration, (y) and in no event is Seller 4
liable for Losses under this Agreement resulting to or from any inaccuracy in
or breach of any Limited Representation or any breach of covenant (for which
Seller 4 is liable) for an aggregate amount in excess of EUR *****, provided
that in the event that *****. In the event that there are Losses resulting
from an inaccuracy in or breach of *****, and such Losses in the aggregate
exceed EUR *****, (z) and in no event is ***** liable for Losses under this
Agreement resulting to or from any inaccuracy in or breach of any ***** or any
breach of covenant ***** for an aggregate amount in excess of EUR
*****million, provided that in the event that there is no Loss resulting from
any inaccuracy in or breach of any *****, such cap of EUR ***** million shall
be reduced to EUR ***** million. In the event that there are Losses resulting
from an inaccuracy in or breach of Limited Representations *****, the cap of
EUR ***** million shall be reduced by such amount in excess of EUR *****
million..

hereof in

 



 

(i) *****

 



 

(ii) *****

 



 

(iii) *****

 



 

(iv) *****

 



 

(all such documents, matters and information referred to in this Section
9.6(c) collectively the " _Disclosure Information_ ")

 



 

shall operate as exclusion of, or a limitation to, the SellersÂ’ representation
and warranties (except the Limited Representations).

 



 

(d) The limitations provided in Section 9.6(a) do not apply to (i) claims with
respect to any amounts owing by the Sellers or the Purchaser in connection
with the adjustment of the Closing Consideration in accordance with Section
2.3 and/or Section 2.4 and claims under any representation or warranty to the
extent such claims are for Losses that would not have been incurred had the
basis for computing the Trued Up Working Capital Adjustment been accurate in
all respects, provided that the inaccuracy was not fully corrected when
determining the Trued Up Working Capital Adjustment,

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) claims under Section 9.1(A)(a) if relating to a Limited Representation,
Section 9.1(A)(b), Section 9.1(A)(d) in connection with Exhibit 9.1 matters
(i) through (v), or (iii) claims under Section 9.1(B).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement limits the Liability of a party to another party for fraud or
willful misconduct.

 



 

(f) In no event is any of the Sellers liable for Losses under this Agreement

all costs and expenses incurred in making such recovery (including reasonable
attorneyÂ’s fees) and of all related and documented increases of insurance
premiums;

 



 

(ii) a provision, reserve or valuation allowance has been or is made or
included in the Interim Balance Sheet, in an amount equal to the amount of

reserve or allowance has, as shown in the Interim Balance Sheet, been made for
a specific type of or a specific possible Loss and not just as a general
provision, reserve or valuation allowance, and (B) the Trued Up Working
Capital Adjustment would not have changed had such provision, reserve or
allowance already been used before the computation of the Trued Up Working
Capital Adjustment to cover a Loss;

Affiliates is reduced as a result of a matter giving rise to a claim, in an
amount equal to the amount of such reduction; and

 



 

(iv) such claim arises or is increased as a result of any legislation,
regulation, rule of law or practice not in force at the date hereof, whether

released.

condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the
written extension or waiver. No failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right or remedy under this Agreement or any of the documents delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, and no course of dealing between the parties,
operates as a waiver of such right or remedy, and no single or partial
exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any other or further exercise
of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Any
enumeration of a partyÂ’s rights and remedies in this Agreement is not intended
to be exclusive, and a partyÂ’s rights and remedies are intended to be
cumulative to the extent permitted by law and include any rights and remedies
authorized in law or in equity.

 



 

 _Section 10.6_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules
and Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement that are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the parties, or any of them, written
or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement will remain in effect in
accordance with its terms as modified pursuant to Section 5.7.

 



 

 _Section 10.7_ _Assignment and Successors_. This Agreement binds and
benefits the parties and their respective heirs, successors and assigns,
except that no party may assign any rights under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other parties. No party may delegate any
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except that the Purchaser
may at any time delegate the performance of its obligations to any Affiliate
of the Purchaser so long as the Purchaser remains fully responsible for the
performance of the delegated obligation. Except to the extent expressly
provided in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is intended or will
be construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns any
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 10.8_ _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in
any way and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such
invalid, illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and
enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under this
Agreement, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision.

 



 

 _Section 10.9_ _Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this
Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 10.10_ _Interpretation_. The language used in this Agreement is the
language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted for or against any party
because that party or its attorney drafted the provision.

 



 

 _Section 10.11_ _Set-off Rights_. Subject to the set-off rights of a party
explicitly provided for in this Agreement, no party shall be entitled to set-
off any claims they may have against each other.

 



 

 _Section 10.12_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement is subject to Swiss Law,
excluding the CISG.

 



 

 _Section 10.13_ _Jurisdiction_. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising
out of or in relation to this Agreement, including the validity, invalidity,
breach or termination thereof, shall be settled by arbitration

 



      
 

 



 

in accordance with the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration of the Swiss
Chambers of Commerce in force on the date when the Notice of Arbitration is
submitted in accordance with these Rules. The number of arbitrators shall be
three. The seat of the arbitration shall be in Zurich, and the arbitral
proceedings shall be conducted in English. This clause shall not apply to the
court referred to in Section 2.4(a)(ii)(4) to determine the independent
accounting firm.

 



 

 _Section 10.14_ _Counterparts_. The parties may execute this Agreement in
multiple counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the
party that signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This
Agreement is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each
party to the other parties. The signatures of all parties need not appear on
the same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or
email transmission that includes a copy of the sending partyÂ’s signature is as
effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.
