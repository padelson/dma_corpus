1.4. _Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Directors and Officers_.

  

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of HashingSpace, as in effect immediately

Effective Time until amended in accordance with applicable law and such
Certificate of Incorporation.

Effective Time until a successor shall have been elected and shall have
qualified in accordance with applicable law, or as otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Surviving Company or the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of HASH, as the case may be.

  

1.5. _Assets and Liabilities_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises of a public as
well as of a private nature, and be subject to all the restrictions,

the "Constituent Companies"); and all the rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of each of the Constituent Companies, and all property, real,
personal and mixed, and all debts due to any of the Constituent Companies on
whatever account, as well as all other things in action or belonging to each
of the Constituent Companies, shall be vested in the Surviving Company; and
all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and all and every
other interest shall be thereafter as effectively the property of the
Surviving Company as they were of the several and respective Constituent
Companies, and the title to any real estate vested by deed or otherwise in
either of such Constituent Companies shall not revert or be in any way
impaired by the Merger; but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any
property of any of the Constituent Companies shall be preserved unimpaired,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Constituent Companies shall
thenceforth attach to the Surviving Company, and may be enforced against it to
the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or
contracted by it.

  

    

1.6. _Manner and Basis of Converting Equity_. At the Effective Time:

  

(a) all of the shares of capital stock, $0.00001 par value, of Acquisition,
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the

(the "HASH Series A Preferred Stock"), as set forth on Exhibit F
(collectively, the "Merger Shares").

certificate or certificates registered in the name of such HashingSpace
Holders representing the number of shares of HASH Common Stock that such
HashingSpace Holders shall be entitled to receive as set forth in Section
1.6(b). Until the certificate(s) is or are surrendered, each certificate(s)
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any outstanding
shares of HashingSpace Shares shall be deemed at and after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon surrender as aforesaid the number
of shares of HASH Common Stock as specified in Section 1.6(b) for the holder
thereof or to perfect any rights of appraisal that such holder may have
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Stock and 600,000 shares of HASH Series A Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding, and that no other common or preferred stock or equity securities
or any options, warrants, rights or other agreements or instruments
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into common or preferred stock or
other equity securities shall be issued or outstanding.

  

1.9. _Operation of Surviving Company_. HashingSpace acknowledges that upon the
effectiveness of the Merger, and the compliance by HASH and Acquisition with
their respective duties and obligations hereunder, HASH shall have the
absolute and unqualified right to deal with the assets and business of the
Surviving Company as its own property subject only to the limitations on the
disposition or use of such assets or the conduct of such business as existed

parties and their respective legal counsel in order to effectuate or evidence

business in all material respects as it is now being conducted, including
qualification to do business in jurisdictions in which the character and
location of the assets owned by it or the nature of the business transacted by

rights or "drag-along" rights) of any securities of HashingSpace. To the
knowledge of HashingSpace, there are no agreements among other parties to
which HashingSpace is a party and by which it is bound with respect to the

ARTICLE VII 
  TERMINATION

  

7.1. _Termination_.

  

(a) This Agreement may be terminated by either the HashingSpace Board or the
HASH Board at any time prior to the Closing Date if: (i) there shall be any
actual or threatened action or proceeding before any court or any governmental
body which shall seek to restrain, prohibit, or invalidate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and which, in the judgment of such board of
directors, made in good faith and based on the advice of its legal counsel,
makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Merger contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) any of the transactions contemplated hereby are disapproved by
any regulatory authority whose approval is required to consummate such
transactions or in the judgment of such board of directors, made in good faith
and based on the advice of counsel, there is substantial likelihood that any
such approval will not be obtained or will be obtained only on a condition or
conditions which would be unduly burdensome, making it inadvisable to proceed
with the Merger; (iii) there shall have been any change after the date of the
latest balance sheets of HashingSpace and HASH, respectively, in the assets,
properties, business, or financial condition of HashingSpace and HASH, which
could have a materially adverse affect on the value of the business of
HashingSpace and HASH, respectively, except any changes disclosed in the
HashingSpace Financial Statements and HASH Reports, as the case may be, dated
as of the date of execution of this Agreement; or (iv) the Closing Date shall
not have occurred by October 31, 2015. In the event of termination pursuant to
this Section 7.1(a), no obligation, right, or liability shall arise hereunder,
and each party shall bear all of the expenses incurred by it in connection
with the negotiation, drafting, and execution of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
action of the HASH Board if HashingSpace fails to comply in any material
respect with any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or
if any of the representations or warranties of HashingSpace contained herein
shall be inaccurate in any material respect, and, in either case if such
failure is reasonably subject to cure, it remains uncured for three (3) days
after notice of such failure is provided to HashingSpace. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to this Section 7.1(b), this Agreement shall be of no
further force or effect, and no obligation, right, or liability shall arise
hereunder.

  

(c) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
action of the HashingSpace Board if HASH or Acquisition fails to comply in any
material respect with any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or if any of the representations or warranties of HASH or
Acquisition contained herein shall be inaccurate in any material respect, and,
in either case if such failure is reasonably subject to cure, it remains
uncured for three (3) days after notice of such failure is provided to HASH.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 7.1(c), this
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect, and no obligation, right, or
liability shall arise hereunder.
