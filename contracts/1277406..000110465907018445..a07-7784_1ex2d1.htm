 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 12, 2007 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is made by and among **REDFORD HOLDCO, LLC** , a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Parent_ "),  **REDFORD MERGER CO.** , a
Maryland corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), and **SPIRIT FINANCE CORPORATION**
, a Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "). All capitalized terms used in
this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in Section 9.2
or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement unless the context
clearly indicates otherwise.

  

W I T N E S S E T H :

  

WHEREAS, the parties wish to effect a combination through a merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Maryland General
Corporation Law, as amended (the " _MGCL_ "), pursuant to which each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Company (collectively, the " _Company Shares_ "), shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined herein) upon the terms
and subject to the conditions provided herein;

  

WHEREAS, Parent and the Company have entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
(the "Stock Purchase Agreement") dated the date hereof whereby Parent has
agreed to purchase 6,150,000 Company Shares on the terms and conditions set
forth therein;

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
approved this Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock Purchase
Agreement and deems it advisable and in the best interests of the Companys
stockholders to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the
terms and conditions set forth herein;

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub and Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, have declared advisable, authorized and approved
this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the requirements of the MGCL and the charter and
bylaws of Merger Sub; and

  

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger, and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:    

 **ARTICLE I**

  

 **THE MERGER**

  

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time (as defined herein), the Company and Merger Sub shall
consummate the Merger, pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease and (ii) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and shall become a direct wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent by virtue of ownership of all of the Company
Shares. The corporate existence of the Company, with all its purposes,
rights, privileges, franchises, powers and objects, shall continue unaffected
and unimpaired by the Merger and, as the Surviving Company, it shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Maryland. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in Section 3-114 of the MGCL.

  

1.2 _Charter and Bylaws_.

  

(a) The name of the Surviving Company shall be "Spirit Finance Corporation."

  

(b) The Company Charter as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
will be amended as part of the Merger so as to contain the provisions, and
only the provisions, contained immediately prior to the Effective Time in the
charter of Merger Sub, except for Article II thereof, which shall read "The
name of the corporation is Spirit Finance Corporation," and, as so amended,
shall be the charter of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended or
further supplemented in accordance with its terms and Maryland law (the "
_Surviving Company Charter_ "). References herein to the Merger shall
include the amendments to the Company Charter to be effected as part of the
Merger.

  

(c) The Bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be amended by the Company Board as of the Effective Time so as to
contain the provisions, and only the provisions, contained immediately prior
to the Effective Time in the Bylaws of Merger Sub and, as so amended, shall
be the Bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance
with their terms and Maryland law (the " _Surviving Company Bylaws_ ").

 **ARTICLE II**

  

 **MERGER CONSIDERATION; EFFECT OF THE MERGER 
 ON THE SHARES OF THE CONSTITUENT COMPANIES**

  

2.1 _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Shares or any
shares of stock of Merger Sub:

  

(a) _Stock of Merger Sub_.  Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company. Each
share of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "
_Merger Sub Preferred Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable
share of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company
(the " _Surviving Company Preferred Stock_ "). The Surviving Company Charter
shall contain the terms and rights of the Surviving Company Preferred Stock,
which shall be the same as those of the Merger Sub Preferred Stock.

  

(b) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each Company Share (other than
Excluded Shares, as defined below) issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the

       

Effective Time shall automatically be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $14.50, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

  

(c) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each issued
and outstanding Company Share that is owned by the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or any Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash,
Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor.

  

(d) _Cancellation of Shares_.  As of the Effective Time, all Company Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Company
Share shall cease to have any rights with respect to such interest, except,
in all cases, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest.

  

(e) _Restricted Shares and Stock Options_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
that, except as set forth on Section 2.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
all options to purchase Company Shares (" _Company Stock Options_ ")
and restricted share awards (the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") granted
under any director or employee stock option and incentive plan, equity
compensation plan or similar arrangement of the Company (collectively, the "
_Company Stock Option Plan_ ") shall vest in full immediately prior to the
Effective Time so as to no longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting
requirements (whether or not then vested or subject to any performance
condition that has not been satisfied). As of the Effective Time, each then
outstanding unexercised Company Stock Option shall be cancelled by the
Company and in consideration of such cancellation, the Company shall pay
to each holder thereof (and, if requested by the Company at least five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall provide cash to the
Company for such payment) at the Effective Time in cash, net of withholding,
an amount per Company Share subject to such cancelled Company Stock Option
equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration, over (ii) the
per share exercise price for such Company Stock Option (the "Option
Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company
Restricted Share that vests under this Section 2.1(e) shall be cancelled by
the Company and in consideration of such cancellation, the Company shall pay
to each holder thereof (and, if requested by the Company at least five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall provide cash to the
Company for such payment) at the Effective Time in cash, net of withholding,
an amount per Company Restricted Share equal to the Merger Consideration.

  

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act
as Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the cash payment in accordance
with this Article II of the Merger Consideration (such cash being referred to
as the " _Payment Fund_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to deposit with the Paying Agent the

       

Payment Fund for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares.  The Paying
Agent shall make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Payment Fund
in accordance with this Agreement and the Articles of Merger. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on
cash deposited in the Payment Fund shall be paid to Parent.

  

(b) _Share Transfer Books_.  On the Closing Date, the share transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Company Shares. From and after the Closing
Date, (i) the holders of certificates representing ownership of the Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and (ii) holders of Company Stock Options or Company
Restricted Shares (each, a " _Grant_ "), which shares and options shall vest
in full immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1(e),
shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares or options, except as
otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Closing Date, any
Certificates presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company or the
transfer agent for any reason shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration
with respect to the Company Shares formerly represented thereby.

  

(c) _Payment Procedures_.  As soon as possible after the Closing Date (but in
any event within three Business Days thereof), the Surviving Company shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s)
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding
Company Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive or be
exchanged for Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1: (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent, the Paying Agent and
the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Company Shares previously represented by such
Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Closing Date to represent only the right to
receive, upon such surrender, the Merger

       

Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2.  No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Shares_. On the Closing Date,
holders of Company Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration provided under this Article II and, if applicable, any
distributions on Company Shares declared in accordance with Section 5.1 but
not paid as of the Closing Date. The Merger Consideration or
the consideration set forth in Section 2.1(e) with respect to Company Stock
Options paid or delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Grants representing Company Shares in accordance with the terms of
this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights and privileges pertaining to the Company Shares or Company Stock
Options exchanged therefor.

  

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_.  Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve months
after the Closing Date, shall be delivered to the Surviving Company and any
holders of Company Shares prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Company and only as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger
Consideration.

  

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company,
the Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or
Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger
Consideration from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Company Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to the end of the
applicable escheat period (or such earlier date as shall be immediately prior
to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), any such unclaimed
funds payable with respect to such Company Shares shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  

(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_.  The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments,
or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost
through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is,
at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

  

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting of
a bond to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent, the
Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for

       

such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

  

2.3 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Company, Parent or the Paying Agent,
as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Shares or Company Stock Options, such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
(as defined herein), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent, as applicable,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Shares or Company Stock Options, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Company, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

  

2.4 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
hereby.

  

2.5 _Adjustment of Merger Consideration_. In the event that, subsequent to
the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Shares issued and outstanding shall, through a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock split or other similar change in the capitalization of the Company
increase or decrease in number or be changed into or exchanged for
a different kind or number of securities, then an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration,
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing set forth in this Section 2.5 shall
be construed to supersede or in any way limit the prohibitions set forth in
Section 5.1 hereof.

  

2.6 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise the
Surviving Companys right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets of the Company as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise to carry out the
intent of this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Company
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, all
such other actions and things as may be necessary to vest, perfect or confirm
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights,
properties, privileges, franchises or assets in the Surviving Company or
otherwise to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

  

 **ARTICLE III**

  

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this Article III are true and correct except as set
forth in the disclosure schedule attached to this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ "). The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in
this Article III and the disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify and apply
to other

       

paragraphs in this Article III to the extent reasonably apparent that such
disclosure would relate to such other paragraphs.

  

3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries and Other Interests_.

  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland. The Company Charter,
as amended through the date hereof, is in effect and no dissolution,
revocation or forfeiture proceedings regarding the Company have been
commenced. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign entity and is in good standing under the laws of any other
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned, leased
or operated by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not reasonably be
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now
conducted. The term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means a material
adverse effect on (x) the assets, liabilities, condition (financial or
otherwise), business or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) the ability of the Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, or to perform its obligations under, this
Agreement prior to the Outside Date, or (z) the ability of (i) the Company to
qualify as a REIT prior to the Effective Time or (ii) the Company to qualify
as a REIT after the Effective Time, assuming solely for this purpose that the
Merger was not consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
following, in and of itself or themselves, shall be considered in determining
whether a Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred under clause
(x) of this definition:

  

(i) changes arising out of or resulting from the announcement of this
Agreement;

  

(ii) changes in the economy or financial markets, including, without
limitation, prevailing interest rates and market conditions, generally in the
United States or globally or that are the result of acts of war or terrorism,
except to the extent any of the same disproportionately affects the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as compared to other companies in the industry in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate;

  

(iii) changes that are proximately caused by factors generally affecting the
industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, except to the
extent any of the same disproportionately affects the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries;

  

(iv) changes in, or in the application of, GAAP;

  

(v) changes in applicable Laws, except to the extent any of the same
disproportionately affects the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as compared
to

       

other companies in the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate;

  

(vi) any failure by the Company to meet any estimates of revenues or earnings
for any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing; provided that the exception in this clause shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect, circumstance or
development underlying such failure or that such reduced revenues or earnings
constitutes, has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse
Effect; and

  

(vii) a decline in the per share stock price of the Company Shares on the New
York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE"); _provided_ that the exception in this
clause shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change,
effect, circumstance or development underlying such decline constitutes, has
resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the industry in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate shall be the industry of acquiring and investing in
triple net lease real estate located in the United States.

  

(b) Each Company Subsidiary (as defined below) of the Company is listed
in Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and each such entity
is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or business trust
duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has the
requisite corporate power or other power and authority to own its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such
power and authority would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification or licensure, except for jurisdictions
in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not
reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.  For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company
Subsidiary_ " means any Subsidiary of the Company, and " _Material
Subsidiary_ " means a Company Subsidiary owning Company Properties with an
aggregate investment or book value in excess of $20,000,000 on an individual
basis. The aggregate investment or book value of the Company Properties owned
by all of the Company Subsidiaries that are not Material Subsidiaries does
not exceed $100,000,000. Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of each Company Subsidiary which
is a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(i) of the
Code, or a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(l) of
the Code.

  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

interests of each of the Company Subsidiaries have been validly issued and
are (A) fully paid and

       

nonassessable, (B) owned by the Company or by a Company Subsidiary, and (C)
owned, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien (as hereinafter
defined). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Lien_ " means, with respect to
any asset (including any security), any mortgage, claim, lien, pledge,
charge, security interest or encumbrance of any kind in respect of such
asset.

  

(d) Except for the interests in the Company Subsidiaries set forth in Section
3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and except as set forth in Section
3.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary owns directly or indirectly any interest or investment
(whether equity or debt) in any Person (other than investments in short-
term investment securities or cash equivalents).

  

(e) The Company has previously made available to Parent true and complete
copies of the Company Charter and the Companys bylaws (the "Company Bylaws")
and the comparable organizational documents of each Material Subsidiary, each
as amended through the date hereof. Such documents are in full force and
effect.

  

3.2 _Capitalization_.

  

(a) The Company Charter authorizes the issuance of up to 375,000,000 Company
Shares and 125,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share
(the "Preferred Shares"). As of the date of this Agreement, (i) 107,935,085
Company Shares were issued and outstanding, (ii) 4,100,000 Company Shares
have been authorized and reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock

described above. All such issued and outstanding shares of stock of the
Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive or similar rights arising under any provisions of the
MGCL, the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or any agreement to which the
Company is a party or is otherwise bound.

  

(b) The Company has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of the Company on any matter.

  

(c) Except for the Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares, there
are no existing options, warrants, calls, subscription rights, convertible
securities or other rights, agreements or commitments (contingent or
otherwise) which obligate the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue,
transfer or sell any stock (or similar ownership interest) of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, securities which are convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for any such shares (or similar ownership interests), or
equity equivalents, stock appreciation rights or phantom stock ownership
interests in the Company or any Company Subsidiary or similar rights.
 Except for the

       

Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares, the Company has not
issued any share appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance
awards, restricted stock unit awards or "phantom" shares. True and complete

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and those set forth in the Company Charter or in the organizational documents
of the Company Subsidiaries, there are no agreements or understandings to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party with respect to the
voting of any stock (or other ownership interests) of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or which restrict the transfer of any such stock (or
ownership interests) except in the case of the Company Subsidiaries with
respect to transfer restrictions related to securities law compliance set
forth on the face of any certificates representing stock or other ownership
interests of the Company Subsidiaries, nor does the Company have knowledge of
any third party agreements or understandings with respect to the voting of
any such shares (or other ownership interests) or which restrict the transfer
of any such shares (or other ownership interests).

  

(e) Except for Company Restricted Shares that fail to vest and except as set
forth in Section 3.2(c) and Section 3.2(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem, exchange, convert or otherwise
acquire any stock or any other securities of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

  

(f) Except as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is under any obligation, contingent or otherwise,
by reason of any agreement to register the offer and sale or resale of any of
its securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ ").

  

3.3 _Authority Relative to this Agreement; Stockholder Approval_.

  

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. No other proceedings on the part of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby

to the financial statements in the Company SEC Reports, since January 1,
2006. The Company and its officers and directors are in compliance with the

reporting and preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and
the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and (y)
effective disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule

the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data
and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys Internal Controls. To
the knowledge of the Company, its Disclosure Controls are and have been
effective in timely alerting the Companys management to such material
information required to be included in the Companys periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act. Neither the Company nor the Company
Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any Representative of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has received any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or

correct and complete list of each employee benefit plan, within the meaning
of ERISA Section 3(3) whether or not subject to ERISA, and each other benefit
program, policy, agreement, understanding, arrangement, policy, practice or
plan (whether written or oral) providing compensation or benefits to any
current or former director, employee or consultant (or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof), including employment agreements, bonuses, incentive
compensation, change in control benefits, vacation, severance, insurance,

since the Companys formation was, maintained, sponsored or contributed to
(or with respect to which any obligation to contribute has been undertaken)
by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. Each Employee Program that is intended
to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the "
_IRS_ ") regarding its qualification thereunder and, to the Companys
knowledge, no event has occurred and no condition exists that is reasonably
expected to result in the revocation of any such determination.

401(a); (iii) the three (3) most recently filed IRS Form 5500, if applicable;

accordance with its terms and the requirements of applicable law, including,
without limitation, ERISA and the Code (including, without limitation,
Section 409A of the Code), except as would not reasonably be likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. With
respect to each Employee Program, all tax, annual reporting and other
governmental filings required by ERISA and the Code have

       

been timely filed with the appropriate governmental entity and all notices

which the Company could be subject to any liability (other than for routine
benefit liabilities) under the terms of, or with respect to, such Employee
Programs, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law, except as would not
reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No Employee Program is subject to Title IV

Employee Programs to have paid as contributions to such Employee Programs on

contribution requirements, on a prorated basis, for the current year have
been made or otherwise properly accrued on the books and records of the
Company through the Closing Date.

commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any
Employee Program (other than for benefits payable in the ordinary course of
business).

Schedule, no Employee Program provides for medical, life insurance or other
welfare plan benefits (other than under Section 4980B of the Code or state
health continuation laws) to any current or future retiree or former employee
and all such plans have effectively reserved the right to amend or terminate
such plans without participant consent.

  

(g) All Company Stock Options have an exercise price per share that was not
less than the "fair market value" of a Company Share on the date of grant, as
determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable Employee Program
and, to the extent applicable, Sections 409A and 422 of the Code.  All
Company Stock Options have been properly accounted for by the Company in
accordance with GAAP, and no change is expected in respect of any prior
Company financial statement relating to expenses for stock compensation. To
the Companys knowledge, there is no pending or threatened audit,
investigation or inquiry by any governmental agency or by the Company with
respect to the Companys stock option granting practices or other equity
compensation practices.

  

(h) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company has withheld and
paid all amounts required by applicable Law or by agreement to be withheld
from the wages, salaries, and other payments to employees, independent
contractors and other service

penalty for failure to withhold or pay such amounts. The Company
has properly classified all individuals providing services to the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries as employees or non-employees for all
relevant purposes.

  

(i) (A) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(i)(A) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or as contemplated in Section 2.1(e) hereof, neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will result in any payment, acceleration or creation of
any rights of any person to benefits under any Employee Program; (B) except
as set forth in Section 3.10(i)(B) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
amount that could be received (whether in cash, property, the vesting of
property or otherwise) as a result of or in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in
combination with any other event), by any employee, officer, director or
other service provider of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries who
is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) could reasonably be expected to be characterized
as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code); and (C) except as set forth in Section 3.10(i)(C) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a
party to any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any persons
that, individually or collectively, would reasonably be expected to give rise
to the payment of any amount that would constitute compensation in excess of
the limitations set forth in Section 162(m) of the Code.

  

(j) Section 3.10(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of (i) all Company Restricted Shares that are
subject to vesting conditions on the date hereof and will be vested and no
longer subject to repurchase by the Company at the Effective Time, and (ii)
all Company Stock Options, including the exercise price thereof, that are
unexercised and outstanding on the date hereof and will be vested and
exercisable at the Effective Time, assuming in the case of clauses (i) and
(ii) above, that no other event or circumstance occurs that would cause such
Company Restricted Shares or Company Stock Options to be forfeited by the
holder, exercised by the holder or repurchased by the Company.

  

3.11 _Labor Matters_.

  

(a) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or bound
by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or
understanding with a labor union or labor union organization, nor are there
any negotiations or discussions currently pending or occurring between the
Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and any union or employee
association regarding any collective bargaining agreement or any other work
rules or polices. There is no unfair labor practice or labor arbitration
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to its business. To the
Companys knowledge, there are no organizational efforts with respect to the
formation of a collective bargaining unit presently being made or threatened
involving employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

       

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary in any
forum by or on behalf of any present or former employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, any applicant for employment or classes of the foregoing
alleging breach of any express or implied employment contract, violation of
any law or regulation governing employment or the termination thereof, or any
other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct on the part of the Company

fully and timely paid taking into account any extensions or similar
administrative relief which may have been obtained by the Company or are
being contested in good faith and have been adequately reserved in accordance

as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and any
corresponding provision of relevant state Law and has satisfied all

action that could reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the IRS
or any other taxing authority to the Companys status as a REIT and (iv) to

Code and any corresponding provision of relevant state Law or a "taxable REIT
subsidiary" pursuant to Section 856(l) of the Code and any corresponding
provision of relevant state Law. Except as set forth on Section 3.13(b) of

insurance policy with substantially similar terms and conditions to the
canceled, terminated or expired policy except where a replacement policy or

not available after using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
coverage (in which case, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable

(q) other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, modify, amend or terminate any Company Lease or Ground Lease or

 **ARTICLE VI 
  
 COVENANTS**

  

6.1 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the Company
shall prepare a proxy statement in preliminary form (the " _Proxy Statement_
"). Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than 45 days)
following the date hereof, the Company shall file the Proxy Statement with
the SEC and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as reasonably promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto; provided, however, that the Company shall not be in breach
of this provision if the failure to file the Proxy Statement in such 45-day
period is a result of Parent or Merger Subs failure to reasonably promptly
provide information required to be included in the Proxy Statement regarding
Parent and Merger Sub or to reasonably promptly respond to drafts of the
Proxy Statement submitted to Parent or Merger Sub for review. Parent and
Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in connection with
the preparation of the Proxy Statement, including, but not limited to,
furnishing to the Company any and all information regarding Parent and Merger
Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be required or reasonably
advisable to be disclosed therein as promptly as possible after the date
hereof. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence
between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or
the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response and will include in such documents
or responses all comments reasonably proposed by Parent, and to the extent
practicable, the Company will provide Parent with the opportunity to
participate in any substantive calls between the Company, or any of its
Representatives, and the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement.

  

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any event occurs with respect to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any
change occurs with respect to other information to be included in the Proxy
Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, shall promptly notify the other party of such

        

event and the Company shall promptly file with the SEC, with Parents input
and cooperation, any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement.

  

(c) Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Solicitation Period End Date, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of the holders of the Company Shares (the " _Company Stockholders 
Meeting_") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval.
The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to such holders
as promptly as reasonably practicable after all SEC comments on the
Proxy Statement have been resolved. The Company shall, through the Company
Board, recommend to holders of the Company Shares that they give the Company
Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), except to the extent
that the Company Board shall have withdrawn or modified its adoption of this
Agreement and its recommendation in the Proxy Statement, as permitted by and
determined in accordance with Section 6.4(b). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after notice to
Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to
the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of Company Shares sufficiently
in advance of a vote on this Agreement and the Merger to ensure that such
vote occurs on the basis of full and complete information as required
under applicable Law. The Company shall keep Parent updated regarding proxy
solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent.

  

6.2 _Other Filings_. As soon as reasonably practicable, the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub each shall properly prepare and file any other filings (other
than the Proxy Statement) required under the Exchange Act or any other
federal, state or foreign law relating to the Merger (including filings, if
any, required under the HSR Act) (collectively, the " _Other Filings_ "). To
the extent Parent deems such a filing necessary or appropriate, the Company
and Parent shall file as promptly as practicable a joint voluntary notice in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 721 of the
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and the rules and regulations
thereunder (the " _Exon-Florio Amendment_ "). Each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the other of the receipt of any comments
on, or any request for amendments or supplements to, any of the Other Filings
by the SEC or any other Governmental Entity or official, and each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall supply the other with copies of
all correspondence between it and each of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the members of its staff or any other appropriate
governmental official, on the other hand, with respect to any of the Other
Filings. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each shall promptly obtain and
furnish the other (a) the information which may be reasonably required in
order to make such Other Filings and (b) any additional information which may
be requested by a Governmental Entity and which the parties reasonably deem
appropriate.

  

6.3 _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, but subject to the obligation to act in good faith, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly
as practicable the Merger. The parties shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the foregoing, including the taking of such actions as are
necessary to obtain any necessary consents,

   

45  

  

approvals, orders, exemptions and authorizations by or from any public or
private Third Party, including, without limitation, any that are required to
be obtained under any federal, state or local law or regulation or any
contract, agreement or instrument to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective properties
or assets are bound, to defend all lawsuits or other legal proceedings
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, and to effect
all necessary registrations and Other Filings and submissions of information
requested by a Governmental Entity. The parties will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be lifted or rescinded any injunction or
restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the
parties to consummate the Merger. In the event that the Company shall fail to
obtain any Third Party consent described above, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take such actions as
are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective businesses
resulting, or which would reasonably be expected to result, after the
Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any
approval or consent from any Person (other than a Governmental Entity) with
respect to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (i) unless
expressly required by the applicable agreement, without the prior written
consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being
solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation due to such Person and (ii) unless expressly
required by the applicable agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates
shall not be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval
or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
commitment or incur any liability or other obligation. For the avoidance of
doubt, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall make any payments or commit
to make payments under provisions in applicable agreements setting forth
minimum payments in connection with consent to or waiver of defaults or
breaches under such agreements, or under prepayment or defeasance provisions,
without the prior written consent of Parent, and none of Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their Affiliates shall be required to make or commit to make any
such payments. The Company shall use its commercially reasonably efforts to
assist Parent in providing any notices required under the CMBS Agreements as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof.

  

6.4 _Permitted Solicitation_.

  

(a) During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on the date that is 28 days after the date
hereof (the " _Solicitation Period End Date_ "), the Company, its
Subsidiaries, and their respective Representatives shall be permitted to, and
shall have the right to, directly or indirectly (acting under the direction
of the Company Board) (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiry with
respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Alternative
Proposal and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, and
furnish to any person information with respect to, and take any other action
to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes,
or may lead to, an Alternative Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries
or any Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries to, provide to any
third party any material non-public information unless the Company receives
from

       

such third party an executed confidentiality agreement with confidentiality
and standstill provisions in form no more favorable to such person than those
confidentiality and standstill provisions contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and simultaneously provides to Parent any non-public information
provided to such third party not previously made available to Parent.

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.4, and except as it may
relate to any person or group of related persons from whom the Company has
received, prior to the Solicitation Period End Date, an Alternative Proposal
that the Company Board as of the Solicitation Period End Date and
continuously thereafter reasonably believes in good faith, after consultation
with the Company Boards legal counsel and financial advisors, is bona fide
and would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (each such
person or group, an " _Excluded Party_ "), (A) on the Solicitation Period End
Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause
its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any
discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect
to any Alternative Proposal and request to be returned or destroyed any non-
public information provided to such parties and (B) during the period
beginning on the Solicitation Period End Date and continuing until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VIII, the Company agrees that neither it nor any
Subsidiary of the Company shall, and that it shall cause its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiry with respect to or
which would reasonably be expected to result in, or the making, submission or
announcement of, any Alternative Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussion
or negotiations regarding or which would reasonably be expected to result in
an Alternative Proposal with any person, or furnish any non-public
information or access to its properties, books, records or personnel to, any
person; (iii) engage in discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal with
any person, except to notify such person as to the existence of the
provisions of this Section 6.4; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any
Alternative Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in
principle or any agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal (except for
confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 6.4(c)); (vi) otherwise
cooperate with, or assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate or
encourage any effort or attempt by any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub
or their Representatives) with respect to, or which would reasonably be
expected to result in, an Alternative Proposal; or (vii) exempt any person
from the restrictions contained in any state takeover or similar laws or in
any confidentiality or standstill agreements or the restrictions on transfer
and ownership of shares of capital stock of the Company contained in the
Company Charter or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply. The
Company shall promptly inform its Representatives, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries promptly to inform their respective Representatives, of the
obligations under this Section 6.4(b).

  

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.4(b), at any time
from the Solicitation Period End Date and continuing until the earlier of the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and the Termination Date, if (A)
the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.4 which the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation

       

with the Company Boards legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (B) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company
Boards legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure of the Company
Board to take the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with respect
to such Alternative Proposal would be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their duties to the Company or the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law, then the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish
non-public information to the third party making such Alternative Proposal
(if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company
receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement with
confidentiality and standstill provisions in form no more favorable to such
person than those confidentiality and standstill provisions contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement) and simultaneously provides to Parent any non-
public information not previously made available to Parent and (y) engage in
discussions or negotiations with such third party with respect to such
Alternative Proposal.

  

(d) Other than in accordance with Section 6.4, the Company Board shall not
(i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board of the
Merger or this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to approve,
adopt or recommend, any Alternative Proposal; (iii) make any recommendation
in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a
recommendation against such offer; or (iv) exempt any person from the
restrictions contained in any state takeover or similar laws or in any
confidentiality or standstill agreements or the restrictions on transfer and
ownership of shares of capital stock of the Company contained in the Company
Charter (each of the foregoing, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_
,  _however_ , that, in response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal that
has not been withdrawn or abandoned, the Company Board may, at any time prior
to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, make a Change of
Recommendation if all of the following conditions in clauses (i) through (iv)
are met:

  

(i) the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with
the Company Boards legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure of
the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the directors exercise of their duties to the Company or the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law;

  

(ii) the Company shall have provided Parent with written notice of its
intention to effect a Change of Recommendation (a " _Change of Recommendation
Notice_ ") at least three Business Days prior to effecting a Change of
Recommendation, which shall state expressly (A) that it has received a
Superior Proposal, (B) the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal and the identity of the Person or group making the Superior
Proposal, and (C) that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and
the manner in which it intends to do so;

       

(iii) after delivering the Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company shall
have provided Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement during such three Business Day
period (a " _Matching Period_ "), and shall have negotiated in good faith
with respect thereto during such Matching Period, regarding any changes
proposed by Parent for the purpose of enabling the Company Board to proceed
with the Company Recommendation, without effecting a Change of
Recommendation; and

  

(iv) the Company shall not have breached in any respect any of the provisions
set forth in this Section 6.4 with respect to such Superior Proposal.

  

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply
with the requirements of this Section 6.4(d) with respect to such new written
notice (including beginning a new Matching Period).

  

(e) No Change of Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company
Board for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute or other state law to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The
Company Board shall not make any Change of Recommendation other than in
compliance with and as permitted by this Section 6.4. Notwithstanding any
Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to,
and in accordance with, Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided any
such disclosure (other than (i) a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act or (ii) a rejection by the Company of the relevant tender offer) shall be
subject to compliance by the Company with Section 6.4 and shall be deemed to
be a Change of Recommendation.

  

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide proposal or offer made by any person or group of persons (other than a
proposal or offer by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) for (i) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving
the Company; (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition in a single transaction
or series of related transactions by any person of 10% or more of the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) the direct or
indirect acquisition in a single transaction or series of related
transactions by any person of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock; or (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of the
Shares then outstanding.

       

(h) As used in this Agreement " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an
Alternative Proposal (with all percentages, in the definition of Alternative
Proposal increased to 50%) on terms that the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys or the Company Boards financial
advisors and legal counsel, and considering all relevant factors as the
Company Board considers to be appropriate (including, but not limited to, the
timing, ability to finance, financial and regulatory aspects and likelihood
of consummation of such proposal, and any alterations to this Agreement
agreed to in writing by Parent in response thereto), is more favorable from a
financial point of view (taking into account the foregoing factors) to the
Companys stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(i) Within 48 hours of or the second Business Day immediately following the
Solicitation Period End Date, whichever is later, the Company shall notify
Parent, in writing, of the identity of each Excluded Party and provide Parent
a copy of each Alternative Proposal received from any Excluded Party (or,
where no such copy is available, a description of such Alternative Proposal).
 From and after the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall promptly
(within 48 hours of or the second Business Day immediately following, if
later) notify Parent in the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries
or Representatives receives (i) any Alternative Proposal or
written indication by any Person that it is considering making an Alternative
Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries by a Person contemplating making an Alternative
Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations
regarding any Alternative Proposal (in each case, including the identity of
the Person making the Alternative Proposal or indication, request or inquiry
and the material terms and conditions thereof). Following the Solicitation
Period End Date, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed (orally or
in writing) on a current basis (and in any event no later than 48 hours after
or, if later, the second Business Day after, the occurrence of any
significant discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Alternative
Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including the material terms and
conditions thereof and of any material modification thereto), including
furnishing copies of any material written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly
(within 48 hours of or, if later, the second Business Day after) notify
Parent in writing if it determines to provide non-public information to a
Person contemplating making, or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning, an Alternative Proposal pursuant to Section 6.4(c) other than
with an Excluded Party, in each case after the Solicitation Period End Date.
 The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing such information
to Parent.

  

6.5 _Officers  and Directors Exculpation and Indemnification_.

  

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation in which any Person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Closing Date,
a director, officer, employee, trustee, fiduciary or agent of the

       

Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_
" and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to
be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was an officer,
director, trustee, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as
an officer, director, trustee, employee, fiduciary or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (ii)
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, any agreement
or document contemplated hereby or delivered in connection herewith, or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, in any case under (i) and
(ii) above arising on or before the Closing Date and whether asserted at,
before or after the Closing Date, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use their commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. It is understood and agreed that the Company shall maintain its
current Charter provisions regarding directors and officers exculpation and
shall indemnify and hold harmless, and after the Closing Date, the Surviving
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each Indemnified Party against any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation
(arising on or before the Closing Date and whether asserted at, before or
after the Closing Date), (A) the Company and, after the Closing Date, the
Surviving Company shall promptly pay expenses, as incurred, in advance of the
final disposition of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
demand, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law and without requiring a preliminary
determination as to the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, (B) the
Company, and after the Closing Date, the Surviving Company, shall be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of a single counsel (selected by a
plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties
with respect to any single action or related actions except to the extent
that two or more such Indemnified Parties have conflicting interests in the
outcome of such action, within 30 days after statements therefor are
received, and (C) the Company and, after the Closing Date, the Surviving
Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the
vigorous defense of any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Company nor the Surviving Company shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); and  _provided_ , _further_  that the
Company and the Surviving Company shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final
and non-appealable, that indemnification by such entities of such Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law; and
_provided_ , _further_ that an Indemnified Party shall only be entitled
to the advancement of funds for expenses if it first provides (i) a
written affirmation by the director of the directors good faith belief that
the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Company or
Surviving Company, as applicable, as authorized by Section 2-418 of the MGCL
and (ii) a written undertaking to the Company or the Surviving Company (in
form and substance

       

reasonably acceptable to Parent), to reimburse such advances in the event it
is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party was not entitled to such indemnification. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.5,
upon learning of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the
Closing Date, the Surviving Company thereof; provided that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company and the Surviving
Company except to the extent, if any, such failure to promptly notify
materially prejudices such party.

  

(b) Parent and Merger Sub each agree that all rights to indemnification
existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each
Indemnified Party provided for in the respective charters or bylaws (or other
applicable organizational documents) of the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from
the Closing Date and, at the Closing Date, shall become the obligation of the
Surviving Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claims (each, a " _Claim_ ") asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Claim. From and after the Closing Date, the Surviving Company also agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing
Date to the extent provided in any written indemnification agreements between
the Company and/or one of the Companys Subsidiaries and the officers and
directors listed in Section 6.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase a non-cancelable
extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys directors and
officers in the same form (other than immaterial deviations) as presently
maintained by the Company (a complete and accurate copy of which has been
made available to Parent), with the same or comparably rated insurers as the
Companys current insurer, which shall provide such directors and officers
with coverage with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time for six years following
the Closing Date of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other
terms not less favorable to, the insured persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the coverage described above cannot
be obtained or can only be obtained by paying aggregate premiums in excess of
the amount set forth in Section 6.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule for
such coverage, the Surviving Company shall only be required to provide as
much coverage as can be obtained by paying aggregate premiums equal to the
amount set forth in Section 6.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule for
such coverage. The Surviving Company shall provide notice to the Persons
covered by such policy prior to reducing the amount of coverage. The Company
agrees to consult with Parent in connection with purchasing such coverage.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain such
policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor all obligations
thereunder.

       

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this Section 6.5 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.5
applies without the consent of each such affected indemnitee.  This Section
6.5 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party
beneficiary rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
shall be binding on all successors of the Surviving Company. Each of the
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs shall be entitled to enforce
the provisions of this Section 6.5.

entity of such consolidation or merger, (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person or (iii)

6.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and each of the Companys and
Company Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees and agents to, afford to
Parent and to the Representatives of Parent reasonable access upon reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours without undue interruption
(and will request the same from the Companys Representatives) to the
employees properties, books, records and contracts of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall obtain
the Companys consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

any such visits or access. Parent shall obtain the Companys consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, prior to
contacting or meeting with any of the Companys employees. The Company shall

applicable tenant; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor its

sediment) or any building material or to perform any invasive testing
procedure on any building or property.

  

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence
all such information on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in
that certain confidentiality agreement between Macquarie Securities (USA)
Inc. and the Company dated November 6, 2006 (the " _Confidentiality

6.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may,
without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or
make such public statement as may be required by Law or the applicable rules
of any stock exchange or quotation system if the party issuing such press
release or making such public statement has used its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent
but has been unable to do so in a timely manner. In this regard, the parties
shall make a joint public announcement of the Merger contemplated hereby no

the date on which this Agreement is fully executed.

  

6.8 _Employee Benefit Arrangements_.

  

(a) Immediately after the Closing Date, the Company or a Company Subsidiary
shall continue to employ each individual employed by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries who was employed by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose name is set
forth on Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (such employees,
collectively, the " _Business Employees_ "). Immediately after the Closing
Date, all Business Employees shall continue to be eligible to participate in
all "employee benefit plans", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (an "
_Employee Benefit Plan_ "), of the Company which are continued by Parent,
or alternatively shall be eligible to participate in the same manner as
other similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries in similar
Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or in which employees
of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate after the Closing Date. With
respect to each such Employee Benefit Plan of Parent, service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the predecessor of any of them shall
be included for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and
vesting (if applicable) under such Employee Benefit Plan. Parent shall, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to use its commercially
reasonable efforts consistent with applicable Law to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to all Business
Employees under any comparable welfare plan that such Business Employees may
be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, other than limitations
or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees
and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any comparable
welfare plan maintained by the Company for such employees immediately prior
to the Closing Date, and (ii) provide each such Business Employee with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date for the
plan year within which the Closing Date occurs in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such
employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing Date.

  

(b) Immediately after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to provide the Business Employees with employee benefits no less
favorable in the aggregate than those in effect prior to the Closing Date and
to honor fully in accordance with their terms all employment agreements,
severance agreements, retention

       

bonus agreements and other bonus, retention and severance obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which are listed in Section 6.8(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, and except as may otherwise be agreed to by the
Company and Parent, and the Company shall pay on the Closing Date to the
applicable directors, officers and employees any amounts with respect to such
agreements and obligations that are payable by their terms at or before the
Closing Date.

  

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.8 shall create any third party beneficiary
right in any person other than the parties to this Agreement, including any
current or former Business Employee, any participant in any Employee Program,
or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or any right to continued employment
with (or right to continued participation in, or continued level of benefits
with respect to, any Employee Program or any employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement of) Parent, any Affiliate of Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates following the
Closing Date. Nothing in this Section 6.8 shall constitute an amendment to
any Employee Program or any other plan or arrangement covering Business
Employees. The Company and Parent shall each cooperate with the other and
shall provide to the other such documentation, information and assistance as
is reasonably necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 6.8.

  

(d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Parent to (i) minimize the effects of any payment of any amount that could be
received (whether in cash, property, the vesting of property or otherwise) as
a result of or in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other
event), by any employee, officer, director or other service provider of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries who is a "disqualified individual"
(as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) and that
could be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code); provided, that the recipient of the
foregoing amounts shall not be required to reduce in any way the benefits or
other amounts payable to such person and (ii) at the Effective Time, amend,
reform or supplement the terms of any nonqualified deferred compensation plan
(within the meaning of Code Section 409A and related guidance) covering any
Business Employee to the extent the Company and the Parent reasonably agree
such amendment, reform or supplement (A) is necessary or appropriate to
comply with Code Section 409A or to exempt payments thereunder from Code
Section 409A and thereby avoid the application of penalty taxes under Code
Section 409A, and (B) preserves, to the extent practicable, the intended
treatment of the original plan with respect to the Company and the applicable
participants.

  

6.9 _Certain Tax Matters_. During the Interim Period, each of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall: (a) continue to operate in such a manner as
to permit the Company to continue to qualify as a REIT throughout the Interim
Period; (b) prepare and timely file all material Tax Returns required to be
filed by them on or before the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing Returns_ ") in a
manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required
by applicable Laws; and (c) fully and timely pay all material Taxes due
and payable in respect of such Post-Signing Returns that are so filed.

       

6.10 _Interim Period Dividends_. At or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall declare a quarterly prorated cash dividend covering the period
from the first date of the quarter in which the Closing occurs up to and
including the Effective Date at a rate not to exceed the rate per Company
Share set forth in Section 5.1.

  

6.11 _Resignation of Company s Directors_. If so requested by Parent, the
Company shall deliver to Parent, at or prior to the Closing Date, the
resignation, in form and substance reasonable satisfactory to Parent, of each
director of the Company.

  

6.12 _Additional Acquisitions_. In accordance with Section 5.1 of
this Agreement, during the Interim Period, the Company shall, consistent with
past practices and in the ordinary course of business, continue to
source, underwrite and evaluate additional properties for acquisition (the "
_Additional Property_ "). Should the Company identify a potential Additional
Property as a potential acquisition, the Company may, but is not required to,
seek Parents agreement in writing to provide debt or equity financing to
consummate the acquisition of the Additional Property, such agreement to be
granted in Parents sole discretion (it being understood that Parent shall
respond within five Business Days of receipt of the Companys written request
soliciting such agreement to provide debt or equity financing from Parent,
and failure to respond by Parent after five Business Days shall be deemed to
be agreement to provide debt or equity financing by Parent).

  

6.13 _Financing_.

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cooperate with Parent in
connection with the arrangement and marketing by Parent of any financing of
the Merger as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including, at Parents
sole cost and expense, making management of the Company reasonably available
for discussions with potential investors or lenders, furnishing financial
information to Parent as may be reasonably requested by Parent, assisting
Parent and its financing sources in the preparation of offering documents and
investor materials, facilitating the pledging of collateral after the
Effective Time, and using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
accountants comfort letters and consents; provided, that the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall not be obligated under any such agreement or
instrument in any way prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall not supply
any material non-public information about the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any Person without obtaining the Companys prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, and without obtaining a confidentiality and standstill agreement
among such Person, Parent and the Company in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company; provided that such non-public information of the
Company may be provided to U.S. rating agencies that have a duty to keep such
information confidential.

  

(b) In the event any portion of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) Parent shall promptly notify
the Company, and (ii) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a firm commitment for alternative financing from alternative sources
on terms not materially less beneficial to Parent and

       

Merger Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent), in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as possible, but in no event later than the time at which all
conditions to the Merger in Article VII have been satisfied.

  

6.14 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company shall, upon the request of Parent or Merger Sub, take all reasonable
steps to exclude the applicability of, or to assist, at Parents cost and
expense, in any challenge to the validity or applicability to the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, of such Takeover
Statute.

  

6.15 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the
Company, of (i) the occurrence or non occurrence of any event which is likely
(a) to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect if made as of
the Effective Time so that the Closing condition in Section 7.2(a) or 7.3(a),
as applicable, would not be satisfied or (b) to result in any
material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied hereunder, (ii) any
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (iv) any suit, claim, action or proceeding threatened or commenced
against or otherwise affecting such party or its Subsidiaries that are
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.15
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any
of the parties receiving such notice.

administrative agents under the credit agreements set forth on Section 7.2(d)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall have provided the Company with a

(i) such credit agreements shall be terminated, (ii) any and all Liens under
such credit agreements related thereto shall be released and (iii) the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall be released from any and all

requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, with customary
exceptions, assumptions and qualifications and based on customary
representations.

  

(f) _Consents_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall have received (and shall have delivered to Parent) all consents,
approvals, certificates and other items required in connection with the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby set forth on Section
7.2(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in such form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall be in full force and effect;
provided, however, that this Section 7.2(f) shall not be a condition to
Parent and Merger Subs obligation to effect the Merger if Parent has not
consented in writing to pay, or allow the Company to pay, the payments
expressly required to obtain such consents as contemplated in Section 6.3
hereof.

  

7.3 _Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Company_.  The obligations

effect qualification contained in any representation or warranty) at and as
of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent
a representation or warranty is made as of a time other than the Closing
Date, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct
at and as of such time), except where the failure of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct does not have or would not reasonably be

Effect. The Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
Parent and Merger Sub, dated the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect.

the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect.

  

7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. No party may rely on the failure of

efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereunder.

  

 **ARTICLE VIII**

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at any time

or before the Outside Date;

  

(c) by written notice from Parent to the Company, if the Company breaches or
fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations,

Outside Date;

  

(d) by written notice from the Company to Parent if Parent or Merger Sub

Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect, without
any liability on the part of

        

Parent, Merger Sub or the Company and each of their respective directors,
trustees, officers, employees, partners, or stockholders and all rights and
obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except for the agreements
contained in Sections 6.6, 6.7, 8.2 , 8.3 and Article IX; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 shall
relieve any party from liabilities or damages arising out of any fraud or
willful breach by such party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement.

  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section

then the Company shall pay to Parent, an amount in cash equal to $31,000,000

of this Agreement by the Company under Section 8.1(e), concurrently with the
effective date of such termination (i.e., following the Matching Period), or
(ii) in the case of termination of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub
under Section 8.1(c) or 8.1(f), as promptly as practical but in any event
within three Business Days after the date of termination.

  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section

event within three Business Days after the date of termination.

  

(d) If (I)(A) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(i), and, at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof at which the vote under Section 8.1(b)(i) is taken, an Alternative
Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or otherwise communicated to the
Company, or (B) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(iii) and, at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to such termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii),
an Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or otherwise
communicated to the Company, and (II) within twelve (12) months after such
termination, the Company enters into an agreement in respect of an
Alternative Proposal (which may be the same or a different Alternative
Proposal as that referred to in the immediately preceding clause (I)) or

the references to "10%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

        

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(f),
in circumstances where the Break-Up Fee is payable in accordance with Section
8.2(b), the payment of the Break-Up Fee shall constitute liquidated damages
with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which Parent or
Merger Sub would otherwise be entitled to assert against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, or against any of
their respective trustees, officers, employees, partners, managers, members
or stockholders, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Parent and Merger Sub. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge
and agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual
damages with respect to the foregoing upon any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(f), in circumstances where the
Break-Up Fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b) or (d), the rights
to payment under Section 8.2(b) or (d): (i) constitute a reasonable estimate

assets, or against any of their respective trustees, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members or stockholders, or (ii) be entitled to seek or
obtain any other damages of any kind, including, without limitation,

(a) Except as set forth in Sections 8.2, 8.3(b) and 8.3(c), whether or not

any and all acts contemplated hereunder; _provided_  that such fees and
expenses to be paid by Parent hereunder shall not exceed $2,250,000.

        

(c) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or by Parent because

without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of unaffiliated
Representatives incurred by Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates in
connection with the entering into of this Agreement and the carrying out of
any and all acts contemplated hereunder, _provided_ that the amount of such
fees and expenses to be paid by the Company hereunder shall not exceed
$2,250,000.

  

(d) If either party fails to pay to the other party any amounts due under
Section 8.2 or 8.3, the party so failing shall pay the reasonable costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses)
in connection with any action, including, without limitation, the filing of
any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment. The payment of
expenses set forth herein is not an exclusive remedy of the Company, but is
in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Company (whether
at law or in equity).

  

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any
time before or after any approval hereof by holders of the Company Shares;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after any such approval, no amendment shall be
made which by Law requires further approval by such stockholders without
obtaining such approval.

  

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other parties with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein.  Any agreement on the part of
a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of the party against which
such waiver or extension is to be enforced. Except as so waived, no
action taken or omitted to be taken pursuant to this Agreement, including,
without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance
with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

9.4 _Interpretation_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.  Wherever used herein, a pronoun in the
masculine gender shall be considered as including the feminine gender unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise and the word "including" shall mean
"including without limitation." References to any statute, rule or
regulation are to the statute, rule or regulation as amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of
statutes, include any rules and regulations promulgated under the statute)
and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation include any successor
to the section. The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and
drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

  

9.5 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_.
Except for Articles I and II, Sections 6.5, 6.8 and 6.9 and any covenant or
agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after
the Closing Date (a) none of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and (b) thereafter
there shall be no liability on the part of any of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or any of their respective officers, trustees, directors or
stockholders in respect thereof. Except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement, there are no representations or warranties of any party
hereto, express or implied.

  

9.6 _Performance Guaranty_. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt
and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of
the obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of Merger Sub
under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof.

        

9.7 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the Parent
when due, and the Parent shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax
returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and,
if required by applicable Law, the Parent shall, and shall cause its
affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax returns and other
documentation. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to minimize the amount
of any such Taxes.

  

9.8 _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage to Parent
and Merger Sub would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached by the Company. It is accordingly agreed that, prior
to termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, Parent and
Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the federal and state courts located in Maryland, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent or Merger Sub are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties acknowledge that the Company shall
not be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or any remedy to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the Companys sole and
exclusive remedies with respect to any such breach shall be the remedies set
forth in the following sentence and the Guaranties; provided, however, that
the Company shall be entitled to enforce specifically Sections **** 6.6, 6.7,
the last sentence of 6.13(a) and 6.15. The Company agrees that, to the extent
it or its Subsidiaries have incurred losses or damages of any kind in
connection with this Agreement, (i) the maximum aggregate liability of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors for such losses or damages of any kind
shall be limited to $312,000,000, (ii) the maximum liability of the
Guarantors, directly or indirectly, shall be limited to the respective
several obligations of such Guarantors under the Guaranties and (iii) in no
event shall the Company or its Subsidiaries seek to recover any money damages
in excess of such amount in clause (i) from the Parent, Merger Sub or the
Guarantors (subject to clause (ii)) or any of their respective
Representatives in connection therewith.

  

9.9 _Miscellaneous_. This Agreement (a) constitutes, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Stock
Purchase Agreement, the entire agreement and supersedes all of the
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof including,
but not limited to, the Memorandum of Understanding between the Company and
Macquarie Securities (USA) Inc. dated January 3, 2007, and (b) shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns and is not intended to confer upon any
other Person (except as set forth below) any rights or remedies hereunder.

  

9.10 _Assignment; Benefit_. Except as expressly permitted by the
terms hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Parent or Merger
Sub may assign, in their sole discretion, any or all of their rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement (i) to Parent or to any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent, (ii) to a lender
or financial institution as collateral for indebtedness or (iii) after the
Effective Time, in connection with a merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of Parent, the Surviving Company or their
Subsidiaries, but

        

no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its
obligations under this Agreement if such assignee does not perform such
obligations.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary (except for the provisions of Section 6.5 hereof which shall inure
to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are
expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may
enforce the covenants contained therein), nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the
parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors, executors,
administrators and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

9.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and to such end, the
provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. The parties further
agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable provision.

  

9.12 _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  

(a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland without regard to its rules
of conflict of laws. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland (" _Maryland Courts_ ")
for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating
thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue
of any such litigation in the Maryland Courts and agrees not to plead
or claim in any Maryland Court that such litigation brought therein has
been brought in any inconvenient forum.

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not
otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Maryland, to appoint
and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland as such partys agent for
acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be made
on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt
validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid
service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal
force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of
Maryland.

  

9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party. Facsimile transmission of any signed
original document shall be deemed the same as delivery of an original. At the
request of any party, the parties will confirm facsimile transmission by
signing a duplicate original document.

        

9.14 _Non-Recourse_. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are
expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein.  No past, present or future incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder or Representative of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability or
obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements,
obligations or liabilities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under this
Agreement or of or for any action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation,
investigation, or proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the breach, termination or
failure to consummate such transactions), in each case whether based on
contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether by
piercing the corporate veil, by a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or
another Person or otherwise.

 **EXHIBIT A**

  

 **FORM OF LIMITED GUARANTY**

  

 ** _LIMITED GUARANTY_**

  

Limited Guaranty, dated as of March 12, 2007 (this " _Limited Guaranty_
"), by  (the " _Guarantor_ ") in favor of Spirit
Finance Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the " _Guaranteed Party_ ").
 Reference is hereby made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger among Redford
Holdco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Parent_ "), Redford
Merger Co., a Maryland corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the Guaranteed
Party, dated as of March 12, 2007 (as the same may be amended from time to
time, the " _Merger Agreement_ ").  Capitalized terms used herein but not
otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  

1. _Limited Guaranty_. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Guaranteed Party, as and to the extent provided in Section 2 below, the payment and performance of % of Parents and Merger Subs payment obligations (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ") to the Guaranteed Party arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement; _provided_ that the maximum aggregate liability of the Guarantor hereunder shall not exceed $  (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), it being understood that this Guarantee may not be enforced without giving effect to the Maximum Amount. The Guaranteed Party hereby agrees that the Guarantor shall in no event be required to pay to any Person more than the Maximum Amount under, or in respect of, or in connection with this Limited Guaranty and the Guarantor shall not have any obligation or liability to any Person under this Limited Guaranty other than as expressly set forth herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Limited Guaranty or any other document, the obligations of Guarantor under this Agreement and of any other parties under any other limited guaranties in favor of the Guaranteed Party in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (collectively, the " _Other Limited Guaranties_ ") shall be several and not joint. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, this Limited Guaranty is only a guaranty to provide the Guaranteed Party monetary damages in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and shall not provide injunctive relief or specific performance of any obligations under the Merger Agreement by the Guarantor or any of its Affiliates as a remedy to the Guaranteed Party in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations.

  

2. _Terms of Limited Guaranty_.

  

(a) This Limited Guaranty is one of payment and performance, not collection.
The Guarantor reserves the right to assert defenses, if any, which Parent or
Merger Sub may have under the Merger Agreement.

  

(b) The liability of the Guarantor under this Limited Guaranty shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable.

  

(c) The Guarantor hereby waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal,
extension or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or
proof of reliance by

        

the Guaranteed Party upon this Limited Guaranty or acceptance of this Limited
Guaranty. The Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be
deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this
Limited Guaranty, and all dealings between Parent, Merger Sub or the
Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Guaranteed Party, on the other, shall
likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance
upon this Limited Guaranty.  When pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder
against the Guarantor, the Guaranteed Party shall be under no obligation to
pursue such rights and remedies it may have against Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person for the Guaranteed Obligations or any right of offset with
respect thereto, and any failure by the Guaranteed Party to pursue such other
rights or remedies or to collect any payments from Parent, Merger Sub or any
such other Person or to realize upon or to exercise any such right of offset,
and any release by the Guaranteed Party of Parent or any such other Person or
any right of offset, shall not relieve the Guarantor of any liability
hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether
express, implied or available as a matter of Law, of the Guaranteed Party.

  

(d) The Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand,
protest, promptness, diligence, obligation to protect, secure or perfect any
security interest and any notice except for notices in accordance with
Section 8.1 of the Merger Agreement.

  

(e) The Guaranteed Party shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to
any Guaranteed Obligation in the event that Parent or Merger Sub
becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and
the failure of the Guaranteed Party to so file shall not affect the
Guarantors obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the
Guaranteed Party in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, the Guarantor shall remain
liable hereunder with respect to the Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment
had not been made, and the Guarantee shall be reinstated and shall continue
even if otherwise terminated.

  

3. _Sole Remedies_. The Guaranteed Party acknowledges and agrees that the sole cash asset of Parent and Merger Sub is cash in a _de minimis_ amount and that no additional funds are expected to be contributed to Parent or Merger Sub unless the Closing occurs. The Guaranteed Party further agrees that it has no right of recovery in respect of any liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby against the Guarantor, any former, current or future, direct or indirect, Representative of the Guarantor, any former, current or future, direct or indirect, holder of any equity interests or securities of the Guarantor (whether such holder is a limited or general partner, member, stockholder or otherwise), any former, current or future assignee of the Guarantor or any former, current or future Representative or assignee of any of the foregoing (each such Person, a " _Related Person_ "), through Parent, Merger Sub or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited liability company or limited partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub against the Guarantor or any Related Person, or otherwise, except for its rights against the Guarantor under this Limited Guaranty;   _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not limit the liability of any other guarantor to the Guaranteed Party pursuant to the Other Limited Guaranties in respect of liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. Recourse against the Guarantor under this Limited Guaranty 

        

shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Guaranteed Party and all of its
Affiliates against the Guarantor and any Related Person in respect of any
liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. The Guaranteed Party
hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause
its Affiliates and stockholders not to institute, any proceeding or bring any
other claim arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or
the transactions contemplated thereby, against the Guarantor or any Related
Person, except for claims of the Guaranteed Party against the Guarantor under
this Limited Guaranty. Nothing set forth in this Limited Guaranty shall
affect any liability of Parent or Merger Sub or any other guarantor under the
Other Limited Guaranties to the Guaranteed Party or shall confer or give to
any Person other than the Guaranteed Party any rights or remedies against
any Person, including the Guarantor, except as expressly set forth herein.

  

4. _Termination_. This Limited Guaranty shall terminate and the Guarantor shall have no further obligation under this Limited Guaranty as of the earliest to occur of (i) the Effective Time; (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms by mutual consent of the parties; (iii) ninety (90) days following the termination of the Merger Agreement under any circumstance other than pursuant to clause (ii) of this paragraph unless the Guaranteed Party provides written notice to the Guarantor within such 90-day period of its intent to seek recovery under this Guaranty; and (iv) the one-year anniversary of the date hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on the date of termination of this Limited Guaranty any proceeding to enforce this Limited Guaranty has been commenced or written notice of intent to seek recovery has been sent by the Guaranteed Party to the Guarantor, Guarantors obligations hereunder shall survive such termination until such proceeding is finally and conclusively resolved.

  

5. _Continuing Guarantee_. Until terminated pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 hereof, this Limited Guaranty shall be a continuing one and shall remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, shall be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Guaranteed Party and its successors, transferees and assigns. All obligations to which this Limited Guaranty applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon.

  

6. _Entire Agreement_. This Limited Guaranty constitutes the entire agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, among Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantor or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Guaranteed Party or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, except for the Merger Agreement, the Other Limited Guaranties, the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

7. _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Limited Guaranty will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Guarantor and the Guaranteed Party or, in the case of waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No waiver by any party of any breach or violation of, or default under, this Limited Guaranty, whether intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent breach, violation or default hereunder or affect in any way any rights

        

arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No delay or
omission on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or remedy
under this Limited Guaranty will operate as a waiver thereof.

  

8. _Counterparts_. This Limited Guaranty may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute but one and the same instrument. This Limited Guaranty will become effective when duly executed by each party hereto.

  

9. _Notices_. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made as of the date delivered or sent if delivered personally or sent by facsimile (providing confirmation of transmission), on the next Business Day if sent by prepaid overnight carrier (providing proof of delivery), on the fifth Business Day following the date of mailing if delivered by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) or on the date delivered if sent by email (providing confirmation of receipt) to the parties at the following addresses or facsimile numbers (or at such other addresses or facsimile numbers as shall be specified by the parties by like notice):

10. _Governing Law_. This Limited Guaranty, the rights of the parties and all actions arising in whole or part under or in connection herewith will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

  

11. _Jurisdiction; Venue; Waiver of Service of Process_.

  

(a) _Jurisdiction_. Each party to this Limited Guaranty, by its execution
hereof, (i) hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
state courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court
located in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York for the purpose
of any action between the parties arising in whole or in part under or in
connection with this Limited Guaranty, (ii) hereby waives to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as
a defense or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such action brought
in one of the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds of _forum non
conveniens_ _,_ should be transferred or removed to any court other than one
of the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of
some other proceeding in any other court other than one of the above-named
courts, or that this Limited Guaranty or the subject matter hereof may not be
enforced in or by such court and (iii) hereby agrees not to commence any such
action other than before one of the above-named courts. Notwithstanding the
previous sentence, a party may commence any action in a court other than the
above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment
issued by one of the above-named courts.

  

(b) _Venue_. Each party agrees that for any action between the parties
arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Limited
Guaranty, such party will bring actions only in the State of New York.

  

(c) _Service of Process_. Each party hereby (i) consents to service
of process in any action between the parties arising in whole or in part
under or in connection with this Limited Guaranty in any manner permitted by
New York law, (ii) agrees that service of process made in accordance with
clause (i) or made by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,
at its address specified pursuant to Section 9, will constitute good and
valid service of process in any such action and (iii) waives and agrees not
to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any such action
any claim that service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii)
does not constitute good and valid service of process.

  

12. _Representations and Warranties_. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Guaranteed Party that (a) it has all  power and authority to execute, deliver

        

and perform this Limited Guaranty; (b) the execution, delivery and
performance of this Limited Guaranty by the Guarantor has been duly and
validly authorized and approved by all necessary
 action, and no other proceedings or actions on the part of the undersigned
are necessary therefor; (c) this Limited Guaranty has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by it and constitutes a valid and legally
binding obligation of it, enforceable against the undersigned in accordance
with its terms, subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally, and (ii) general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); (d) the execution,
delivery and performance by the undersigned of this Limited Guaranty do not
and will not (i) violate the organizational documents of the undersigned
or (ii) violate any applicable Law; and (e) the Guarantor has the
financial capacity to pay and perform its obligations under this Limited
Guaranty, and all funds necessary for the Guarantor to fulfill its Guaranteed
Obligations under this Limited Guaranty shall be available to the Guarantor
for so long as this Limited Guaranty shall remain in effect in accordance
with Section 5 hereof.

  

13. _No Assignment_. Neither the Guarantor nor the Guaranteed Party may assign its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other Person (except by operation of Law) without the prior written consent of the Guaranteed Party (in the case of an assignment by the Guarantor) or the Guarantor (in the case of an assignment by the Guaranteed Party), except that if all or a portion of the Guarantors equity commitment is assigned in accordance with the terms thereof, then a corresponding portion of its Guaranteed Obligations hereunder may be assigned to the same assignee; _provided_  that any such assignment shall not relieve the Guarantor of its obligations hereunder. [Notwithstanding the foregoing, Macquarie Bank Limited may assign all or a portion of its Guaranteed Obligations hereunder to an Affiliate (and Macquarie Bank Limited shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to such assigned portion of its Guaranteed Obligations) without the Guaranteed Partys consent if the Affiliate assignee assumes this Guaranty and Macquarie Bank Limiteds obligations hereunder in writing and such assignment is made in connection with an internal restructuring of the Macquarie Groups operations and at the time of such assignment such Affiliate has been assigned at least an investment grade credit rating from either Standard and Poors Rating Group or Moodys Investors Services, Inc.](1)

  

14. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. **TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LIMITED GUARANTY OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS LIMITED GUARANTY OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS** (1) For Macquaries Limited Guaranty only.

        

 **CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN
A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.**

  

15. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Limited Guaranty that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that this Limited Guaranty may not be enforced without giving effect to the limitation of the amount payable hereunder to the Maximum Amount provided in Section 1 hereof and to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 hereof. No party hereto shall assert, and each party shall cause its respective Affiliates not to assert, that this Limited Guaranty or any part hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable. The Guaranteed Party agrees that it will not assert any claim against Guarantor with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations in excess of the Maximum Amount.

  

16. _Headings_. The headings contained in this Limited Guaranty are for convenience purposes only and will not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation hereof.

  

17. _Subrogation_. Upon receipt by the Guaranteed Party of the Guaranteed Obligations in full (up to $312,000,000 as set forth in the Merger Agreement) in cash owing to the Guaranteed Party by the Guarantor, the guarantors under the Other Limited Guaranties and by Parent and Merger Sub, the Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Guaranteed Party against Parent and Merger Sub for claims related to the Guaranteed Obligations, and the Guaranteed Party agrees to take, at the Guarantors expense, such steps as the Guarantor may reasonably request to implement such subrogation.

  

 ** _[Remainder of page intentionally left blank]_**

Guaranty as of the date first written above.
