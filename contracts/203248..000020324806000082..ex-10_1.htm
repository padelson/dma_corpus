reasonably requested), to the extent reasonably  related to the preparation
of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation  of  the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount (and the elements of such calculation).  The  Closing
Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount 
relating to TPC shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
preparation  of  the Pro Forma Adjusted Balance Sheet (subject to, in the
case of the Closing  Balance Sheet, the exceptions from GAAP relating to the
adjustments reflected  on  the Pro Forma Adjusted Balance Sheet).

 

 

(b) _Disputes_.  If ETP  disagrees with the calculation of the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount, it shall  notify CCE of such disagreement in writing
within thirty (30) days after its  receipt of the last item to be received by
ETP pursuant to the first sentence  of  Section 2.4(a), which notice shall
set forth in detail the particulars of such  disagreement. In the event that
ETP does not provide such a notice of  disagreement within such thirty (30)
day period, ETP shall be deemed to have  accepted the Closing Balance Sheet
and the calculation of the Post-Closing  Adjustment Amount (and each element
of such calculation) delivered by CCE,  which  shall be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event  any such notice of
disagreement is timely provided by ETP, then ETP and CCE  shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30)  days  (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements  with
respect to the calculation of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount (or any 
element thereof). If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve 
such  disagreements, then, upon the written request of either party, an
independent  accounting firm (not providing services to ETP or CCE)
acceptable to ETP and  CCE  (the " **Auditor** ")  shall  resolve any
remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly  as 
practicable (but in any event within sixty (60) days) following the date on 
which such dispute is referred to the Auditor, based solely on written 
submissions, which shall be forwarded by ETP and CCE to the Auditor within 
thirty (30) days following the Auditor's selection, whether the Closing
Balance  Sheet was prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in
this Section  2.4 with respect to any items identified as disputed in the
notice of  disagreement and not previously resolved by ETP and CCE, and if
not, whether  and  to what extent (if any) the Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount (or any element  thereof) requires adjustment. Each party shall bear
its own expenses and the  fees and expenses of its own representatives and
experts in connection with  the  preparation, review, dispute (if any) and
final determination of the Closing  Balance Sheet and the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount. The parties shall share  the costs, expenses and fees of
the Auditor in inverse proportion to the extent  to which their respective
positions are sustained (e.g., if CCE's position is  one hundred percent
(100%) sustained, it shall bear none of such costs,  expenses, and fees of
the Auditor). The determination of the Auditor shall  be  final, conclusive
and binding on the parties. The Auditor's determination of the  amount of the
Post-Closing Adjustment Amount shall then be deemed to be the  Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount for purposes of this Section 2.4. The date on  which such
items are accepted or finally determined in accordance with this  Section 2.4
is referred as to the " **Determination  Date**." As  used in this
Agreement, the term "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not  include
efforts which require the performing party (i) to do any act that is 
unreasonable under the circumstances, (ii) to make any capital contribution 
not  expressly contemplated hereunder, (iii) to amend or waive any rights
under  this  Agreement, or (iv) to incur or expend any funds other than
reasonable  out-of-pocket expenses incurred in satisfying its obligations
hereunder,  including the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of
accountants,  counsel and other professionals.

 

 

(c) _ETP  and CCE Adjustments_.  If the  Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is
positive, then ETP shall pay to CCE an amount  equal to the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount (the " **ETP  Adjustment** "),  and  if the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount is negative, then CCE shall pay to ETP  an  amount equal
to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount (the  " **CCE 
Adjustment** ").  The  CCE Adjustment, if any, and the ETP Adjustment, if
any, shall bear simple  interest at a rate equal to daily average one month
LIBOR plus one percent  (1%)  per annum measured from the Closing Date to
the date of such payment. Amounts  owing by CCE, if any, pursuant to this
Section 2.4 shall be paid by CCE within  five (5) Business Days after the
Determination Date by delivery of immediately  available funds to an account
designated by ETP. Amounts owing by ETP, if any,  pursuant to this Section
2.4 shall be paid by ETP within five (5) Business  Days  after the
Determination Date by delivery of immediately available funds to  an 
account designated by CCE.

 

 

(d) _CCE  Capital Contributions_.  ETP  shall have no obligation to make
any capital contributions pursuant to the  CCE  LLC Agreement as the owner
of the 50% CCE Interest following the consummation  of  the transactions
contemplated by the CCE Acquisition Agreement unless this  Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Article VII hereof.

 

 

Section  2.5 _Deliveries  by CCE at the Closing_.  At the  Closing, CCE
shall deliver, or cause its appropriate Affiliates to deliver,  to  ETP:

 

 

(a) an  executed copy of the TPC Interests Assignment;

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(b) a  cross-receipt acknowledging receipt of the 50% CCE Interest 
Assignment;

 

 

(c) a  certificate from an authorized officer of CCE, dated as of the Closing
Date,  to  the effect that the conditions set forth in Section 2.3(d),

Agreement have been  satisfied;

 

 

(d) all  other  previously undelivered documents required by this Agreement
to be delivered  by  CCE or its Affiliates to ETP at or prior to the
Closing;

 

 

(e) resignations  of each of the managers and officers (or persons acting in
similar capacities)  of TPC who are not employees of TPC;

 

 

(f) the  TPC  Transition Services Agreement, duly executed by CCE and PEPL;
and

 

 

(g) all  such  other instruments of sale, assignment, conveyance and
transfer and releases,  consents and waivers as in the reasonable opinion of
ETP may be necessary to  effect the sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance
and delivery of the TPC  Interests to ETP in accordance with this Agreement,
in each case, as is  necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement.

 

 

Section  2.6 _Deliveries  by ETP at the Closing_.  At the  Closing, ETP
shall deliver to CCE:

 

 

(a) an  executed copy of the 50% CCE Interest Assignment;

 

 

(b) a  cross-receipt acknowledging receipt of the TPC Interests  Assignment;

 

 

(c) a  certificate from an authorized officer of ETP, dated as of the Closing
Date,  to  the effect that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) and
Section 6.3(c)  of  this Agreement have been satisfied;

 

 

(d) the  TPC  Transition Services Agreement, duly executed by ETP; and

 

 

(e) all  other  previously undelivered documents required by this Agreement
to be delivered  by  ETP or its Affiliates to CCE at or prior to the
Closing.

Effect. The CCE LLC  Agreement is a legal, valid and binding agreement of the

any of its Affiliates or any executive  officer, manager or director thereof
relating to the transactions contemplated  hereby or the assets or business
of TPC, except, in the case of lawsuits,  actions, proceedings,
investigations relating to the assets or business of  TPC,  as would not,

Encumbrances, in each case except for (a) Encumbrances listed in Section 
3.11 of the CCE Disclosure Letter, (b) Permitted Encumbrances and (c)

benefits, severance benefits, retention benefits,  insurance coverage
(including any self-insured arrangements), workers' compensation, disability
benefits, supplemental unemployment benefits, vacation  benefits, retirement
benefits, deferred compensation, profit-sharing, bonuses,  or other forms of
incentive compensation, or post-retirement insurance,  compensation or
benefits (whether or not an ERISA Plan) that (i) is entered  into, sponsored,
maintained, or contributed to, as the case may be, by TPC,  or  (ii) has
covered any current or former TPC Employee or independent contractor  to 
TPC since November 17, 2004. The policies, plans, agreements, and
arrangements  described in this Section 3.12(b) are hereinafter referred to
as the "Benefit  Programs or Agreements." For the avoidance of doubt, the
term **" Benefit  Programs or Agreements" **does  not  include any Enron
Plan. The Benefit Programs and Agreements and the ERISA Plans  are
hereinafter referred to collectively as the **" Employee  Benefit Plans."**

 



 

(c) True,  correct, and complete copies of each of the ERISA Plans sponsored,
maintained  or  contributed to on behalf of the TPC Employees or in which
such employees are  otherwise eligible to participate, and related trusts, if
applicable, including  all amendments thereto, have been furnished to ETP.

commitment to create, incur  liability with respect to or cause to exist any
other employee benefit plan,  program or arrangement for the benefit of any
current or former TPC Employee  or  to enter into any contract or agreement
to provide compensation or benefits  to  any former or current TPC Employee.

ERISA or a  transaction (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) intended  to evade liability under Section 4069 of ERISA, in
either case that would  subject TPC to a liability, or (b) constitute a
prohibited transaction under  Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code that would subject TPC or  any  plan fiduciary, directly or indirectly
(through indemnification obligations  or  otherwise), to an excise Tax or
civil penalty under Section 4975 of the Code  or  Section 502(i) of ERISA in
an amount that would be material;

(vii) except  to  the extent required under Section 601 of ERISA or Section
4980 of the Code,  TPC  has no present or future obligation to make any
payment to or with respect  to  any former or current TPC Employee or any
dependent of any such former or  current TPC Employee under any retiree
medical benefit plan or other retiree  welfare benefit plan;

 



 

(viii) there  is  no Employee Benefit Plan covering any former or current
TPC Employee that  provides for the payment by TPC of any amount that is or
is reasonably likely  to  be (a) not deductible as a result of Section
162(a)(1) or 404 of the Code,  (b)  an "excess parachute payment" pursuant
to Section 280G of the Code or (c)  subject to the additional tax pursuant to
Section 409A of the  Code;


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 



 

(ix) except  as  otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither the execution
of this Agreement  nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will (a) entitle  any TPC Employee to severance, retention or change

entitled, or any increase  in  severance retention or change in control

(c) Except  as  disclosed in Section 3.23(c) of the CCE Disclosure Letter,

in the periodic  reports filed by a reporting company under the Exchange Act.

 

 

Section  3.24 _Hedging_.  Except  as set forth on Section 3.24 of the CCE

Disclosure  Letter.

 

 

Section  3.26 _Gas  Imbalances_. Section 3.26 of the CCE Disclosure Letter
sets forth all gas  imbalances on TPC's pipeline system as of June 30, 2006.
All gas imbalances on  TPC's pipeline system (whether as of June 30, 2006 or
thereafter) are resolved  pursuant to the terms of Operational Balancing
Agreements (" **OBAs** ").  The  majority of OBAs follow the valuation
methodology described in TPC's tariff,  which calls for imbalances to be
resolved using a Monthly Index Price as  calculated under Section 27 of the
tariff's General Terms and Conditions and  Section 5(c) of the tariff's
Operator Balancing Agreement - Form N. TPC has  certain grandfathered
volumetric OBAs that do not follow Form N and for which  the revaluation of
outstanding volumetric imbalances impacts TPC\'s monthly  income statement.
Volumetric imbalances are noted in Section 3.26 of the CCE  Disclosure
Letter. The values of gas imbalances as determined pursuant to the  imbalance
resolution methodology set forth in the OBAs are used in preparing  each
balance sheet included in the TPC Annual Financial Statements and the  TPC 
Six Month Interim Financial Statements.

representations and  warranties contained in this Article III, neither CCE

properties, books,  contracts, commitments and records (including all
environmental studies, reports  and other environmental records and all
pipeline cost-of-service and  rate-related studies, reports and records
related to TPC and, during such  period, shall furnish to ETP all information
concerning the business,  properties, Liabilities and personnel related to
TPC as ETP may request,  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  investigation
or receipt of information pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall  affect any
representation or warranty of CCE or the conditions to the  obligations of
ETP. To the extent not located at the offices or properties  of  TPC as of
the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable thereafter, CCE shall  deliver,
or cause its appropriate Affiliates to deliver to ETP all of the books  of
accounts, minute books, record books and other records (including safety,

accounting  records related to TPC. Such  delivery shall include all work
papers, pleadings, testimony, exhibits, spread  sheets, research, drafts,
memoranda, correspondence and other documents related  to the TPC Rate Case
(" **TPC  Rate Case Work Product** ").  TPC  Rate Case Work Product has
been and will be prepared in contemplation of  litigation, and the use of TPC
Rate Case Work Product has been and will be  under  the control of TPC's
attorneys. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  contained in this
Agreement, CCE shall not be obligated to provide to ETP any  documents or
records relating to litigation and regulatory matters in which  TPC  is
involved to the extent that CCE reasonably believes such documents or
records  are subject to the attorney-client or other applicable privilege
in  circumstances in which TPC is not the sole client unless the parties 
entitled to such attorney-client or other applicable privilege shall consent 
thereto and enter into an appropriate joint defense agreement for the
purpose  of  preservation of such attorney-client or other applicable 
privilege.

 

 

(b) The  information contained herein, in the CCE Disclosure Letter or
heretofore or  hereafter delivered to ETP or its authorized representatives
in connection  with  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be held in confidence  by  ETP and its

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 


 

representatives  in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement until the
Closing Date with  respect to information relating to TPC. Following the
Closing Date, CCE shall  keep confidential all information related to the
business and properties of  TPC  to the same extent as ETP is obligated to
keep such information confidential  in  accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (without regard  to  the preceding sentence) prior
to the Closing Date.

 

 

Section  5.3 _Consents  and Approvals_.

 

 

(a) Upon  the  terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each
of the parties  hereto agrees to use, and will cause its Affiliates to use
its commercially  reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or  cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable
under Applicable Law and  regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement as promptly as practicable
including the preparation and filing  of all forms, registrations and notices
required to be filed by such party  in  order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the taking  of all appropriate action
necessary, proper or advisable to satisfy each of  the  conditions to
Closing that are to be satisfied by that party or any of its  Affiliates and
the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any  approvals,
consents, orders, exemptions or waivers of Governmental Authorities  and any
other Person required to be obtained by such party in order to  consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Each  party shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, with
respect to  a  threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or
other order, decree  or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive
order that would adversely  affect the ability of any party to this Agreement
to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby or those contemplated by
the CCE Acquisition Agreement,  use  their respective commercially
reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry,  enactment or promulgation
thereof, as the case may be (including by pursuing  any  available appeal
process). Each of ETP and CCE shall use its respective  commercially
reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause their respective  Affiliates to
use their commercially reasonable best efforts to, promptly take  or cause to
be taken all actions necessary to comply with any requests made,  or 
conditions set, by a Governmental Authority to consummate the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement or the CCE Acquisition Agreement. Each party 
agrees to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to procure any  third-
party consents required in the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, in no event shall the term "commercially reasonable best
efforts" require a party to agree to any divestiture, agreement, condition,
restriction  or requirement requested by any Governmental Entity to avoid the
entry,  enactment or promulgation of any threatened preliminary or permanent
injunction  or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or
executive  order  that would constitute a material adverse effect on the
financial condition,  results of operations or prospects of such party and
its Affiliates (including,  with respect to ETP, TPC), taken as a whole (a "
**Burdensome  Condition** ").  All  cooperation shall be conducted in such
a manner so as to preserve all applicable  privileges.

 

 

(c) By  the  later of (i) the seventh Business Day after the date hereof and
(ii) the fifth  Business Day after the approval by the FCC of the transfer of
control  contemplated by the CCE Acquisition Agreement, CCE and ETP shall
file  applications with the FCC for consent to the transfer of control of CCE
and  its  Affiliates as contemplated by this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(d) For  purposes of this Section 5.3, each party shall require their
respective counsel  to cooperate to the same extent as each party is required
to cooperate with  the  other party.

 

 

(e) Without  limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 5.3 and  subject to appropriate confidentiality protections and
limitations set forth  in  Section 5.3(b) above, CCE, ETP and their
respective Affiliates shall each  furnish to the parties to this Agreement
such necessary information and  reasonable assistance a party may request in
connection with the foregoing  and,  upon reasonable request shall each
provide counsel for the other party with  copies of all filings made by such
party or such Affiliate, and all  correspondence between such party or such
Affiliate (and its advisors) with  any  Governmental Authority and any other
information supplied by such party and  such  party's Affiliates to a
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement  and the
transactions contemplated hereby, _provided,  however_ ,  that  materials
may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation  of  TPC,
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) to 
remove information that is proprietary; and _provided  further_ ,  that 
information protected by the attorney client, work product privilege, or any 
other applicable privilege, shall be exchanged in a manner so as to preserve 
any  such privilege. CCE and ETP agree to inform each other of all
communications  with any Governmental Authority.

 

 

Section  5.4 _Further  Assurances_.  On and  after the Closing Date, CCE
and ETP shall cooperate and use their respective  commercially reasonable
efforts to take or cause to be taken all appropriate  actions and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary or appropriate to  consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including  the execution of
any additional documents or instruments of any kind, the  obtaining of
consents which may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry  out any
of the provisions hereof and the taking of all such other actions as  such
party may reasonably be requested to take by the other party hereto from 
time to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in order to 
effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Agreement and the
transactions  contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section  5.5 _Employee  Matters_.

 

 

(a) Except  as  provided in the following sentence, on the Closing Date, CCE
shall terminate  the  active participation of the Affected Employees in all
of the Employee Benefit  Plans listed in Sections 3.12(a) and 3.12(b) of the
CCE Disclosure Letter,  except for (i) the Benefit Programs and Agreements
listed as Items 5 and 6  in  Section 3.12(b) of the CCE Disclosure Letter,
(ii) the TPC VEBA and (iii) the  life and long term disability insurance
coverage contemplated by Section 5.5(b).  Prior to the Closing Date, CCE
shall, or shall cause TPC to, terminate the  TPC  Severance Plan. CCE shall
notify Affected Employees of the termination of such  active participation
and the termination of the TPC Severance Plan prior to  the  Closing Date.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, after the Closing  Date, TPC
shall be solely responsible for all obligations and Liabilities with  respect
to the Benefit Programs and Agreements listed as Items 5 and 6 in  Section
3.12(b) of the CCE Disclosure Letter, the TPC VEBA, the retiree medical 
benefits addressed in Section 5.5(e), the accrued vacation days addressed in 
Section 5.5(c), the flexible benefit plan accounts addressed in Section
5.5(h),  and each employee benefit policy, plan, agreement or arrangement
that TPC,  ETP  or an Affiliate of either establishes, maintains or
contributes to with respect  to the TPC Employees, on or after the


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Closing  Date, and no such obligations or Liabilities shall be assumed or
retained by  CCE  or its Affiliates. ETP shall, or shall cause TPC to, honor
any continuing pay  or  salary obligations and any applicable legal or
contractual rights to  reinstatement with respect to all Affected Employees.
Except as provided in  the  preceding provisions of this Section 5.5(a) and
in Section 5.5(e), CCE shall  retain all obligations or Liabilities and
assets with respect to current and  former TPC Employees and any Shared
Service Employees who do not become  Transferring Shared Service Employees in
accordance with Section 5.5(g) or  otherwise under all of the Employee
Benefit Plans listed in Sections 3.12(a)  and  3.12(b) of the CCE Disclosure
Letter and all other employee benefit plans,  policies and arrangements of
CCE and its ERISA Affiliates, and no such  obligations or Liabilities shall
be assumed or retained by ETP or its  Affiliates, including after the
transactions contemplated hereby,  TPC.

 



 

(b) Any  Affected Employee who is unable to report to work with TPC as of the
Closing  Date due to disability shall continue to be eligible for any
applicable  long-term disability and life insurance coverage pursuant to
CCE's or PEPL's  long-term disability and life insurance plans until such
time, if any, as such  Affected Employee returns to active employment with
TPC; provided, however,  that  in order to be eligible for such benefits,
each such Affected Employee, pending  approval for long-term disability
benefits or return to active employment,  must  continue to pay all
applicable long-term disability and life insurance premiums  due following
the Closing Date for such coverage. ETP shall, or shall cause  TPC  to, pay
Affected Employees who are on short-term disability as of the Closing  Date
the short-term disability benefits that apply under the short-term 
disability program that covers the TPC Employees as of the date of this 
Agreement. Any Affected Employees who are on short-term disability as of the 
Closing Date but who subsequently transition to long-term disability shall 
be  eligible for, and covered by, CCE's or PEPL's, as applicable, long-term 
disability and life insurance coverages but not ETP's long-term disability
and  life insurance coverages, subject to the provisions of this Section
5.5(b). 

 



 

(c) For  no  less than one year following the Closing Date, ETP shall, and
shall cause TPC  to, provide to Affected Employees those employee benefits
that are provided  by  ETP to its similarly situated employees except with
respect to short-term  disability benefits, as provided in Section 5.5(b).
With respect to those  employee benefit plans of TPC, ETP or their Affiliates
in which Affected  Employees may participate on or after the Closing Date (
**" ETP  Plans"**),  ETP  shall cause the ETP Plans to credit prior service
of the Affected Employees  with  TPC, PEPL and the Affiliates of either,
past or present, for purposes of  eligibility and vesting under ETP Plans and
for all purposes with respect to  any  vacation, sick days, severance and
post-retirement medical benefits; provided,  however, that such service need
not be credited to the extent it would result  in  a duplication of
benefits. Following the Closing Date, ETP shall, or shall  cause  TPC to,
honor the accrued vacation days of the Affected Employees that remain  unused
as of the Closing Date to the extent such accruals are shown, either  as 
accruals for TPC Employees or full-time equivalent employees providing
services  to TPC, on the Closing Balance Sheet. Affected Employees shall also
be given  credit for any deductible or co-insurance payment amounts payable
in respect  of  the ETP Plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, to the
extent that,  following the Closing Date, they participate in any ETP Plan
during such plan  year for which deductibles or co-payments are required. Any
preexisting  condition restrictions and waiting period limitations that were
deemed satisfied  with respect to a particular person under


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  

 

 

 

 

 


 

any  Employee Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan that covered a
Transferring  Shared Service Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date
shall be deemed  satisfied by ETP and its Affiliates under ETP Plans with
respect to such person  on and after the Closing Date. The provisions of this
Section 5.5(c) and Section  5.5(f) shall not alter the status of the Affected
Employees as at-will employees  of TPC or its Affiliates. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement,  the provisions of this Section 5.5(c) and
Section 5.5(f) shall not affect the  right of TPC, ETP or any of their
Affiliates to amend or terminate any of their  employee benefit plans,
programs or arrangements with respect to ETP employees  generally.

 



 

(d) ETP  shall  be responsible for all Liabilities and obligations under the
Worker Adjustment  and Retraining Notification Act and similar foreign, state
and local rules,  statutes and ordinances resulting from the actions of ETP
or TPC after the  Closing Date. ETP agrees to hold CCE harmless in accordance
with Article VIII  for any breach of such responsibility and ETP's
indemnification of CCE in this  regard specifically includes any Claim by the
Affected Employees for back pay,  front pay, benefits or compensatory or
punitive damages, any Claim by any  Governmental Authority for penalties
regarding any issue of prior notification  (or lack thereof) of any plant
closing or mass layoff occurring after the  Closing Date and CCE's costs,
including reasonable attorney's fees, in defending  any such Claims.

 



 

(e) TPC  has  established the TPC VEBA, the assets and liabilities of which
will be retained  by TPC as of the Closing Date. TPC is or will be
responsible for those  post-retirement medical benefits described in Section
3.12(e)(vii) of the CCE  Disclosure Letter or described in and/or valued
under the CCE FAS 106 Report.  In  addition to the CCE FAS 106 Report, the
Enron Inactive Medical Plan sets forth  eligibility requirements relating to
post-retirement medical benefits available  to eligible current and former
employees and retirees of TPC (and their eligible  spouses, surviving spouses
and dependents). The post-retirement medical benefits  that TPC currently
provides to eligible retirees (and their eligible spouses,  surviving spouses
and dependents) are described in the CCE Under Age 65 SPD  and  the CCE
Medicare Eligible SPD. The employer subsidies that TPC currently makes 
available under cost sharing arrangements with respect to post-retirement 
medical benefits are described in the CCE FAS 106 Report as well as in a 
November 9, 2005 letter to then current TPC employees who had satisfied 
applicable age, service and hire date eligibility requirements. Both the CCE 
FAS  106 Report and the November 9, 2005 letter describe fixed dollar per
year of  service employer subsidies for eligible post-1989 retirees (and
their eligible  spouses, surviving spouses and dependents). The CCE FAS 106
Report describes  a  60 percent employer subsidy for eligible pre-1990
retirees (and their eligible  spouses, surviving spouses and dependents).
True and complete copies of the  CCE  FAS 106 Report, the Enron Inactive
Medical Plan, the CCE Under Age 65 SPD and  the CCE Medicare Eligible SPD, as
well as the November 9, 2005 letter have  been  provided to ETP. Effective
as of the Closing Date, ETP shall, or shall cause  TPC  to, establish a plan
to provide post-retirement medical benefits to eligible  current and former
employees and retirees of TPC (and their eligible spouses,  surviving spouses
and dependents). The eligibility requirements and employer  subsidies under
such plan shall be as described in the CCE FAS 106 Report and/or  the Enron
Inactive Medical Plan, and such eligibility requirements and employer 
subsidies shall be applied to all Affected Employees, including all
Transferring  Shared Service Employees, with such Transferring Shared Service
Employees  receiving prior service credit in accordance with the provisions
of Section  5.5(c). Any provision of this


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Agreement  to the contrary notwithstanding, TPC shall, and ETP shall cause
TPC to, take  all  actions with respect to the partition and distribution of
assets and liabilities  associated with the Enron VEBA as may be required of
TPC by, or contemplated  with respect to TPC under, any order of the
Bankruptcy Court relating to the  Enron VEBA Motion or any order of any other
court of competent jurisdiction  relating to the partition of assets held
under the Enron VEBA and/or the  distribution of liabilities associated with
the Enron VEBA. For the avoidance  of  doubt, pursuant to the preceding
sentence, TPC shall assume liabilities and  the  TPC VEBA shall receive
certain allocated assets with respect to current and  former employees and
retirees of TPC, former employees and retirees of former  affiliates of TPC
who provided services to TPC, and their respective eligible  spouses,
surviving spouses and dependents, all in accordance with the terms  of  an
order relating to the Enron VEBA Motion or any other order of a court of 
competent jurisdiction relating to the partition and distribution of assets 
and  liabilities under the Enron VEBA, and all such individuals shall be
eligible  to  participate in the post-retirement medical benefits plan
established by TPC  or  ETP under this Section 5.5(e). Except as otherwise
indicated in Section  3.12(e)(vii) of the CCE Disclosure Letter or as
otherwise required by Applicable  Law or the provisions of a final order
entered in connection with the Enron  VEBA  Motion or by another court of
competent jurisdiction relating to the partition  and distribution of assets
and liabilities under the Enron VEBA, nothing in  this  Agreement shall
prohibit TPC or CCE **** from  exercising their respective rights as the
sponsor of TPC's post-retirement  medical benefits **** program  to amend,
modify or terminate the benefits provided thereunder, whether before  or
after the Closing Date; provided, however, that between the date hereof 
and  the Closing Date, CCE shall not amend its post-retirement medical
benefits  program to increase the benefits provided thereunder, reduce
retiree  contribution or premium rates for coverage thereunder or expand
eligibility  under such programs.

 



 

(f) In  the  event that, on the Closing Date or during the Continuation
Period, (i) the  employment of an Affected Employee is terminated by TPC, ETP
or an Affiliate  of  either other than For Cause, (ii) TPC, ETP or an
Affiliate of either fails  to  provide an Affected Employee with at least
the same level of Base Compensation  as was in effect immediately prior to
the Closing Date, or (iii) without the  consent of an Affected Employee, TPC,
ETP or an Affiliate of either changes  the  primary work location of such
Affected Employee to a location that is more  than  50 miles away from the
Affected Employee's primary work location immediately  prior to the Closing
Date, ETP shall be responsible for and shall pay to such  Affected Employee,
in a lump sum payment, not later than sixty (60) days  following the date of
the Affected Employee's termination of employment, the  following severance
benefits (the **" Severance  Benefits"**):  two  (2) weeks of the Affected
Employee's Base Compensation for each full or partial  year of service
measured from the Affected Employee's date of hire reflected in  Section
5.5(g) of the CCE Disclosure Letter, not to exceed fifty-two (52) weeks  of
such Base Compensation; provided, however, that in no event shall such 
Severance Benefits be less than eight (8) weeks of such Base Compensation. 
The  costs incurred directly or indirectly in connection with the termination
of  employment of any Affected Employee on or after the Closing Date shall be
borne  exclusively by ETP. ETP's obligation to provide the Severance Benefits
shall be  subject to the Affected Employee's execution of a release of all
claims against  TPC, ETP and the Affiliates of either, and CCE, PEPL and the
Affiliates of  either, in a form reasonably satisfactory to ETP and CCE. For
purposes of this  Section 5.5(f), **" Continuation  Period"**  shall  mean
the one-year period following the Closing Date. For purposes of this  Section

5.5,  **" For  Cause" **shall  mean (i) the commission by the Affected
Employee of a criminal or other act  that  causes or is reasonably likely to
cause substantial economic damage to TPC  or  substantial injury to the
business reputation of TPC, (ii) the commission by  the  Affected Employee
of an act of fraud, theft or financial dishonesty in the  performance of the
Affected Employee's duties on behalf of TPC, (iii) the  continuing failure or
continuing refusal of the Affected Employee to  satisfactorily perform the
duties of the Affected Employee to TPC, (iv) the  material disregard or
violation by the Affected Employee of the legal rights  of  any employees of
TPC or of TPC's written policies regarding harassment or  discrimination, or
(v) any other conduct materially detrimental to TPC's  business. For purposes
of this Section 5.5(f), **" Base  Compensation"**  shall  mean an Affected
Employee's base hourly wages or base salary, as applicable, at  termination
of employment; provided, however, that in no event shall an Affected 
Employee's Base Compensation for purposes of calculating the Severance
Benefits  provided for under this Section 5.5(f) be less than such Affected
Employee's  base hourly wages or base salary, as applicable, in effect as of
the date of  this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, two weeks of each
Affected  Employee's Base Compensation as of the date of this Agreement is
reflected in  the "BiWkly Salary" columns in Section 5.5(g) of the CCE
Disclosure  Letter.

 



 

(g)   Section  5.5(g) of the CCE Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of the
TPC Employees  as of  the date hereof, including each such TPC Employee's
current annual base  compensation, annual bonus, job title, work location,
hire date, and vacation  balance as of the date of this Agreement, as well as
two weeks of each such  TPC  Employee's Base Compensation as of the date of
this Agreement, as reflected in  the "BiWkly Salary" columns, for purposes of
Section 5.5(f). Also listed in  Section 5.5(g) of the CCE Disclosure Letter,
as it may be amended as  contemplated by this Section 5.5(g), are employees
of CCES or PEPL on the date  of this Agreement, who provide services to TPC,
and who are being made available  for transfer to TPC on the date immediately
preceding the Closing Date pursuant  to the provisions of this Section 5.5(g)
( **" Shared  Service Employees"**).  With  respect to each Shared Service
Employee, Section 5.5(g) of the CCE Disclosure  Letter sets forth, as of the
date hereof, such Shared Service Employee's current  annual base
compensation, annual bonus, job title, work location, hire date,  and 
vacation balance as of the date of this Agreement, as well as two weeks of 
each  such Shared Service Employee's Base Compensation as of the date of
this  Agreement, as reflected in the "BiWkly Salary" columns, for purposes of
Section  5.5(f). In the event that CCE or ETP requests that the list of
Shared Service  Employees be amended, by adding an employee to the list or
deleting an employee  from the list within the first thirty (30) days
following the execution of  this  Agreement, the parties agree to negotiate
in good faith to determine if such  request can be accommodated. Not later
than thirty (30) days following the  execution of this Agreement, ETP may
identify to CCE, in writing, not more  than  five (5) Shared Service
Employees who shall not be transferred to TPC. Each  Shared Service Employee
not so identified by ETP shall be considered a  **" Transferring  Shared
Service Employee" **under  this Agreement. All of the Transferring Shared
Service Employees shall be  transferred to TPC, and become employees of TPC,
on the date preceding the  Closing Date. CCE shall pay, or CCE shall cause
CCES or PEPL, as applicable,  to  pay any severance costs relating to any
Shared Service Employees who do not  become Transferring Shared Service
Employees under the preceding provisions  of  this Section 5.5(g). In
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.5(f), ETP  shall pay the
Severance Benefits, if any, relating to any Shared Service  Employees who
become Transferring Shared Service Employees under the preceding  provisions
of this Section 5.5(g). ETP shall, or shall


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 


 

cause  TPC  to, pay each Affected Employee a base hourly wage or base
salary, as applicable,  that is not less than his or her base hourly wage or
base salary, as applicable,  in effect with TPC, CCES or PEPL, as applicable,
immediately prior to the  Closing Date. CCE agrees that, within the thirty
(30) day period following  the  execution of this Agreement, neither CCES
nor PEPL shall terminate the  employment of any Shared Service Employee other
than For Cause, without the  written consent of ETP. CCE further agrees that,
prior to the Closing Date,  neither CCES nor PEPL shall terminate the
employment of any Transferring Shared  Service Employee other than For Cause,
without the written consent of ETP. 

 



 

(h) As  soon  as administratively feasible after the Closing Date, CCE and
PEPL shall transfer  to ETP's flexible benefits plan, an amount, in cash,
equal to any health care  and dependent care balances standing to the credit
of Affected Employees under  the CCE and PEPL flexible benefit plans (the **"
CCE  Flex Plans"**)  as of  the day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
and ETP shall, or shall cause  TPC to, reimburse Affected Employees for all
eligible health and dependent  care  expenses that would otherwise be
payable under the terms of the CCE Flex Plans  on or after the Closing Date.
As soon as administratively feasible after the  Closing Date, CCE shall
provide to ETP a list of those Affected Employees who  have participated in
the health or dependent care reimbursement accounts under  the CCE Flex
Plans, together with their elections made prior to the Closing  Date  with
respect to such accounts, and balances standing to their credit as of  the 
day immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(i) Affected  Employees will be eligible to participate in the Energy
Transfer Partners Profit  Sharing and 401(k) Plan (the **" ETP  401(k)
Plan"**)  following the Closing Date. ETP shall take reasonable measures
designed to  facilitate the ETP 401(k) Plan's acceptance from any Affected
Employee of a  rollover or direct rollover of all of his or her account
balances under the  CrossCountry Energy Savings Plan 001, the CrossCountry
Energy Savings Plan  002  and/or the Southern Union Savings Plan (each a **"
CCE  Defined Contribution Plan"**),  including his or her loan balances and
related loan documentation under the  CCE  Defined Contribution Plan(s);
provided that an Affected Employee shall only  be  permitted to roll over
his or her loan balances and related loan documentation  if the Affected
Employee makes a rollover or direct rollover of all of his  or  her account
balances under the CCE Defined Contribution Plan or Plans which  include the
Affected Employee's outstanding loan balances. The trustee or  recordkeeper
of CCE's Defined Contribution Plans shall transfer to the trustee  or
recordkeeper of the ETP 401(k) Plan any loan documentation for loans to  be 
rolled over or transferred to the ETP 401(k) Plan pursuant to the provisions 
of  this Section 5.5(i). The provisions of this Section 5.5(i) shall not be 
construed to require that any Affected Employee roll over or otherwise
transfer  his or her account balances under a CCE Defined Contribution Plan
to the ETP  401(k) Plan. CCE shall, or shall cause PEPL to, fully vest the
account balances  of all Affected Employees under the CCE Defined
Contribution Plans.

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding  any provisions of the Southern Union Company Annual
Incentive Plan (the " **Annual  Incentive Plan** ")  to the  contrary, no
payment for the 2006 Plan Year (as defined in the Annual Incentive  Plan)
shall be made to any Affected Employee, and including any accelerated 
payment pursuant to Section VI of the Annual Incentive Plan), except as
provided  in this Section 5.5(j). On or before March 15, 2007, ETP shall, or
shall cause  TPC to, pay to the Affected Employees the amount determined by
multiplying,  the  sum of the total of


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 


 

the  amounts reflected in the "Amount at Midpt" column for the TPC Employees
as set  forth in Section 5.5(g) of the CCE Disclosure Letter plus the total
of the  amounts reflected in the "Amount at Midpt" column for the Shared
Service  Employees who become Affected Employees as set forth in Section
5.5(g) of the  CCE Disclosure Letter (as it may be amended pursuant to
Section 5.5(g)), by  a  fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
completed calendar months  in  2006 occurring on or before the Closing Date,
and the denominator of which  is  twelve (12). Each such Affected Employee
who is employed by ETP, TPC or an  affiliate of either on the date that the
amount determined under the preceding  sentence is paid shall receive a
percentage, that is not less than nor greater  than the percentage reflected
in the individual Affected Employee's "Target  Bonus Range," of such Affected
Employee's "Annual Salary" as reflected in  Section 5.5(g) of the CCE
Disclosure Letter (as it may be amended pursuant  to  Section 5.5(g)),
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number  of completed
calendar months in 2006 occurring on or before the Closing Date,  and the
denominator of which is twelve (12). Notwithstanding the foregoing 
provisions of this Section 5.5(j), no payments for the 2006 Plan Year under 
the  Annual Incentive Plan shall be made to the extent that they are not
accrued  for  the Annual Incentive Plan on the Closing Balance Sheet.

 

 

  (k) Until the Closing Date, CCE shall provide ETP an opportunity to
particpate  with TPC as a participating employer in discussions regarding the
Enron VEBA  Motion, including the allocation of assets and liabilities to TPC
thereunder,  and in settlement negotiations, if any, relating to any
proceeding in another  court of compentent jurisdiction relating to the
partition and distribution  of  assets and liabilitites under the Enron
VEBA.

 



 

 

Section  5.6 _Tax  Covenants._

 

 

(a) _Tax  Return Filings, Refunds, and Credits_.

 

 

(i) CCE  shall  timely prepare and file (or cause such preparation and
filing) with the  appropriate Tax authorities all Tax Returns (including any
Consolidated Income  Tax Returns) due on or before the 30th day following the
Closing Date required  to be filed by or on behalf of TPC (and make all
elections with respect to  such  Tax Returns) for Tax periods that end on or
before the Closing Date, and CCE  may  timely prepare and file (or cause
such preparation and filing) with the  appropriate Tax authorities all other
Tax Returns (including any Consolidated  Income Tax Returns) required to be
filed by or on behalf of TPC (and make all  elections with respect to such
Tax Returns) for Tax periods that end on or  before the Closing Date (all
such returns required to be prepared and filed  or  actually prepared and
filed by CCE, the " **CCE  Returns** ").

 

 

**(ii)** ETP  shall  timely prepare and file (or cause such preparation and
filing) with the  appropriate Tax authorities all Tax Returns (the "
**Straddle  Period Returns** ")  required to be filed by or on behalf of TPC
(and make all elections with respect  to such Tax Returns) for all Tax
periods ending after the Closing Date that  include the Closing Date (the "
**Straddle  Period** "),  and  ETP shall timely prepare and file (or cause
such preparation and filing) with  the appropriate Tax authorities all Tax
Returns required to be filed by or  on  behalf of TPC (and make all
elections with respect to such Tax Returns) for  Tax  periods that end on or
before the Closing Date, other than CCE Returns (all  such  returns required
to be prepared and filed by ETP, the " **ETP  Returns "**).  All  ETP
Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past practice to the extent 
consistent with applicable law and the operations of TPC. ETP shall provide 
CCE  with copies of any ETP Returns at least forty-five (45) days prior to
the due  date thereof (giving effect to any extensions thereto), accompanied
by a  statement (the " **Straddle **

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 


 

**Statement** ")  setting forth and calculating in reasonable detail the Pre-
Closing Taxes as  defined below. If CCE agrees with the ETP Return and
Straddle Statement, the  amount of Pre-Closing Taxes shall be as shown
thereon. If, within fifteen (15)  days of the receipt of the ETP Return and
Straddle Statement, CCE notifies  ETP  that it disputes the manner of
preparation of the ETP Return or the amount  calculated in the Straddle
Statement, and provides ETP its proposed form of  ETP  Return, a statement
setting forth and calculating in reasonable detail the  Pre-Closing Taxes,
and a written or oral explanation of the reasons for its  adjustment, then
ETP and CCE shall attempt to resolve their disagreement within  the five (5)
days following CCE's notification or ETP of such disagreement. If  ETP and
CCE are unable to resolve their disagreement, the dispute shall be  submitted
to a mutually agreed upon nationally recognized independent accounting  firm,
whose expense shall be borne equally by ETP and CCE, for resolution within 
twenty (20) days of such submission. The decision of such accounting firm
with  respect to such dispute shall be binding upon ETP and CCE.

 

 

(iii) From  and  after the Closing Date, ETP and its Affiliates (including
TPC) will not file  any  amended Tax Return, carryback claim or other
adjustment request by or on behalf  of TPC for any Tax period that includes
or ends on or before the Closing Date  unless CCE consents in writing.

 

 

(iv) For  purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of TPC that
are payable  with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such
Taxes that  constitutes " **Pre-Closing  Taxes** " shall  be the excess of
(A) (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon  or  related to
income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale,  transfer or
assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property  (real or
personal, tangible or intangible) be deemed equal to the amount that  would
be payable if the Tax period ended at the close of business on the Closing 
Date and (ii) in the case of Taxes (other than those described in clause
(i))  imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of
TPC,  be  deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period (or, in  the  case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
amount of such Taxes  for  the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied
by a fraction the numerator  of  which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period  ending on and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the  number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period over (B) any prepayment  or  advances of Taxes or any
payments of estimated Taxes with respect to the  Straddle Period. For
purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, any  exemption, deduction,
credit or other item that is calculated on an annual  basis  shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing  Date
on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the total amount of such 
item  allocated to the Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the  number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the  Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar
days in  the  entire Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax based upon or
measured by capital  (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles,
any amount thereof  required to be allocated under this Section 5.6(a)(iv)
shall be computed by  reference to the level of such items at the close of
business on the Closing  Date. The parties hereto will, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, elect  with the relevant Tax authority to treat
a portion of any Straddle Period as  a  short taxable period ending as of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 


 

the  close  of business on the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement,
" **Post-Closing  Taxes** " shall  include any Taxes of TPC that are
payable with respect to a Straddle Period,  except for the portion of any
such Taxes that constitutes Pre-Closing Taxes.  For  purposes of this
Agreement, the Texas corporate franchise tax determined based  on the income
or capital of any entity for the year during which the Closing  Date occurs
shall be considered to be a Tax due with respect to the Straddle  Period.

 

 

(v) CCE  and  ETP shall reasonably cooperate in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns required  to be filed by or on behalf of TPC, including maintaining
and making available  to each other all records reasonably necessary in
connection with Taxes of  TPC  and in resolving all disputes and audits with
respect to all Tax periods  relating to Taxes of TPC.

 

 

(vi) For  a  period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, CCE and its
representatives  shall have reasonable access to the books and records
(including the right  to  make extracts thereof) of TPC to the extent that
such books and records relate  to Taxes and to the extent that such access
may reasonably be required by CCE  in  connection with matters relating to
or affected by the operation of TPC prior  to  the Closing Date. Such access
shall be afforded by ETP upon receipt of  reasonable advance notice and
during normal business hours. If ETP shall desire  to dispose of any of such
books and records prior to the expiration of such  six-year period, ETP
shall, prior to such disposition, give CCE a reasonable  opportunity, at
CCE's expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as  CCE may
select.

 

 

(vii) If  a Tax  Indemnified Party receives a refund or credit or other
reimbursement with  respect to Taxes for which it was indemnified under this
Agreement, the Tax  Indemnified Party shall pay over such refund or credit or
other reimbursement  to  the Tax Indemnifying Party.

 

 

(viii) ETP  shall  not, and shall cause TPC to not, make, amend or revoke
any Tax election if  such  action would adversely affect any of CCE or its
Affiliates with respect to  any  Tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date or for the Pre-Closing Period  or  any Tax refund with respect thereto
unless ETP and its Affiliates indemnify  and  make CCE and its Affiliates
whole for any detriment or cost incurred (or to  be  incurred) by them as a
result of such action.

 

 

(ix) For  purposes of this Agreement a " **Consolidated  Income Tax Return**
" is  any  income Tax Return filed with respect to any consolidated,
combined, affiliated  or unified group provided for under Section 1501 of the
Code and the Treasury  regulations under Section 1502 of the Code, or any
comparable provisions of  state or local law, other than any income Tax
Return that includes only  TPC.

 

 

(b) _Indemnity  for Taxes_.

 

 

(i) CCE  hereby agrees to indemnify ETP and its affiliates against and hold
them harmless  from and against all liability for (A) all Taxes that are
attributable to CCE  or  any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined
or unitary Tax group of 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 


 

which  TPC  (or any direct or indirect predecessor(s) of TPC) was a member
at any time  on or  prior to the Closing Date and not after the Closing Date
that is imposed under  Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local  or foreign Tax law), except to the extent
reflected on the TPC Six Month Interim  Financial Statements, (B) any Taxes
of TPC incurred as a transferee or a  successor relating to any full or
partial Tax period ending on or before the  Closing Date, except to the
extent reflected on the TPC Six Month Interim  Financial Statements, (C)
CCE's portion of Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section  5.6(f), and (D) any
Damages arising out of, resulting from, or incurred in  connection with any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty  set  forth in
Section 3.16; _provided,  however_ ,  that  the determination of whether
such a breach or inaccuracy of Section 3.16(c),  (d), or (e) occurred will be
made without the Material Adverse Effect  qualifications contained therein.

 

 

(ii) ETP  hereby agrees to indemnify CCE and its Affiliates against and hold
them harmless  from all liability for (A) all Taxes of TPC with respect to
all Tax periods  beginning after the Closing Date, (B) Post-Closing Taxes
with respect to any  Straddle Period, (C) ETP's portion of Transfer Taxes
pursuant to Section 5.6(f),  (D) all Taxes imposed on TPC with respect to Tax
periods ending on or before  the  Closing Date, and (E) Pre-Closing Taxes
with respect to any Straddle  Period.

 

 

(iii) The  obligation of CCE to indemnify and hold harmless ETP, on the one
hand, and  the  obligations of ETP to indemnify and hold harmless CCE, on
the other hand,  pursuant to this Section 5.6, shall terminate upon the
expiration of the  applicable statutes of limitations with respect to the Tax
Liabilities in  question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof) or  if a  Claim is brought with respect thereto, until
such time as such Claim is  resolved.

 

 

(c) _Certain  Payments_.  ETP and  CCE agree to treat (and cause their
Affiliates to treat) any payment by CCE  under Section 5.6(b) as an
adjustment to the property distributed by CCE to  ETP  in redemption of the
50% CCE Interest for all Tax purposes.

 

 

(d) _Contests_.

 

 

(i) After  the  Closing Date, CCE and ETP each shall notify the other party
in writing within  ten (10) days of the commencement of any Tax audit or
administrative or judicial  proceeding affecting the Taxes of TPC that, if
determined adversely to the  taxpayer (the " **Tax  Indemnified Party** ") 
or  after the lapse of time would be grounds for indemnification under this
Section  5.6 by the other party (the " **Tax  Indemnifying Party** " and 
a " **Tax  Claim** ").  Such  notice shall contain factual information
describing any asserted Tax liability  in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document  received from any Tax authority in
respect of any such asserted Tax liability.  Failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided  in this Section
5.6 except to the extent the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have  been
prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the Tax Indemnifying 
Party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in
which  the Tax Indemnified Party failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the
Tax  Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Tax Indemnifying Party, as
promptly  as  possible but in no event later than ten (10)

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 


 

days  after the Tax Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all
relevant  notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Tax
Indemnified  Party.

 

 

(ii) In  the  case of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
involving any asserted  liability for Taxes relating to any Taxable years or
periods ending on or before  the Closing Date, CCE shall have the right, at
its expense, to control the  conduct of such audit or proceeding;
_provided,  however_ ,  that if  CCE does not timely take control of such
audit or proceeding, ETP may, at its  expense, control the conduct of the
audit or proceeding. In the case of an  audit  or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted liability for  Taxes relating to any
Straddle Period, ETP shall have the right, at its expense,  to control the
conduct of such audit or proceeding; _provided,  however_ ,  that  (A) ETP
shall keep CCE reasonably informed with respect to the status of such  audit
or proceeding and provide CCE with copies of all written correspondence  with
respect to such audit or proceeding in a timely manner and (B) if such  audit
or proceeding would be reasonably expected to result in a material  increase
in Tax liability of TPC for which CCE would be liable under this  Section
5.6, CCE may participate in the conduct of such audit or proceeding  at  its
own expense.

 

 

(iii) In  the  case of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
involving any asserted  liability for Taxes relating to any Taxable years or
periods beginning after  the  Closing Date, ETP shall have the right, at its
expense, to control the conduct  of such audit or proceeding.

 

 

(iv) ETP  and  CCE shall reasonably cooperate in connection with any Tax
Claim, and such  cooperation shall include the provision to the Tax
Indemnifying Party of records  and information that are reasonably relevant
to such Tax Claim and making  employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional  information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.

 

 

(e) _Transfer  and Similar Taxes_.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement to the contrary, all  sales, use, transfer, gains, stamp,
duties, recording and similar Taxes, but  not  including any Federal or
state income taxes (collectively, " **Transfer  Taxes** ")  incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  shall be
borne equally by ETP and CCE, and CCE shall accurately file all  necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes  and 
timely pay all such Transfer Taxes. If required by Applicable Law, ETP will 
join  in the execution of any such Return. CCE shall provide copies of any
Tax Returns  with respect to Transfer Taxes to ETP no later than five (5)
days after the  due  dates of such Tax Returns.

 

 

(f) _Termination  of Tax Sharing Agreements_.  On or  prior to the Closing
Date, CCE shall cause all Tax sharing agreements between  CCE or any of its
Affiliates (as determined immediately after the Closing Date)  on the one
hand, and TPC on the other hand, to be terminated, and all  obligations
thereunder shall be settled, and no additional payments shall be  made under
any provisions thereof after the Closing Date.

 

 

Section  5.7 _Control  of Administrative and Regulatory Proceedings_.  CCE
and  ETP agree and acknowledge that, up to the Closing Date, CCE shall be
entitled  to  control, defend and

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 


 

otherwise  conduct any administrative or regulatory proceeding involving TPC.
CCE will  use  commercially reasonable efforts to, and will cause TPC to,
conduct any  administrative or regulatory proceeding in a manner that is
intended to maximize  the value of TPC on and after the Closing Date. The
Parties agree and  acknowledge that, prior to the Closing Date, ETP shall be
entitled to  participate at its expense in any administrative or regulatory
proceeding,  meeting, or settlement conference, in administrative or
regulatory proceedings  involving or affecting TPC. The Parties agree and
acknowledge that, after the  Closing Date, ETP will assume control of any
administrative or regulatory  proceeding involving or affecting TPC subject
to the terms of the TPC Transition  Services Agreement.

 

 

Section  5.8 _Maintenance  of Insurance Policies_.

 

 

(a) CCE  and  ETP agree that to the extent the Insurance Policies provide
coverage, CCE will  process the Casualty Insurance Claims relating to the
business of TPC (including  reported claims and including incurred but not
reported claims) and that such  Casualty Insurance Claims shall remain with
TPC following the Closing. For  purposes hereof, " **Casualty  Insurance
Claims** " shall  mean workers' compensation, auto liability, general
liability and products  liability claims and claims for damages caused to the
facilities of TPC  generally insured under all risk, real property, boiler
and mechanical breakdown  insurance coverage all with dates of occurrence
prior to the date of Closing.  The Casualty Insurance Claims are subject to
the provisions of the Insurance  Policies with insurance carriers and
contractual arrangements with insurance  adjusters maintained by CCE or its
Affiliates prior to the Closing. With respect  to the Casualty Insurance
Claims where coverage is available under the Insurance  Policies, the
following procedures shall apply: (i) CCE or its Affiliates shall  continue
to administer, adjust, settle and pay, on behalf of TPC, all Casualty 
Insurance Claims; provided, however, that CCE will obtain the consent of ETP 
prior to adjusting, settling or paying any Casualty Insurance Claim of an
amount  greater than $100,000 and provided further, that CCE shall permit ETP
to join  CCE in any settlement negotiations with claimants, insurers, or
insurance  adjusters and (ii) CCE shall invoice TPC at the end of each month
for Casualty  Insurance Claims paid on behalf of TPC. ETP shall cause TPC to
pay the invoice  within thirty (30) days of its date. In the event that TPC
does not pay CCE  within thirty (30) days of such invoice, interest at the
rate of ten percent  (10%) per annum shall accrue on the amount of such
invoice. Casualty Insurance  Claims to be paid by CCE hereunder shall include
all costs necessary to settle  claims including compensatory, medical, legal
and other allocated expenses,  net  of insurance proceeds. In the event that
any Casualty Insurance Claims exceeds  a  deductible or self-insured
retention under the Insurance Policies, CCE shall  be  entitled to the
benefit of any insurance proceeds that may be available to  discharge any
portion of such Casualty Insurance Claim.

 

 

(b) After  the  Closing, ETP shall be responsible for, and neither CCE nor
any of its Affiliates  shall have any responsibility for, the payment of any
deductible amounts or  underlying limits attributable to the Insurance
Policies for Casualty Insurance  Claims relating to TPC. ETP acknowledges
that certain of the Insurance Policies  may require CCE or any of its
Affiliates to provide an indemnity to the  insurance carrier for deductible
amounts and to provide collateral to secure  such indemnity obligations. ETP
hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless  CCE  or any of its Affiliates
(as applicable) for any and all of the costs of  maintaining such collateral
and for any charges made against such collateral  or  indemnification
payments in connection with claims arising or alleged to arise  from the
operations of TPC required to be paid

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 


 

by  CCE of  any of its Affiliates (as applicable) under or with respect to
such Insurance  Policies from and after the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) Other  than as set forth in Section 3.21 hereof, CCE makes no
representation or  warranty with respect to the applicability, validity or
adequacy of any  Insurance Policies, and CCE shall not be responsible to ETP
or any of its  Affiliates for the failure of any insurer to pay under any
such Insurance  Policy.

 

 

(d) Nothing  in this Agreement is intended to provide or shall be construed
as providing  a  benefit or release to any insurer or claims service
organization of any  obligation under any Insurance Policies. CCE and ETP
confirm that the sole  intention of this Section 5.8 is to divide and
allocate the benefits and  obligations under the Insurance Policies between
them as of the Closing Date  and  not to affect, enhance or diminish the
rights and obligations of any insurer  or  claims service organization
thereunder. Nothing herein shall be construed as  creating or permitting any
insurer or claims service organization the right  of  subrogation against
CCE or ETP or any of their Affiliates in respect of payments  made by one to
the other under any Insurance Policy.

 

 

(e) If  ETP  requests a copy of an Insurance Policy relating to a pending or
threatened  Casualty Insurance Claim, CCE shall provide a copy of all
relevant insurance  policies which insure such Casualty Insurance Claims
within five (5) Business  Days, provided, however, that if CCE cannot provide
such policy within five  (5)  Business Days after exercising commercially
reasonable efforts to locate such  policy, CCE shall continue to exercise its
commercially reasonable efforts  to  provide such policy to ETP as soon as
possible thereafter.

 

 

(f) Except  to  the extent specified in this Section 5.8, TPC shall not
participate in any  insurance policy or program of CCE or any of its
Affiliates following the  Closing.

 

 

Section  5.9 _Preservation  of Records_.  ETP  agrees that it shall, at
its own expense, preserve and keep the records held  by  it relating to the
business of TPC that could reasonably be required after  the  Closing by CCE
for as long as may be required for such categories of records  by  the time
periods required by Applicable Law and in accordance with CCE's  document
retention practices. In addition, ETP shall make such records available  to
CCE as may reasonably be required by CCE in connection with, among other 
things, any insurance claim, legal proceeding or governmental investigation 
relating to the respective businesses of CCE and its Affiliates, including 
TPC.

 

 

Section  5.10 _Public  Statements_. Neither party shall, nor shall permit
its Affiliates to, issue  or cause the publication of any press release or
other announcement with respect  to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the consent  of  the other party hereto, unless
such disclosure is required by Applicable Law,  or  by obligations pursuant
to any agreement with any national securities exchange;  _provided, 
however_ ,  that  the party intending to make such release shall give the
other parties prior  notice and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
consistent with such  Applicable Law or obligation to consult with the other
parties with respect  to  the text thereof.

assigned to TPC, the  trademarks, service marks, and trade names listed on

logotypes, designs and trade  dress  associated therewith, including all
applications and registrations therefor,  which are, in each case, in
existence on the Closing Date and currently being  used in the conduct of the
business of TPC (collectively, the " **TPC  Marks** "). 

 

 

(b) CCE  shall  use commercially reasonable efforts to assist ETP in
protecting and maintaining  the rights of TPC in connection with use of the
TPC Marks by TPC, including  preparation and execution of documents necessary
or appropriate in the ordinary  course to register TPC Marks and/or record
this Agreement. As between the  parties, ETP shall have the sole right to,
and in its sole discretion may,  commence, prosecute or defend, and control
any action concerning the TPC Marks. 

 

 

Section  5.12 _Commercially  Reasonable Efforts_.  Upon  the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties  hereto will
use, and will cause their respective Affiliates to use, all  commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action,  and  to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable consistent 
with Applicable Law to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious 
manner practicable the transactions contemplated hereby.

comply in all material  respects with the requirements of Regulation S-X, as

the Closing as are contained in such documents as  of  the date of execution
of this Agreement, and ETP shall cause TPC to honor all  such provisions,
including making any indemnification payments and expense  advancements
thereunder. In the event that any indemnifiable claim is asserted  or made
within such six (6) year period, all rights to indemnification and 
advancement of expenses in respect of such claim shall continue to the
extent  currently permitted under TPC's certificate of formation and limited
liability  company agreement or other organizational documents until such
claim is disposed  of or all orders in connection with such claim are fully
satisfied. CCE agrees  to submit any such claims for indemnification for acts
or omissions that  occurred at or prior to the Closing by any such person to
any of its applicable  directors' and officers' insurance policy covering the
matters that give rise to  any such claim and CCE shall use reasonable

(c) by  either  ETP or CCE upon written notice to the other party, if any of
the mutual  conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 6.1 shall have

case may be, and  shall not have been waived in writing by the other party;

 

 

(d) by  ETP,  so long as ETP is not then in breach of its obligations under
this Agreement,  upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of
CCE set forth in  this  Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of
CCE shall have been or become  untrue, in each case such that the conditions
set forth in Section 6.2 would  not  be satisfied; _provided,  however_ , 
that  ETP may not terminate this Agreement if such breach or untruth is
capable of  being cured by CCE by not later than February 1, 2007 or March 1,
2007, as  the  case may be, through the exercise of its commercially
reasonable efforts, so  long as CCE continues to exercise such commercially
reasonable efforts (until  February 1, 2007 or March 1, 2007, as the case may
be);

 

 

(e) by  CCE,  so long as CCE is not then in breach of its obligations under

ruling or other action is not  subject to appeal; unless failure to
consummate closing because of such action  by the Governmental Authority is
due to the failure of the party seeking to  terminate to have fulfilled its
obligations under Section 5.3 and Section  5.4.

 

 

The  right  of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this  Section 7.1 shall remain operative and in full force and effect

hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement contained herein,  such

liability, product liability  or other cause of action or theory of liability
(except, in all cases Claims  alleging fraud, intentional misrepresentation
or intentional misconduct), may  be  brought unless suit thereon is filed,
or a written notice describing the nature  of that Claim, the theory of
liability, the nature of the relief sought and  the  material factual
assertions upon which the Claim is based is given to the other  party, before
the termination of the Survival Period.

 

 

(c) The  survival period of each representation or warranty as provided in
this Section  8.1 is referred to herein as the " **Survival  Period**." 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any representation or warranty that would 
otherwise terminate shall survive with respect to Damages which respect to 
which  suit thereon is filed or of which notice describing the nature of
that 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Claim,  the theory of liability, the nature of the relief sought and the
material  factual assertions upon which the Claim is based is given pursuant
to this  Agreement prior to the end of the Survival Period, until the matter
is finally  resolved and any related Damages are paid.

 

 

Section  8.2 _Indemnification_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, subsequent to
the Closing,  CCE shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless, ETP, TPC,
their respective  successors and permitted assigns, and their shareholders,
members, partners  (general and limited), officers, directors, managers,
trustees, incorporators,  employees, agents, attorneys, consultants and
representatives, and each of  their  heirs, executors, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " **ETP  Indemnified Parties** "),  against and
in respect of any and all Damages to the extent incurred by the  ETP 
Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection 
with:

 

 

(i) any  breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of CCE
contained in  this  Agreement;

 

 

(ii) any  breach by CCE of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement;  and

 

 

(iii) any  Third  Party Claim against ETP arising out of or resulting from
ETP's indirect  ownership interests in CrossCountry Citrus, LLC, Citrus Corp.
or any  Subsidiaries of Citrus Corp. other than for actions authorized, or
intentional  acts of omission, by ETP in its capacity as the Class B Member
or by any Class  B  Executive Committee Member under, and as defined in, the
CCE LLC Agreement. 

 

 

(b) Subject  to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, subsequent to
the Closing,  ETP shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless, CCE and
its Affiliates,  their respective successors and permitted assigns, and their
shareholders,  members, partners (general and limited), officers, directors,
managers,  trustees, incorporators, employees, agents, attorneys, consultants
and  representatives, and each of their heirs, executors, successors and
assigns  (collectively, the " **CCE  Indemnified Parties** ")  against and
in respect of any and all Damages to the extent incurred by the  CCE 
Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection 
with:

 

 

(i) any  breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of ETP
contained in  this  Agreement;

 

 

(ii) any  breach by ETP of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement;  and

 

 

(iii) any  liability or obligation of TPC, whether arising before or after
Closing, to  the  extent such liability or obligation (x) cannot be properly
asserted against  CCE  under Section 8.2(a) or otherwise by ETP, except to
the extent such liability  or  obligation cannot be properly asserted
against CCE because of limitations under  Section 8.2(d), and (y) do not
arise as a result of any other obligation of  CCE  to any ETP Indemnified
Party arising under this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(c) Any  Person providing indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
Section  8.2  is referred to herein as an " **Indemnifying  Party**
," and  any Person entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the provisions of
this Section  8.2 is referred to herein as an " **Indemnified  Party**."

 

 

(d) CCE's  indemnification obligations contained in Section 8.2(a)(i) shall
not apply  to  any Claim for Damages until the aggregate of all such Damages
total $15,000,000  (the " **Threshold  Amount** "),  in  which event CCE's
indemnity obligation contained in Section 8.2(a)(i) shall  apply to all
Claims for Damages in excess of the Threshold Amount, subject  to a  maximum
liability to all Indemnified Parties, in the aggregate, of $75,000,000  (the
" **Cap  Amount** ")  for  all Claims under Section 8.2(a)(i) in the
aggregate; provided, however, that  the  limitations set forth in this
sentence shall not apply with respect to CCE's  indemnification obligations
related to breaches of the representations and  warranties contained in
Section 3.2 (Authority Relative to this Agreement)  or  Section 3.3 (TPC
Interests); and provided further that, notwithstanding anything  in this
Agreement to the contrary, claims for indemnification relating to the 
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.12(g) will not be
subject  to the Threshold Amount or the Cap Amount and shall be independently
determined  without regard to such limitations. Damages relating to any
single breach or  series of related breaches of CCE's representations and
warranties shall not  constitute Damages, and therefore shall not be applied
towards the Threshold  Amount or be indemnifiable hereunder, unless such
Damages relating to any single  breach or series of related breaches exceed
$300,000 (the " **Minimum  Claim Amount** ").

 

 

(e) ETP's  indemnification obligations contained in Section 8.2(b)(i) shall
not apply  to  any Claim for Damages until the aggregate of all such Damages
equals the  Threshold Amount, in which event ETP's indemnification obligation
contained in  Section 8.2(b)(i) shall apply to all Claims for Damages in
excess of the  Threshold Amount, subject to a maximum liability to all
Indemnified Parties,  in  the aggregate, of the Cap Amount for all Claims
under Section 8.2(b)(i) in  the  aggregate; _provided,  however_ ,  that 
the limitations set forth in this sentence shall not apply with respect to 
ETP's  indemnification obligations related to breaches of the representations
and  warranties contained in Section 4.2 (Authority Relative to this
Agreement)  or  Section 4.3 (50% CCE Interests). Damages relating to any
single breach or series  of related breaches of ETP's representations and
warranties shall not constitute  Damages, and therefore shall not be applied
towards the Threshold Amount or  be  indemnifiable hereunder, unless such
Damages relating to any single breach  or  series of related breaches
exceeds the Minimum Claim Amount.

 

 

(f) The  indemnification obligations of each party hereto under this Section
8.2 shall  inure to the benefit of the ETP Indemnified Parties and CCE
Indemnified Parties,  and such ETP Indemnified Parties and CCE Indemnified
Parties will be obligated  to keep and perform the obligations imposed on an
Indemnified Party by this  Section 8.2, on the same terms as are applicable
to such other  party.

 

 

(g) In  all  cases in which a Person is entitled to be indemnified in
accordance with this  Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall be under a duty
to take all commercially  reasonable measures to mitigate all losses. Without
limiting the foregoing,  each  Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to collect  any  amount available under

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 


 

insurance  coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible, for
any Damages  for which an indemnity claim is being made; _provided, 
however_ ,  that  the reasonable costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in
taking such measures  shall be included in the amount of any Claim.

 

 

(h) An  Indemnified Party shall not be entitled under this Agreement to
multiple  recovery for the same losses. If an Indemnified Party receives any
amount under  applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged
to be  responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment
by the  Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the  Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by
such Indemnifying  Party in connection with providing such indemnification
payment up to the amount  received by the Indemnified Party, net of any
expenses incurred by such  Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

 

 

(i) All  amounts paid by CCE or ETP, as the case may be, under this Article
VIII shall  be  treated as adjustments to the property distributed by CCE to
ETP in redemption  of the 50% CCE Interest for all Tax purposes.

 

 

(j) Notwithstanding  any other provision in the Agreement to the contrary,
this Section 8.2 shall  not  apply to any Claim of indemnification with
respect to Tax matters. Claims for  indemnification with respect to Tax
matters shall be governed by Section 5.6. 

 

 

(k) For  purposes of this Article VIII only, the existence of a breach of a 
representation or warranty in this Agreement and the calculation of Damages 
arising out of a breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement 
shall be determined without giving effect to any exception or qualification 
of  such representation or warranty as to the materiality of the breach
thereof  or  the Material Adverse Effect on any Person of such breach.

 

 

Except  as  provided in Section 5.6 hereof, the provisions of this Article
VIII shall  constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party
for Damages  arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection with
any inaccuracy  in  any representation or the breach of any warranty made by
ETP, on the one hand,  or CCE, on the other hand, in this Agreement;
_provided,  however_ ,  that  this exclusive remedy for Damages does not
preclude a party from bringing an  Action for specific performance or other
equitable remedy to require a party  to  perform its obligations under this
Agreement; provided further, that this  exclusive remedy for Damages does not
preclude a party from bringing an Action  alleging fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or intentional misconduct without  reference to the
provisions of this Article VIII.

 

 

Section  8.3 _Calculation  of Damages_.  The  Damages suffered by any
Indemnified Party shall be calculated after giving  effect to the actual
receipt of any available insurance proceeds paid directly  to the Indemnified
Party. In computing the amount of any insurance proceeds,  such insurance
proceeds shall be reduced by a reasonable estimate of the present  value of
future premium increases attributable to the payment of such  Claim.

 

 

Section  8.4 _Procedures  for Third-Party Claims_.

 

 

(a) In  the  case of any Claim for indemnification arising from a Claim of a
third party  against an Indemnified Party arising under paragraph 8.2(a) or
8.2(b) as the  case may

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 


 

be  (a " **Third-Party  Claim** "),  an  Indemnified Party shall give
prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party  of  any Claim or demand of
which such Indemnified Party has knowledge, and as to  which it may request
indemnification hereunder, specifying (to the extent known)  the amount of
such Claim and any relevant facts and circumstances relating  thereto;
_provided,  however_ ,  that  any failure to give such prompt notice or to
provide any such facts and  circumstances will not waive any rights of the
Indemnified Party, except to  the  extent that the rights of the
Indemnifying Party are actually materially  prejudiced thereby. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right (and, if it  elects to exercise such
right, to do so by written notice within thirty (30)  days after receiving
notice from the Indemnified Party) to defend and to direct  the defense
against any such Third-Party Claim, in its name or in the name  of  the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, at the expense of the Indemnifying 
Party, and with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably 
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall  not have taken any action to defend such Third-Party Claim within such
thirty  (30) day period, or (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded  that there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party
and the  Indemnifying Party in the conduct of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (other
than the  last  sentence of this Section 8.4(a)), the Indemnified Party, at
the expense of  the  Indemnifying Party (which shall include only reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses  actually incurred), shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and keep the  Indemnifying Party fully informed in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim.  The  Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense of any  Third-Party Claim with counsel
employed at its own expense; _provided,  however_ ,  that in  the case of
any Third-Party Claim (A) described in clause (ii) above, or (B)  as  to
which the Indemnifying Party shall not in fact have employed counsel to 
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim within such thirty-day (30-day) 
period, or (C) that involves assertion of criminal liability on the
Indemnified  Party, or (D) seeks to force the Indemnified Party to take (or
prevent the  Indemnified Party from taking) any action, then in each such
case the  Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
conduct  and  control the defense thereof for the account of, and at the
risk of, the  Indemnifying Party, and the reasonable fees and disbursements
of such  Indemnified Party's counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party.  Except as provided in the last sentence of Section
8.4(b), the Indemnifying  Party shall have no indemnification obligations
with respect to any Third-Party  Claim which shall be settled by the
Indemnified Party without the prior written  consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 

 

(b) The  Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any Third Party
Claim  as  provided in this Agreement, shall not consent to a settlement of,
or the entry  of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party Claim
without the Indemnified  Party's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld,  delayed or conditioned) unless (i) such
settlement or judgment relates solely  to  monetary damages, and (ii) prior
to consenting to such settlement or such entry  of judgment, the Indemnifying
Party delivers to the Indemnified Party a writing  (in form reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party) which unconditionally  provides that,
subject to the provisions of Section 8.2(d) or Section 8.2(e),  as 
appropriate, relating to the Minimum Claim Amount, the Threshold Amount and 
the  Cap Amount, the Damages represented thereby are the responsibility of
the  Indemnifying Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and that,
subject  to  the provisions of the Threshold Amount, the Indemnifying Party
shall pay all  Damages associated therewith in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.  The  Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified
Party's prior written 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 


 

consent,  enter into any compromise or settlement that (x) commits the
Indemnified Party  to take, or to forbear to take, any action or (y) involves
a reasonable  likelihood of an imposition of criminal liability on the
Indemnified Party,  or  (z) does not provide for a complete release by such
third party of the  Indemnified Party. With the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which  consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, the  Indemnified Party shall have the sole and
exclusive right to settle any  Third-Party Claim, on such terms and
conditions as it deems reasonably  appropriate, to the extent such Third-
Party Claim involves equitable or other  nonmonetary relief against the
Indemnified Party or involves a reasonable  likelihood of an imposition of
criminal liability on the Indemnified Party,  and  shall have the right to
settle any Third-Party Claim involving money damages  for  which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense pursuant to this  Section 8.4.

 

 

Section  8.5 _Procedures  for Inter-Party Claims_.  In the  event that an
Indemnified Party determines that it has a Claim for Damages  against an
Indemnifying Party hereunder (other than as a result of a Third-Party 
Claim), the Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice thereof to
the  Indemnifying Party, specifying the amount of such Claim and any relevant
facts  and circumstances relating thereto, and such notice shall be promptly
given  even  if the nature or extent of the Damages is not then known. The
notification  shall  be subsequently supplemented within a reasonable time
as additional information  regarding the Claim or the nature or extent of
Damages resulting therefrom  becomes available to the Indemnified Party. Any
failure to give such prompt  notice or supplement thereto or to provide any
such facts and circumstances  will  not waive any rights of the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent that the  rights of the Indemnifying Party are
actually materially prejudiced thereby.  The  Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in good faith  for a  thirty-day (30-day)
period regarding the resolution of any disputed Claims  for  Damages.
Promptly following the final determination of the amount of any Damages 
claimed by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party, subject to the 
limitations of the Minimum Claim Amount, Threshold Amount and the Cap
Amount,  shall pay such Damages to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer or
check made  payable to the order of the Indemnified Party.
