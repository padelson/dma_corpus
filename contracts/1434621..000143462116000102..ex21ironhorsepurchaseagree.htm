(b) During the thirty (30) day period following Buyer's delivery of the

shall provide the Member Representative and its Representatives reasonable
access to the relevant books and records and employees of the Company for the
purpose of facilitating the Member Representative's review of the Closing
Statement. The Closing Statement shall become final and binding at the end of
the last day of the Review Period, unless prior to the end of the Review
Period, the Member Representative delivers to Buyer a written notice of
disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") specifying the nature and amount of
any and all items in dispute as to the amounts set forth in the Closing
Statement. The Member Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all
items and amounts in the Closing Statement not specifically referenced in a
Notice of Disagreement provided prior to the end of the Review Period.

(c) During the fifteen (15)-day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Member Representative to Buyer (the "Resolution Period"),
such parties in good faith shall seek to resolve in writing any differences
that they may have with respect to the computation of the amounts as specified
therein. Any disputed items resolved in writing between the Member
Representative and Buyer within the Resolution Period shall be final and
binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If the Member
Representative and Buyer have not resolved all such differences by the end of
the Resolution Period, the Member Representative and Buyer shall submit, in
writing, such differences to the Accounting Expert. The "Accounting Expert"
shall be a Neutral Accounting Firm selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and
the Member Representative; provided, however, that: (i) if, within fifteen
(15) days after the end of the Resolution Period, such parties are unable to
agree on a Neutral Accounting Firm to act as the Accounting Expert, then each
party shall select a Neutral Accounting Firm and such firms together shall
select the Neutral Accounting Firm to act as the Accounting Expert, and (ii)
if any party does not select a Neutral Accounting Firm within ten (10) days of
written demand therefor by the other party, then the Neutral Accounting Firm
selected by the other party shall act as the Accounting Expert. A "Neutral
Accounting Firm" means an independent accounting firm of nationally recognized
standing that is not at the time it is to be engaged hereunder rendering
services to any party, or any Affiliate of either, and has not done so within
the two (2) year-period prior thereto.

(d) The parties shall arrange for the Accounting Expert to agree in its
engagement letter to act in accordance with this Section 2.3(d). Each party
shall present a brief to the Accounting Expert (which brief shall also be
concurrently provided to the other party) within ten (10) days of the
appointment of the Accounting Expert detailing such party's views as to the
correct nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute from the Notice of
Disagreement (and for the avoidance of doubt, no party may introduce a dispute
to the Accounting Expert that was not originally set forth on the Notice of
Disagreement). Within ten (10) days of receipt of the brief, the receiving
party



may present a responsive brief to the Accounting Expert (which responsive
brief shall also be concurrently provided to the other party). Each party may
make an oral presentation to the Accounting Expert (in which case, such
presenting party shall notify the other party of such presentation, and the
other party shall have the right to be present (but not speak) at such
presentation), within twenty (20) days of the appointment of the Accounting
Expert. The Accounting Expert shall have the opportunity to present written
questions to either party, a copy of which shall be provided to the other
party. The Accounting Expert shall consider only those items and amounts in
the Member Representative's and Buyer's respective calculations that are
identified as being items and amounts to which the Member Representative and
Buyer have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Expert shall select either the position of Buyer or Member
Representative as a resolution for each item or amount disputed and may not
impose an alternative resolution with respect to any item or amount disputed.
The Accounting Expert shall make a written determination within forty-five
(45) days of its appointment as to each such disputed item, which
determination shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder absent manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Expert and of any enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by
the Members (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share), on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail
on the matters resolved by the Accounting Expert, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative
dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the
Accounting Expert at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on
the merits of the matters submitted.

Section 2.4. Payment.

(a) The "Net Adjustment Amount" shall equal zero (0):

(i) minus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Company Transaction
Expenses exceed the Estimated Closing Company Transaction Expenses;

(ii) plus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Company
Transaction Expenses exceed the Closing Company Transaction Expenses;

(iii) minus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Funded Indebtedness
exceeds the Estimated Closing Funded Indebtedness;

(iv) plus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Funded

(b) Within thirty (30) days following delivery by Buyer of an Earnout
Statement, the Member Representative shall deliver written notice to Buyer of

for its disagreement. During such period, Buyer shall provide the Member
Representative and its Representatives reasonable access to the relevant books

Member Representative's review of the applicable Earnout Statement. In the
event that the Member Representative does not notify Buyer in writing of a
disagreement with respect to the Earnout Statement within such thirty (30)-day
period, such Earnout Statement shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding
on the parties. If the Member Representative delivers a notice of disagreement
within such thirty (30)-day period, then Buyer and the Member Representative
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement. If Buyer and
the Member Representative, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to

(i) the First Earnout Period exceeds:

(A) $14,699,999.99, in the event that the Injunction does not materially
restrict the operation of the Company during any portion of the First Earnout
Period,



then Buyer will pay (in accordance with Section 2.5(e)) to Jeffrey Meyer and
the Members their Pro Rata Share of $11,250,000 plus Buyer will pay (in
accordance with Section 2.5(e)) to Jeffrey Meyer and the Members their Pro
Rata Share of $1.7857143 for every dollar of EBITDA for such period above
$14,699,999.99 and up to and including $21,000,000;

(B) $13,349,999.99, in the event that the Injunction materially restricts the
operations of the Company during the First Earnout Period for a period of six
(6) months or less, then Buyer will pay (in accordance with Section 2.5(e)) to
Jeffrey Meyer and the Members their Pro Rata Share of $9,687,500 plus Buyer
will pay (in accordance with Section 2.5(e)) to Jeffrey Meyer and the Members
their Pro Rata Share of $1.94128788 for every dollar of EBITDA for such period

For purposes of clarity, in no event shall the amount payable to Jeffrey Meyer
and the Members pursuant to this clause (i) exceed $22,500,000; and

(ii) the Second Earnout Period exceeds:

(A) $17,499,999.99, in the event that the Injunction does not materially
restrict the operations of the Company during any portion of the Second
Earnout Period, then Buyer will pay (in accordance with Section 2.5(e)) to
Jeffrey Meyer and the Members their Pro Rata Share of $11,250,000 plus Buyer
will pay (in accordance with Section 2.5(e)) to Jeffrey Meyer and the Members
their Pro Rata Share of $1.50 for every dollar of EBITDA for such period above
$17,499,999.99 and up to and including $25,000,000

(B) $15,624,999.99, in the event that the Injunction materially restricts the

(6) months or less, then Buyer will pay (in accordance with Section 2.5(e)) to
Jeffrey Meyer and the Members their Pro Rata Share of $9,687,500 plus Buyer

their Pro Rata Share of $1.57692307 for every dollar of EBITDA for such period

(d) In the event that: (i) the Members do not achieve the maximum amount
payable pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(i) and (ii) EBITDA for the Second Earnout
Period, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.5(b), exceeds $25,000,000,
then the payment pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(i) shall be recalculated using the
EBITDA for the First Earnout Period, as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.5(b), plus the amount of such excess. In the event that such payment as
recalculated exceeds the amount previously paid to the Members pursuant to
Section 2.5(c)(i), then Buyer will pay (in accordance with Section 2.5(e)) to
Jeffrey Meyer and the Members their Pro Rata Share of the amount that such
recalculated payment exceeds the payment that was actually made. Such payment
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts
designated in writing by the Member Representative concurrently with the
payment payable pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(ii).

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the Meyer Employment Agreement,
and following the deduction of any other Company Transaction Expenses, Jeffrey

and set off any amounts owed by the Members to Buyer under the terms of this

subject to the terms of Section 7.9 with respect to indemnity payments.

(f) During the Earnout Period:

(i)Buyer shall operate the business of the Company in good faith and in a

conditions;

(ii)Buyer shall authorize spending by the Company consistent with the business
plan and budget attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Business Plan and Budget");

(iii)Buyer shall appoint Mettler to act as senior executive of the Company
having general authority to make decisions consistent with the Business Plan

overseeing revenues and expenses of the Company, the Board of Directors of
LendingTree, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent") and terms of his
applicable Executive Offer Letter;



(iv)Buyer shall operate the Company as a separate profit center, business unit

Except as set forth in this Section 2.5(f), Buyer has no obligation to operate
its, the Company's or the respective Affiliate's businesses to achieve any
Earnout or to maximize the amount of the Earnout. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer may from time to time consult and work with Company senior
management on key areas of operations and facilitate the use of features of
the acquired business by other units and divisions of Buyer and other products
and services offered by Buyer, with the parties acknowledging that assets,
personnel and technology of the Company may be leveraged by Buyer from time to
time. To the extent such consulting or use of assets alters the covenants set
forth above and such alteration materially reduces the revenue or materially
increases the expenses credited for EBITDA, then Buyer and the Member
Representative shall negotiate in good faith with respect to equitable
adjustments to the thresholds set forth in Section 2.5(c).

Knowledge, duly and validly subsisting. The Company owns all right, title and
interest, in and to the Company Intellectual Property, free and clear of Liens
other than Permitted Liens and licenses in the ordinary course of business and

licenses for off-the-shelf software (in each case with a license fee not

"Licensed Intellectual Property"; such licenses, sublicenses, agreements or
permissions, together with all amendments, modifications and supplements
thereto, "IP Licenses"). The Company has delivered to Buyer true and complete
copies of such IP Licenses. The Company is not in material breach of or in
material default (whether with or without the giving of notice, passage of
time or both) under any IP Licenses or in respect of any Licensed Intellectual
Property, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no counterparty to any IP
License is in material breach or material default (whether with or without the
giving of notice, passage of time or both) under or in respect of any such IP
License or Licensed Intellectual Property. The Company does not license
Intellectual Property to any other Person.

(c) During the past three (3) years, no written claim has been brought or made
against the Company: (i) alleging that their use of any Intellectual Property

violates the rights of, another Person, including any requirement that they
take a license under or pay any consideration in respect of any Intellectual
Property of another Person; (ii) challenging the ownership, right to use or
validity of the Company Intellectual Property or the right to use or validity
of any Licensed Intellectual Property; or (iii) opposing or attempting to
cancel the Company's rights in any Intellectual Property. No Action is

the Company with respect to any Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no Person is infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating
the rights of the Company in the Company Intellectual Property or other
Intellectual Property owned by the Company.

(d) No current or former employee or contractor of the Company has any right
to payment with respect to the Company's use of any Intellectual Property.
Each current or former employee or contractor of the Company that has
contributed to the conception or development of any Intellectual Property used
by the Company has executed an agreement assigning all rights in such
Intellectual Property to the Company, which agrees is valid and binding
against the Company and, to the Company's Knowledge, the other party thereto,
and has irrevocably waived in writing any non-assignable rights (including
moral rights) that such Person may possess with respect to such Intellectual
Property.

(e) The Company has taken commercially reasonable measures to protect the
confidentiality of their Intellectual Property and other proprietary
information, the value of which is contingent upon maintaining the
confidentiality thereof, and of third party confidential information provided
to the Company under an obligation of confidentiality.

software and is in compliance in all material respects with the requirements
thereof, and such licenses will remain in full force and effect in accordance

delivery or performance by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement or

Buyer of this Agreement and each of the Buyer Transaction Documents, and the

under, any Contract to which Buyer is a party or result in the creation of any

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Buyer is not subject to any
order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree of any Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator or arbitrators that,

relying exclusively on the representations set forth in Articles 3 and 4 and
its own examination and investigation of the Company and that it is not
relying on any other statements or documents.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that:
(i) neither the Company nor any Member makes any representation or warranty
with respect to (A) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made
available to Buyer of future revenues, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) of the Company or the Business or the future business and
operations of the Company or the Business or (B) any other information or

has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay their
respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all
contingent liabilities). Immediately after giving effect to the Closing (and
any transactions related thereto or incurred in connection therewith), Buyer
shall have adequate capital to carry on its business.

ARTICLE 6

COVENANTS



Section 6.1. Public Disclosure; Confidentiality.

(a) Any public announcement, press release or similar publicity with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will be issued, if
at all, at such time and in such manner as Buyer determines; provided, that
the content of such announcements shall be subject to the prior approval of
the Member Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably



delayed, withheld or postponed; provided, further, that if the Member
Representative fails to timely respond to Buyer\'s request for such approval,
then Buyer may proceed with issuing any such announcement, press release or
similar publicity to the extent Buyer in good faith believes that such
issuance is required by applicable Law. Except with the prior written consent
of Buyer or the Member Representative, as applicable, or as permitted by this
Agreement, none of the parties hereto or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall disclose to any Person: (i) the fact that any
confidential information of the Company has been disclosed to Buyer or its
Representatives, that any confidential information of Buyer has been disclosed
to the Members or the Member Representative or (ii) any information about the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the status of such discussions or
negotiations, the execution of any documents (including this Agreement) or any
of the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby or the related documents
(including this Agreement).

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Mutual Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated February 4, 2014, between the Company and the Company is
hereby terminated and shall be of no further force or effect.

Section 6.2. Non-Competition. Mettler agrees as follows:

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-Competition Period"), Mettler
shall not, and shall cause each of his controlled Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) acquire, own, manage, operate, join, control, participate
in the ownership, management, operation or control of or engage in, consult
with or perform services for, lend money or capital to, invest capital in, or
be connected in any manner with, including, without limitation, as a partner
or through stock ownership in, any business or Person (other that the Company,
or Buyer, Parent or any Affiliate of Buyer or Parent) that engages anywhere in
the United States of America (the "Restricted Territory") in the Business or
(ii) become employed by or otherwise render personal services to any Person in
the Business; provided, however, that Mettler and his controlled Affiliates
shall not be prohibited from (A) owning up to five percent (5%) of the
outstanding stock of a corporation that is publicly traded on a national
securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market so long as such Member
or Affiliate, as applicable, has no active participation in connection with
the business of such corporation and (B) passive ownership of SnapCap, as such
business is conducted as of the date hereof.

(b) During the Non-Competition Period, Mettler shall not, and shall cause each
of his controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, offer
employment to or hire any individual that is an employee of the Company or
otherwise induce or attempt to induce (whether for their own account or for
the account of any other Person) any individual that is an employee of the
Company to leave the employ of the Company; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 6.2(b) shall prohibit any such party from: (i) using general
solicitations (including through search firms) not targeted at employees of
the Company, or employing any person who responds to such solicitation; (ii)
hiring, employing or discussing employment with any person who contacts such
party independently without any solicitations by such party, or (iii)
soliciting any person who has left the employment of the Company at least
twelve (12) months prior to such party soliciting such person.



(c) During the Non-Competition Period, Mettler shall not, and shall cause each
of his controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt
to induce any customer, supplier, licensee or other business relation of the
Company to cease doing business with the Company or in any way interfere with
the relationship between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business
relation and the Company.

(d) The obligations contained in this Section 6.2 shall be construed as a
series of separate covenants, one for each country, province, state, city or
other political subdivision of the Restricted Territory. If any of such
separate covenants (or any part thereof) is deemed invalid or unenforceable,
Buyer and the Members agree that such invalid or unenforceable covenant (or
such part) shall be eliminated from this Agreement to the extent necessary to
permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced.
If any of the provisions of this Section 6.2 are deemed to exceed the time,
geographic or scope limitations permitted by applicable Law, Buyer and the
Members agree that such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time,
geographic or scope limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable
Law.

Section 6.3. Release.

(a) Buyer agrees that, effective as of the Closing Date, the Company shall be
deemed to have released and discharged each Member (whether in such Person's
capacity as a shareholder, director, officer, employee or otherwise) from any
and all claims, demands and causes of action, whether known or unknown,
liquidated or contingent, relating to, arising out of or in any way connected
with the dealings of the Company and such Person from the beginning of time
through the Closing Date (collectively, the "Company Released Claims"), it
being understood, however, that such release shall not operate to release such
Person from any of the terms, conditions or other provisions or obligations
under this Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

(b) Each Member, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby releases and
discharges, effective as of the Closing Date, the Company from any and all
claims, demands and causes of action, whether known or unknown, liquidated or
contingent, which each Member and such Affiliate ever had, now has or may have
relating to, arising out of or in any way connected with the dealings of the
Company and such Member or Affiliate or any circumstance, agreement, action,
omission, event or matter occurring or existing between them, in each case,
prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the "Member Released Claims" and
together with the Company Released Claims, the "Released Claims"); provided,
however, that the Member Released Claims shall not include (i) any of the
terms, conditions or other provisions or obligations under this Agreement or
the Transaction Documents, (ii) rights to any accrued but unpaid compensation
owed by the Company to the Members as of the Closing to the extent included in
Closing Working Capital, (iii) rights to any accrued but unpaid business
expenses of the Members to the extent that such expenses are reimbursable
under the Company's existing company policies to the extent included in
Closing Working Capital, or (iv) rights under any benefit plan maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by the Company as of the Closing.

(c) Each party acknowledges that the Laws of many states provide substantially
the following: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR
DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE



TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE
MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

Each party acknowledges that such provisions are designed to protect a party
from waiving claims which it does not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless,
each party agrees that, effective as of the Closing Date, each party shall be
deemed to waive any such provision.

(d) Each party further agrees that no party shall, nor permit any Affiliate
thereof to: (i) institute a lawsuit or other legal proceeding based upon,
arising out of, or relating to any of the Released Claims, (ii) participate,
assist, or cooperate in any such proceeding or (iii) encourage, assist and/or
solicit any third party to institute any such proceeding.

Section 6.4. Access to Records after Closing. For a period of seven (7) years
after the Closing Date, each Member and its Representatives shall have
reasonable access to all of the books and records of the Company, to the
extent that such access may reasonably be required in connection with matters
relating to or affected by the operations of the Company prior to the Closing
Date, including the preparation of the Member's financial reports or Tax
Returns, any Tax audits, the defense or prosecution of Actions, and any other
reasonable need of the Member to consult such books and records. Such access
shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and
during normal business hours. If Buyer or the Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates, shall desire to dispose of any of such books or records
prior to the expiration of such seven (7)-year period, Buyer shall, prior to
such disposition, give the Members a reasonable opportunity to segregate and
remove such books and records as the Members may select.

Section 6.5. Tax Matters.

(a) Buyer and Members agree to treat the purchase and sale of the Membership
Interests in accordance with Rev. Rul. 99-6, Situation 2 as follows: (i) as to
Buyer, as the purchase by Buyer of "all of" the assets of the Company from
Members, and (ii) as to Members, as the sale by Members of the Membership
Interests. For purposes of Sections 743(b), 755 and 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, the Purchase Price shall be
allocated in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder among the assets of the Company (or groups of such
assets) for all purposes (including all Tax and financial accounting purposes)
in accordance with their respective fair market values and in that connection
Buyer and Members further agree that (x) as soon as reasonably practicable but
at all events within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Closing,
Buyer shall in good faith determine and prepare a draft of IRS Form 8594
setting forth the allocation of the Purchase Price, as determined under
relevant U.S. federal income tax principles among the assets of the Company,
and (y) the Member Representative shall review such Form 8594 and provide any
proposed revisions to Buyer within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof,
and Buyer and the Member Representative shall endeavor in good faith to
resolve any disputes with respect thereto. Except as Buyer and the Member
Representative may otherwise agree or as may be required otherwise pursuant to
a final determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or a
corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, the parties (A)
will, and will cause each of their respective Affiliates to, prepare and file
all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8308) in a manner consistent with the
immediately preceding sentence, and (B) will not, and will cause each of their
respective Affiliates



not to, take any position inconsistent with the immediately preceding
sentence, unless required by a applicable Law (including the resolution of a
Tax audit). In the event that the Purchase Price allocation reflected in
accordance with this Section 6.5(a) is disputed by any Governmental Authority,
the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other
parties in writing, and the parties agree to use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to defend the Purchase Price allocation in any audit or
similar Tax proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 6.5(a), in the event Buyer and the Member Representative fail to reach
an agreement regarding the preparation of the IRS Form 8594, then Buyer and
the Member Representative each shall make its own determination as to its
purchase price allocation, and Buyer and the Membership Representative shall
each file an IRS Form 8594 reflecting such determination.

(b) At the sole expense of the Members, the Member Representative shall cause
to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company
for taxable periods ending prior to or on the Closing Date which are to be
filed after the Closing Date, which includes for the avoidance of doubt the
final partnership Tax Return of the Company with respect to the period ending
on the Closing Date (the "Member Returns"). Each such Member Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the Company's past practice except as
otherwise required by Law, and in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement; and the Member Representative shall timely pay any Taxes reflected
as due and payable on all such Tax Returns to the extent that such Taxes are
not reflected as a liability in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, as
finally determined. The Member Representative shall deliver to Buyer, for
Buyer's review and comment, each such Member Return at least thirty (30) days
prior to its due date (or if such Member Return is due in fewer than forty-
five (45) days after the Closing Date, then as soon after the Closing Date as
is reasonably practicable). Buyer shall provide written comments on each such
Member Return within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such Member Return. The
Member Representative shall consider in good faith any written comments made
with respect to any Member Returns that are Pass-Through Tax Returns, but the
Member Representative is not obligated to accept or incorporate any such
written comments. Only with respect to Member Returns other than Pass-Through
Tax Returns, if Buyer notifies Member Representative of any disagreement with
such Member Return, then the parties shall attempt to resolve such
disagreement through good-faith negotiation and if, within the ensuing fifteen
(15) days, the parties are unable to resolve their disagreement, then they
shall submit such disagreement to the Accounting Expert for resolution in
accordance with the procedures of Section 2.3(d), mutatis mutandis. In no
event shall the provision of comments by Buyer prevent the Member
Representative from timely filing any such Member Return and, in the event
that the Accounting Expert has not yet resolved any such disagreement prior to
the deadline for filing such Member Return (including any extensions), Member
Representative shall be entitled to file such Member Return (with Buyer's
cooperation) as prepared by Member Representative.

(c) Buyer shall cause the Company, at the Company's sole expense, to cause to
be prepared and filed all Tax Returns, other than the Member Returns, for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (including a Straddle Period) which are to be filed by
the Company after the Closing Date (the "Buyer Returns"). Each such Buyer
Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Company's past
practice except as otherwise required by Law, and in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement; and the Company shall timely pay any Taxes
reflected as due and payable on all such Tax Returns and the Member
Representative shall timely pay any Pre-Closing Taxes



reflected as due and payable on all such Tax Returns to the extent that such
Pre-Closing Taxes are not reflected as a liability in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital, as finally determined.

(d) None of Buyer, the Company, or any Affiliate of Buyer (including, after
the Closing, the Company) shall amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or grant
an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period without the prior written consent of the Member Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e) Any credits or refunds of Pre-Closing Taxes (to the extent that such
credits or refunds are not reflected as an asset in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital, as finally determined) shall belong to the Members and be
paid to the Member Representative upon actual receipt of such refund in cash
or application of such credit actually to reduce other Taxes due and owing by
Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates. If requested by the Member
Representative, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, reasonably
cooperate with the Member Representative in filing any Tax Return necessary to
claim such Tax refunds (including filing amended Tax Returns) by providing
relevant information. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice
of the Company. Any contrary provision of this Section 6.5(e) notwithstanding,
the amount of any refund or credit which is required to be paid to the Member
Representative (i) shall be reduced by the amount of any Taxes on such refund
or credit and any out-of-pocket expenses that Buyer, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates incur (or will incur) with respect to such refund
or credit, and (ii) shall not include any refund or credit (which shall be for
the benefit of Buyer, the Company or their respective Affiliates) that (A)
results from the carryback of any net operating loss, capital loss or other
Tax attribute incurred in any Tax period (or portion of any Straddle Period)
beginning after the Closing Date or (B) is included in the computation of
Closing Working Capital.

(f) After the Closing Date, Buyer, the Company and the Member Representative,
respectively, shall inform the other party in writing of the commencement of
any claim, audit, investigation, examination, or other proceeding or self-
assessment relating in whole or in part to a Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Tax
Contest") for which Buyer may be entitled to indemnity from the Members under
this Agreement. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the exclusive right
to represent the interests of the Company in any and all Tax Contests;
provided, however, that, to the extent that any such Tax Contest could
reasonably be expected to result in a Tax indemnification liability of the
Members pursuant to this Agreement, (i) Buyer shall keep the Member
Representative reasonably informed and consult in good faith with the Member
Representative and its Tax advisors with respect to any issue relating to such
Tax Contest (and the Member Representative and its Tax counsel or Tax adviser,
at the Members' expense, will be permitted to attend meetings with taxing
authorities) and (ii) Buyer shall timely provide the Member Representative
with copies of all correspondence, notices and other written materials
received from any taxing authorities and shall otherwise keep the Member
Representative and its Tax advisors advised of significant developments in
such Tax Contest and of significant communications involving representatives
of the taxing authorities. Buyer shall not agree or consent to compromise or
settle any Tax Contest on a basis that would result in a Pre-Closing Tax
liability of the Company or liability of the Members for indemnification
unless the Member Representative consents to such settlement, compromise or



concession, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.5(f), the
Member Representative shall, at the Members' expense, control any claim,
audit, investigation, examination, or other proceeding or self-assessments
relating to a Pass-Through Tax Return of the Company, provided that Buyer
shall have the right to participate at its own expense in any such action and
the Member Representative shall not settle, compromise or resolve such action
without Buyer's prior written consent to the extent such settlement could
increase the Taxes of the Company, Buyer or any Affiliate in a taxable period
after the Closing Date. The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall control over
any contrary provisions of Section 7.6.

(g) The parties shall cooperate (and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate) fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
parties, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant
to this Section 6.5 and any Tax audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes and payments in respect thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other parties' request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Buyer and the Company shall retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority. Each of the
parties shall furnish the other parties with copies of all relevant
correspondence received from any Governmental Authority in connection with any
Tax audit or information request with respect to any Taxes for which any other
party may have an indemnification obligation under this Agreement. Buyer and
the Member Representative agree, upon request, to provide the other party with
all information that either party may be required to report pursuant to
Sections 6043 and 6043A of the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

(h) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement ("Transfer
Taxes") shall be borne 50% by the Members, on the one hand, and 50% by Buyer,
on the other hand, when due, and the Company will, at its own expense, file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Taxes. Each of Buyer, the Company, and the Members will cooperate with each
other to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any such Transfer Taxes.

Section 6.6. Further Assurances. Each of the parties shall execute and deliver
such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) for ninety (90) days following
the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate any
personal guarantee given by Mettler to Google Inc. in connection with the
Security Agreement dated April 21, 2013 between the Company and Google Inc.,
(b) the Member Representative shall terminate



all UCC financing statements filed against the Company by Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association and Servisfirst Bank within ninety (90) days of the
Closing and (c) Buyer shall cause the Company's payroll provider to distribute
the Profit-Sharing Plan Amount (less applicable withholding) to the respective
payees.

Section 6.7. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Exculpation. Buyer
agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the current or former directors
or officers (or persons holding similar positions) of the Company have the
right to indemnification by the Company (collectively, the "Covered Persons")
as provided in its Organizational Documents or in indemnity or indemnification
agreements set forth on Schedule 6.7 or as provided under Law shall survive
the transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, for a period of not
less than six (6) years from the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not
permit the Company to, amend, modify or terminate any Organizational Document
regarding or related to such indemnification matters in a manner that would be
materially adverse to the Covered Persons with respect to pre-Closing periods.

(b) If Buyer or its successors or assigns: (i) shall consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer shall assume all of the obligations of Buyer set forth in
this Section 6.7.

Section 6.8. Employee Matters. Each Employee who remains employed by the
Company immediately after the Closing (each, a "Continuing Employee") shall be
allowed to participate in the Benefit Plans made available to him or her
immediately prior to the Closing Date through December 31, 2016 and,
thereafter, the employee benefit arrangements maintained by Buyer for its
similarly situated employees (each, a "Buyer Employee Benefit Arrangement").
To the extent that a Buyer Employee Benefit Arrangement is made available to
any Continuing Employee on or following the Closing Date, such Continuing
Employee shall receive credit for all service for his or her period of service
with the Company and predecessors prior to the Closing under the Buyer
Employee Benefit Arrangements, including, but not limited to, eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit accrual where length of service is relevant
(excluding accruals under defined benefit plans); provided, however, that such
service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication
of coverage or benefits or if such service was not recognized by the Company
under an analogous Benefit Plan. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, take commercially reasonable steps to waive all limitations as
to pre-existing conditions exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements,
waiting periods and actively-at-work or similar requirements with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees
under any medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefit
plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing
Date.



(b) Buyer shall provide, or cause the Company to provide, each Continuing
Employee with an offer letter total salary levels substantially similar in the
aggregate as provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company immediately
prior to the Closing Date; provided, that Jeffrey Meyer's salary level shall
be set forth in his offer letter. Subject to any written agreements to the
contrary and the other requirements of this Section 6.8, nothing contained in
this Section 6.8, however, will prohibit the Company or Buyer from terminating
at will any such Continuing Employees for any reason or no reason following
the Closing.

(c) Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee
as of immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be credited to such
Continuing Employee following the Closing Date ("Carry Over Vacation");
provided, that any Carry Over Vacation that has not been used by December 31,
2016 shall be forfeited. All future vacation accruals shall be subject to the
terms of Buyer's vacation policies, taking into account the balance of any
Carry Over Vacation.

(d) The Continuing Employees are not third-party beneficiaries of the
provisions of this Section 6.8, and nothing herein expressed or implied will
give or be construed to give any Continuing Employee any legal or equitable
rights hereunder. Furthermore, nothing contained in this Section 6.8 shall
constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan maintained or sponsored
by the Company, Buyer or their respective Affiliates, including any Benefit
Plan or Buyer Employee Benefit Arrangement.

that (i) any covenant to be performed after the Closing shall survive until

Indemnified Person provides written notice of such breach or inaccuracy (which
notice shall describe the applicable breach or inaccuracy in reasonable

Section 7.4. Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) The Members shall have no liability pursuant to Section 7.2(a) with
respect to Losses except to the extent that the aggregate amount of such
Losses exceeds an amount equal to $400,000 (the "Basket"), and then only in
respect of such excess; provided, that this Section 7.4(a) shall not apply to
any breach of any representation and warranty based on fraud or intentional
misrepresentation (but not negligent misrepresentation).

(b) Buyer shall have no liability pursuant to Section 7.3(a) with respect to
Losses except to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds
the Basket, and then only in respect of such excess; provided, that this
Section 7.4(b) shall not apply to any breach of any representation and
warranty based on fraud or intentional misrepresentation (but not negligent
misrepresentation).

(c) The Members shall have no liability pursuant to Section 7.2(a) with
respect to Losses in excess of the Escrow Amount; provided, that this Section
7.4(c) shall not apply to any breach of any representation and warranty based
on fraud or intentional misrepresentation (but not negligent
misrepresentation).

(d) Buyer shall have no liability pursuant to Section 7.3(a) with respect to

receives.



(f) Buyer shall have no liability pursuant to Section 7.3 in excess of the
purchase price actually paid hereunder.

(g) No Member shall have any liability pursuant to Section 7.2 with respect to
a Loss to the extent such Loss relates to any item included on, or is a
liability reserved or accrued for (whether in whole or in part) in, the
Closing Statement or that is otherwise taken into account in the calculation
of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article 2.

Section 7.5. Other Limitations.

(a) For all purposes of this Article 7, Losses shall be net of any amounts
actually paid to an Indemnified Person under any insurance policy or Contract
in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification
hereunder, and each Indemnified Person shall use its reasonable commercial
efforts to recover all amounts payable from an insurer or other third party
under any such insurance policy or Contract prior to seeking indemnification
hereunder; provided, however, that the amount deemed to be paid under such
insurance policies shall be net of the deductible and resulting premium
increases for such policies.

(b) If the amount to be netted hereunder from any indemnification payment
required hereunder is determined after payment by an Indemnifying Person to an
Indemnified Person of any amount otherwise required to be paid as
indemnification pursuant hereto, the Indemnified Person shall repay, promptly
after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Person would not
have had to pay pursuant hereto had such determination been made at the time
of such payment.

(c) Notwithstanding the fact that any Indemnified Person may have the right to
assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of more than one
provision of this Agreement in respect of any fact, event, condition or
circumstance, no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover the amount of
any Loss suffered by such Indemnified Person more than once, regardless of
whether such Loss may be as a result of a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, obligation or covenant or otherwise. In addition,
any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability, or a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, as applicable.

(d) For the purpose of determining the amount of Losses resulting from the
breach of any representation or warranty (but not as the existence of such
breach), any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar
qualification with respect to materiality contained in or otherwise applicable
to such representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

(e) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder or otherwise to
reimbursement for Losses in connection with the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Losses upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable
hereunder or in connection herewith.



Section 7.6. Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures.

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which a party (in such
capacity, an "Indemnifying Person") may have liability to any Indemnified
Person hereunder, other than those relating to Taxes (which are the subject of
Section 6.5), is asserted against or sought to be collected from any
Indemnified Person by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified
Person shall promptly, but in no event more than ten (10) days following such
Indemnified Person's receipt of a Third-Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying
Person of such Third-Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of
damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable, any other remedy
sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto, a
reasonably detailed explanation of the events giving rise to such Third-Party
Claim and any other material details pertaining thereto (a "Claim Notice");
provided, however, that the failure to timely give a Claim Notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Person shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure or as provided in Section 7.1. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Person shall deliver to the Indemnifying Person, promptly
following the Indemnified Person's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Person relating
to the Third-Party Claim.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified Person
that it elects to defend the Indemnified Person against a Third-Party Claim
within thirty (30) days following the receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Person of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have the right to
defend the Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnifiable
hereunder by appropriate proceedings and shall have the power to direct and
control such defense at its expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Person shall not have the right to assume the conduct and control
of such defense if the Third-Party Claim which the Indemnifying Person seeks
to assume control (i) seeks monetary relief in excess of the purchase price
actually paid hereunder or any non-monetary relief (including an injunction or
other equitable relief) as the primary remedy, (ii) involves criminal
allegations, or (iii) involves a claim that, in the good faith and reasonable
judgment of the Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying Person failed or is
failing to reasonably prosecute or defend. Once the Indemnifying Person has
made such election, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate
in (but not control) any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its
choosing at such Indemnified Person's expense; provided, however, that such
applicable Indemnified Person will be entitled to participate in (but not
control) any such defense with separate counsel at its own expense (unless
based on the advice of counsel to the applicable Indemnified Person, a
material legal conflict exists between the applicable Indemnified Person and
the Indemnifying Person that would make such separate representation
necessary, in which case the Indemnifying Person will bear such expense,
subject to the limitations set forth herein). If the Indemnifying Person does
not (or is not permitted to) elect to conduct or control the defense of any
Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnifiable hereunder, the
applicable Indemnified Person may conduct and control the defense of such
Third-Party Claim; provided, that the Indemnified Person shall not settle,
offer to settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Person (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).



(c) If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any
Third-Party Claim; provided, that, if the Indemnifying Person assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim and is in good faith contesting such Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Person's consent is not required for any
settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Person may reasonably recommend and that by its terms (i)
obligates the Indemnifying Person to pay the full amount of Losses in
connection with such Third-Party Claim, (ii) does not require any payment or
other action by any Indemnified Person or the admission of any wrongdoing or
misconduct by any Indemnified Person and (iii) fully and irrevocably releases
all Indemnified Persons in connection with such Third-Party Claim and does not
impose any injunctive or other equitable relief against any Indemnified Person
or its Affiliate.

(d) The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall reasonably
cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party
Claim, including by providing reasonable access to each other's relevant books
and records, and appropriate personnel. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying Person's request and sole expense) the
provision to the Indemnifying Person of books and records and information that
are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and appropriate personnel
available on a mutually convenient basis during normal business hours to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to avoid production of confidential information
(consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among
employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to
be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product
privileges (which may include redacting or withholding information as
reasonably appropriate).

Section 7.7. Direct Claim Indemnification Procedures. Each Indemnified Person
shall assert any claim on account of any Losses which do not result from a
Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") by giving the Indemnifying Person written
notice thereof reasonably promptly (and, in any event, no later than thirty
(30) days following the Indemnified Person's discovery of the applicable
Losses reasonably likely to give rise to a claim under this Article 7). Such
notice by the Indemnified Person shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, include copies of all available material written evidence thereof and
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Losses that have
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Person; provided, however, that
the failure to timely give such notice shall not affect the rights of an
Indemnified Person hereunder: (a) unless such failure has a prejudicial effect
on the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying Person with
respect to such Direct Claim or on the Indemnifying Person's ability to
mitigate such Direct Claim, or (b) unless the indemnification obligations are
materially increased as a result of such failure.



Section 7.8. Investigation by Indemnifying Parties. In connection with any
claim pursuant to this Article 7:

(a) The Indemnified Persons shall allow the Indemnifying Person and its
financial, accounting or legal advisers to investigate the fact, matter or
circumstance alleged to (or which may) give rise to such claim and whether and
to what extent any amount is or may be payable in respect of such claim.

(b) The Indemnified Persons shall disclose to the Indemnifying Person all
material of which they are aware which relates to the claim and shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates and all of their respective Representatives to,
provide such information and assistance as the Indemnifying Person or its
financial, accounting or legal advisers shall reasonably request, including:

(i) access to premises and personnel (including any employee with knowledge
relating to the relevant facts, matters or circumstances or who can otherwise
reasonably assist the Indemnifying Person); and

(ii) the right to examine and copy or photograph any relevant assets,
accounts, correspondence, documents and records.

Section 7.9. Indemnification Payment Priority. Except with respect to claims
for fraud or intentional misrepresentation (but not negligent
misrepresentation), for any Loss for which the Members are obligated to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons, the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall
seek reimbursement for such Loss: (a) first, from the Escrow Amount, and once
the Escrow Amount is exhausted, (b) second, as a setoff against any Earnout
payment that is then payable but not yet paid (but only to the extent the
claim is mutually agreed upon or finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction), (c) from Mettler and (d) finally, from the other Members.

Section 7.10. Characterization of Indemnification Payments. All payments made
(or deemed to be made, in accordance with this Agreement) by any Indemnifying
Person to an Indemnified Person with respect to any claim pursuant to Section
7.2 or Section 7.3 shall be treated, to the fullest extent possible under
applicable Law, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

Section 7.11. Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, except as provided in Section 2.3 (Post-Closing Determination) or for
the right of any party to seek specific performance, from and after the
Closing the rights and remedies of Buyer, the Company and the Members, and any
Buyer Indemnified Person and any Member Indemnified Person (each Buyer
Indemnified Person and Member Indemnified Person is referred to herein as an
"Indemnified Person"), under this Article 7 are exclusive and in lieu of any
and all other rights and remedies which Buyer, the Company or the Members, or
any Indemnified Person, may have under this Agreement or any Transaction
Document or otherwise against each other with respect to this Agreement or any
Transaction Document and with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, and each party expressly waives and releases and agrees to waive
and release any and all other rights or causes of action it or its Affiliates
may have against the other party or its Affiliates



now or in the future under any Law (regardless of the theory of recourse) with
respect to the preceding matters.

Section 7.12. Non-Recourse. Except as expressly set forth in this Article 7,
no party shall have recourse whatsoever under this Agreement against any of
the officers, directors, managers and/or employees of the other parties
(including for such purposes, the officers, directors, managers and/or
employees of any Affiliate of a party, but expressly excluding the Members)
with respect to the negotiation and documentation of this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as expressly set forth in
this Article 7, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and the
Members, on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates, each hereby fully and
irrevocably waives any right, claim or entitlement whatsoever against such
officers, directors, managers and/or employees relating to any and all Losses
suffered or incurred by any of them arising from, based upon, related to, or
associated with negotiation and execution this Agreement whether based on
contract, tort, strict liability other laws or otherwise and whether by
piercing of the corporate veil, by claim on behalf of or by a party hereto or
other Person or otherwise. For purposes of clarity, nothing in this Section
7.12 shall reduce or abridge the liability of the Members under this Article
7.

ARTICLE 8

MISCELLANEOUS



Section 8.1. Member Representative.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the Members hereby designate Mettler to
serve as the sole and exclusive representative of the Members (the "Member
Representative") with respect to those provisions of this Agreement that
contemplate action by the Member Representative and with respect to the Escrow
Agreement; provided, however, that if Mettler at any time is unable, due to
incapacity or otherwise, to serve as Member Representative or resigns as
Member Representative, then successive Member Representatives shall be chosen

immediately prior to the Closing. Each successor Member Representative, if
required to serve, shall sign an acknowledgment in writing agreeing to perform

Member any notice received by the Member Representative concerning this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Member

herewith, including the Escrow Agreement, (ii) execute and deliver and receive

of the Member Representative's duties under this Agreement for any errors in
judgment, negligence, oversight, breach of duty or otherwise except to the
extent it is finally determined in a court of competent jurisdiction by clear
and convincing evidence that the actions taken or not taken by the Member
Representative constituted fraud or were taken or not taken in bad faith. The
Member Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Members
against all losses, including costs of defense, paid or incurred in connection
with any action, suit, proceeding or claim to which the Member Representative
is made a party by reason of the fact that the Member Representative was
acting as the Member Representative pursuant to this Agreement; provided,

Section 8.3. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all Schedules and
Exhibits hereto) and the Transaction Documents contain the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with
respect to such matters.

Section 8.4. Amendment; Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and the Member Representative, or in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom such waiver is intended to be
effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

Section 8.5. No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Buyer
and the Member Representative and any purported assignment in violation of the
foregoing shall be null and void ab initio. Except as expressly set forth
herein in Section 6.3 or Article 7, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than Buyer, the Company
and the Members, and their respective successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns, any rights, benefits or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement.

Section 8.6. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring
such costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary herein all fees and expenses relating to the Escrow Agent shall be
paid one-half (1/2) by Buyer and one-half (1/2) by the Members.

Section 8.7. Disclosure Schedule.

(a) The "Disclosure Schedule" means that certain document (as may be modified
from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof) identified as the
Disclosure Schedule, dated as of the date hereof, delivered by the Company and
the Members to Buyer in connection with this Agreement. Each Section in the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to qualify the corresponding Section of
this Agreement and any other Section of this Agreement to which the
application of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. It is
specifically acknowledged that the Disclosure Schedule may expressly provide
exceptions to a particular Section of Articles 3 or 4 notwithstanding that the
Section does not state "except as set forth in Section '__' of the Disclosure
Schedule" or words of similar effect.



(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Disclosure Schedule is intended to vary the definition of Material Adverse
Effect or to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use
the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such
item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure
Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this
Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification of any
item or matter in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is intended
to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not
in the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not in
the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

(c) Each Section of the Disclosure Schedule is qualified in its entirety by
reference to specific provisions of this Agreement and does not constitute,
and shall not be construed as constituting, representations, warranties or
covenants of any party, except as and to the extent provided in this
Agreement. Certain matters set forth in the Disclosure Schedule are included
for informational purposes only notwithstanding that, because they do not rise
above applicable materiality thresholds or otherwise, they may not be required
by the terms of this to be set forth herein.

Section 8.8. Governing Law; Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of
Jury Trial.

Section 8.15. Certain Waivers.

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and

employees and Affiliates, that:



(i) Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe, LLP and Young Clement Rivers, LLP have
acted as counsel to the Members and the Member Representative (individually
and collectively, the "Seller Group"), and the Company in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer agrees, and shall
cause the Company to agree, that, following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, such representation and any prior representation of the
Company by Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe, LLP or Young Clement Rivers, LLP
(or any successor) (the "Seller Group Law Firms") shall not preclude Seller
Group Law Firms from serving as counsel to the Seller Group or any director,
member, shareholder, partner, officer or employee of the Seller Group, in
connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(ii) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, seek or have Seller
Group Law Firms disqualified from any such representation based upon the prior
representation of the Company by Seller Group Law Firms. Each of the parties
hereto hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising
from such prior representation, and each of such parties shall cause any of
its Affiliates to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation. Each of the parties acknowledges that such consent and waiver
is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and that the parties have
consulted with counsel or have been advised they should do so in connection
herewith. The covenants, consent and waiver contained in this Section shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Seller Group Law
Firms are entitled whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

(b) All communications between the Seller Group or the Company, on the one
hand, and Seller Group Law Firms, on the other hand, relating to the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Privileged
Communications") shall be deemed to be attorney-client privileged and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the
Seller Group and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Company.
Accordingly, Buyer and the Company shall not have access to any Privileged
Communications or to the files of Seller Group Law Firms relating to such
engagement from and after Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, (i) the Seller Group (and not Buyer or
the Company) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of Buyer or the Company shall be a holder
thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Seller Group Law Firms in respect of
such engagement constitute property of the client, only the Seller Group (and
not Buyer nor the Company) shall hold such property rights and (iii) Seller
Group Law Firms shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to Buyer or the Company by reason of
any attorney-client relationship between Seller Group Law Firms and the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company), on the one hand, and
a third party other than any of the Seller Group, on the other hand, Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Company) may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such third
party; provided, however, that neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Company) may waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Seller Group, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. In the event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates



(including the Company) is legally required by Governmental Order or otherwise
legally required to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the
Privileged Communications, to the extent (x) permitted by applicable Law, and
(y) advisable in the opinion of Buyer's counsel, then Buyer shall promptly
notify the Member Representative in writing so that the Member Representative
can seek a protective order.
