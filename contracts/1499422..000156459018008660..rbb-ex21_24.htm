(a)Subject to Section 2.2(e) and Section 2.3, each share of the common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Common Stock"), except for shares of
Company Common Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned by the
Company or Parent (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity
or as a result of debts previously contracted), shall be converted into the
right to receive (i) 1.3472 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the common stock,
no par value per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") and (ii) $15.30
in cash without interest (the "Cash Consideration") (such consideration set
forth in clauses (i) and (ii), the "Merger Consideration"); it being
understood that upon the Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.5, the Parent
Common Stock, including the shares issued to former holders of Company Common
Stock, shall be the common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b)All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a "Certificate," it being
understood that any reference herein to "Certificate" shall be deemed to
include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i)
a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted into the right
to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(e), without any
interest thereon, (iii) the Cash Consideration and (iv) any dividends or
distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.2. Certificates previously representing shares of Company Common
Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock (together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration
therefor) and the Cash Consideration upon the surrender of such Certificates
in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If, prior to
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged
for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or
there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.

Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company or Parent (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity
or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall

(a)At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under Company Stock Option Plans, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Option") shall become fully vested and be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in
cash, in lieu of each share of Company Common Stock that would otherwise have
been issuable upon exercise thereof, equal to (A) $51.00 less (B) the exercise
price per share with respect to the corresponding Company Stock Option in
question ("Option Consideration"), subject to all applicable withholding and
payroll taxes with respect to such options. Any Company Stock Option that has
an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or
equal to $51.00 shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration or
payment.

 

(b)At least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date and prior to, and as a
condition to, any such payment, the Company shall obtain a written
acknowledgement and waiver from each holder of Company Stock Option (in the
form of the Option Cancellation Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B) (i)
confirming the number of Company Stock Options held (and shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Options), (ii) confirming that the
treatment of such Company Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement and the
amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement have been correctly calculated
and (iii) acknowledging that in consideration for the cancellation of such
Company Stock Option, the holder agrees to accept the Option Cancellation
Agreement. The Company shall provide a copy of each such Option Cancellation
Agreement to Parent at least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c)At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company (the "Company Board of Directors") and its compensation committee,
as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.6.

Company that all conditions to the Closing have been satisfied or waived
(other than the delivery of opinions, certificates and other documents on the
Closing Date as

   

provided for herein), and in any event not later than five (5) business days
prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall fund the purchase by either Parent or
the Company from the Treasury of each share of the Company's TARP Community
Development Capital Initiative Shares ("Series B Preferred Stock"), issued and
outstanding on such date (such purchase, the "TARP Purchase"); provided,
however, that Parent agrees to provide financing for the entire amount of the
TARP Purchase for an interim period of up to one month.

Article II 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 

2.1Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange
agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates or, at Parent's
option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively, referred to
herein as "certificates"), representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued to holders of Company Common Stock, an amount in cash sufficient to
pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable to holders of Company Common
Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates
for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

 

2.2Exchange of Shares.

 

(a)As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than five (5) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted into
the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any dividends or
distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of
a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate or

   

Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable,
(i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check representing the
amount of (A) cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, which such holder has
the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, (B) the Cash Consideration and
(C) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to this Section 2.2, and the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any cash consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to
holders of Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive,
the Cash Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect
of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2. Company
shall cause its transfer agent to cooperate with Parent and the Exchange Agent
to provide Company shareholder records, as necessary and appropriate to effect
the Closing. 

 

(b)No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

 

(c)If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered,
or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d)After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in this
Article II.

   

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution
with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each
former shareholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive
such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of Parent
Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") as reported by The
Wall Street Journal for the five (5) full trading days ending on the day
preceding the Closing Date (the "Parent Share Closing Price") by (ii) the
fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

 

(f)Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders
of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of the Company who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares of Parent Common Stock,
the Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect
of each former share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

 

(g)Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental
authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect
of which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be.

 

(h)In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent or Exchange Agent
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of
Parent Common Stock, the Cash Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

   

2.3Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares ("Dissenting Shares") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a
holder who has not voted to adopt this Agreement or assented thereto in
writing and has the right to demand and has properly demanded payment of the
fair value of such shares by filing a written notice of such holder\'s
election to dissent from the Merger in accordance with Section 623 of the
NYBCL ("Section 623"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1 of this Agreement, but rather
the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 623 and Section 910
of the NYBCL ("Section 910"); provided, however, that if any such holder fails
to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to dissent under
Section 623 and Section 910, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder\'s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been canceled, extinguished and converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1, without
interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) a prompt written notice of
any demands received by the Company for dissenting of any shares of Company
Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice
or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the NYBCL that relates to such demand, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

2.4Shareholders Agreements. All directors of the Company have entered into
agreements in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C commensurate with the
execution of this Agreement by the parties hereto.

and warrants to Parent as follows:

 

3.1Corporate Organization.

 

(a)The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of New York. The Company is registered
as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (the "BHC Act"). The Company has the corporate power and authority to
own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. True and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company (the "Company Certificate") and the By-Laws of the Company (the
"Company Bylaws"), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by the Company to Parent. As used in this
Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to the Company, shall
have the meaning ascribed to it in Section 2.2(d) of the BHC Act. As used in
this Agreement, the term "Significant Subsidiary" shall mean each Subsidiary
which is a "significant subsidiary" as defined in Regulation S-X, promulgated
by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as in
effect as of the date hereof. All of the Subsidiaries of the Company are
listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule with a designation of which
Subsidiaries are Significant Subsidiaries.

   

(b)Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company (i) is duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is
duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so
qualified would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own
or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. The deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of the Company that is an
insured depository institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest
extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the
termination of such insurance are pending or threatened.

 

3.2Capitalization.

 

(a)The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 3,000,000 shares of
Company Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 750,000 shares of Series A
preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share ("Series A Preferred Stock") and
17,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share (together
with Series A Preferred Stock, "Company Preferred Stock"). As of April 16,
2018, there are (i) 2,204,046 shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding, (ii) 17,000 Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding (iii)
2,500 shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury, (iv) 54,500 shares of

voting securities of the Company issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on which
shareholders of the Company may vote. Section 3.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth all of the issued and outstanding trust
preferred securities ("Trust Preferred Securities") or subordinated debt
securities of the Company and the outstanding capital stock and debt
securities of each Subsidiary. Other than Company Stock Options, there are no
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights,
exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements
obligating the Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire, any such securities. There are no voting trusts, shareholder
agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect with respect to the voting
or transfer of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests of Company.

 

(b)The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the
Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all of such
shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to the Company Bank,
as provided in Section 114 of New York Banking Law) and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Except
(i) as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule (ii) for the Company's
ownership in its Subsidiaries, (iii) for securities held

   

for the benefit of third parties in trust accounts, managed accounts and the
like for the benefit of customers and (iv) for securities acquired after the
date of this Agreement in satisfaction of debts previously contracted in good
faith, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns or
controls, directly or indirectly, any shares of stock or other equity interest
in any corporation, firm, partnership, joint venture or other entity. No
Company Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

 

(c)Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of March
31, 2018, a true, correct and complete list of all Company Stock Options
outstanding as of the date hereof specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (i)
the name of each holder, (ii) the number of shares subject to each such
Company Stock Option, (iii) the grant date of each such Company Stock Option,
and (iv) the exercise price for each such Company Stock Option.

this Agreement and, subject to the shareholder, regulatory and other actions
described below, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof and the Company Bank has the full corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms
thereof. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of

Agreement, (x) approving this Agreement, (y) resolving to submit this

has determined that the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and
has directed that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be
submitted to the Company's shareholders for adoption at a meeting of such
shareholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for
the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Requisite
Company Vote"), and the adoption and approval of the Bank Merger Agreement by
the Company as its sole shareholder, and receipt of all necessary regulatory
approvals and waivers, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company or the Company Bank are necessary to approve this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies (the "Enforceability Exceptions")).

   

(b)Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Bank Merger, nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or
provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Company Certificate
or the Company Bylaws or (ii) assuming that the consents and approvals
referred to in Section 3.4 are duly obtained, (x) violate any statute, code,

termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of
clause (y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

3.4Consents and Approvals. Except for (a) the filing of applications, filings
and notices, as applicable, with the NASDAQ, (b) the filing of applications,
filings or notices with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two
(2) years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)"

3.11Employees and Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a)Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all material
Company Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Benefit
Plans" means all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the

respects with respect to each Company Benefit Plan. All contributions required
to be made under the terms of any Company Benefit Plan have been timely made
in all material respects.

 

(c)No Company Benefit Plan is or has been funded by, associated with, or
related to a "voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning
of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning
of Section 419 of the Code, a "qualified asset account" within the meaning of
Section 419A of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within
the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.

 

(d)Each Company Benefit Plan which is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) has been operated in
material compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by
the IRS with respect to such plans.

 

(e)Neither Company nor the Company Bank has any obligation to provide any
current or former employee, officer, director, consultant or other service
provider any health, disability or life benefits beyond his or her retirement
or other termination of service under any Company Benefit Plan, other than
healthcare continuation coverage mandated by applicable law. 

 

(f)Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in material compliance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable
laws, including ERISA and the Code.

   

(g)Section 3.11(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Company
Benefit Plan that is intended to be a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a)
of the Code (the "Company Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable
determination letter with respect to each Company Qualified Plan and the
related trust or the Company Qualified Plan is maintained pursuant to a volume
submitter or prototype document for which it may properly rely on the
applicable opinion or advisory letter, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Company
Qualified Plan or the related trust.

 

(h)None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed
to or been obligated to contribute to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA,
including a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA ("Multiemployer Plan") and a plan that has two or more contributing
sponsors, at least two of whom are not under common control, within the
meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA ("Multiple Employer Plan"). For purposes of
this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect to any entity, trade or
business, any other entity, trade or business that is, or was at the relevant
time, a member of a group described in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes or included the first
entity, trade or business, or that is, or was at the relevant time, a member
of the same "controlled group" as the first entity, trade or business pursuant
to Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

 

(i)With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code: (i) no such
Company Benefit Plan is in "at-risk" status for purposes of Section 430 of the
Code, (ii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA
for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred,
(iii) all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC")
have been timely paid in full, (iv) no material liability (other than for
premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is reasonably
expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (v) the
PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Company Benefit
Plan. No Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by the Company or its
ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company
or its ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability to Company and its Subsidiaries. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Controlled Group Liability" means any and all liabilities (1)
under Title IV of ERISA, (2) under Section 302 of ERISA, (3) under Sections
412 and 4971 of the Code, and (4) as a result of a failure to comply with the
continuing coverage requirements of Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA and Section
4980B of the Code.

 

(j)Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors any employee
benefit plan that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health
or medical or life insurance benefits for retired or former employees or their
dependents, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

   

(k)All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document, and all premiums due or payable with
respect to insurance policies funding any Company Benefit Plan, for any period
through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the
extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been
fully reflected on the books and records of the Company, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither any
Company Benefit Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an
outstanding funding waiver. Neither Company nor the Company Bank has provided,
and neither is required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any
single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of
the Code.

 

(l)There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to the Company's knowledge, no set of circumstances exists
that may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against
the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their
duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under
any of the Company Benefit Plans, except as, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(m)Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any
assets to fund any material benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, or
increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any
employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
result in any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from
any Company Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in
the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof
or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event),
other than payments made by the Parent or its Subsidiaries including the
Surviving Corporation (other than under the Company Benefit Plans as in effect
at the time of execution and delivery of this Agreement), will be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any plan, program,
agreement or arrangement that provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (or any corresponding provisions
of state or local law relating to Tax).

 

(n)There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
material labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other
material labor disputes against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to or bound by any
collective bargaining or similar agreement with any labor organization, or
work rules or practices agreed to with any labor organization or employee
association applicable to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no organizing efforts by any
union or other group seeking to represent any employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

(a)The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold all licenses, franchises,
permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties, rights and
assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and assessments due
and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the cost of failure
to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit
or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit
or authorization is threatened. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
complied in all material respects with and are not in material default or

of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2016.

 

(c)Company has a privacy policy (a "Privacy Policy") regarding the collection

it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. True and complete copies of the Parent Certificate and Parent
Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been

31, 2017 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31,
2017, or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(c)The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parent's outside
auditors and the audit committee of Parent's Board of Directors (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) to
the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal
controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no
reason to believe that Parent's

   

outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

(d)Since January 1, 2015, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to
the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices.

connection with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

4.8Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

(a)Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to
Parent's knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of
any nature against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their current
or former directors or executive officers or challenging the validity or
propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b)There is no injunction, order, judgment, or decree imposed upon Parent, any
of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or
that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to Parent or any of its
affiliates) that would reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

   

4.10Taxes and Tax Returns. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has duly and
timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in
all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any extension

due have been fully and timely paid. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has
withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid
in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor,
shareholder, independent contractor or other third party. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation
period applicable to any material Tax that remains in effect. The federal
income Tax Returns of Parent and its Subsidiaries for all years to and
including 2011 have been examined by the IRS or are Tax Returns with respect
to which the applicable period for assessment under applicable law, after
giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of assessment or proposed
assessment in connection with any material amount of Taxes, and there are no
threatened in writing or pending disputes, claims, audits, examinations or
other proceedings regarding any material Tax of Parent and its Subsidiaries or
the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Parent has made available to the
Company true and complete copies of any private letter ruling requests,
closing agreements or gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes
requested or executed in the last three (3) years. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or
indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or
arrangement exclusively between or among Parent and its Subsidiaries).
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a
group the common parent of which was Parent) or (B) has any liability for the
Taxes of any person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2)
years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)"
within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a
part, a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
intending to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(1).
At no time during the past five (5) years has Parent been a United States real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code.

 

4.11Employees and Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a)For purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Benefit Plans" means all employee
benefit plans (as defined in Section 3.3 of ERISA, whether or not subject to
ERISA, and all stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive,
deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental
retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements,
retention, bonus, employment, change in control, termination or severance
plans, programs, agreements or arrangements that are maintained, contributed
to or sponsored or maintained by, or required to be contributed to, Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of any current or former employee,
officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

   

(b)Parent has heretofore made available to the Company true and complete
copies of (i) each material Parent Benefit Plan, including any amendments
thereto and all related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding
vehicles, and (ii) to the extent applicable, (A) the most recent summary plan
description, if any, required under ERISA with respect to such Parent Benefit
Plan, (B) the most recent annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the
IRS, (C) the most recently received IRS determination letter, if any, relating
to such Parent Benefit Plan, (D) the most recently prepared actuarial report
for each Parent Benefit Plan (if applicable), and (E) all material
correspondence to or from any Governmental Entity received in the last three
years with respect to such Parent Benefit Plan. All required reports and
descriptions (including but not limited to Form 5500 annual reports and
required attachments, summary annual reports, Forms PBGC-1 and summary plan
descriptions) have been filed or distributed appropriately in all material
respects with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan. All contributions required
to be made under the terms of any Parent Benefit Plan have been timely made in
all material respects.

 

(c)No Parent Benefit Plan is or has been funded by, associated with, or
related to a "voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning
of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning
of Section 419 of the Code, a "qualified asset account" within the meaning of
Section 419A of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within
the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.

 

(d)Each Parent Benefit Plan which is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) has been operated in
material compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by
the IRS with respect to such plans.

 

(e)Each Parent Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered in
material compliance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable
laws, including ERISA and the Code.

 

(f)The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each
Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code (the "Parent Qualified Plans") and the related trust or the Parent
Qualified Plan is maintained pursuant to a volume submitter or prototype
document for which it may properly rely on the applicable opinion or advisory
letter, and, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no existing circumstances
and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the qualified status of any Parent Qualified Plan or the related trust.

 

(g)With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code: (i) no such
Parent Benefit Plan is in "at-risk" status for purposes of Section 430 of the
Code, (ii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA
for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred,

premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is reasonably
expected to be incurred by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and (v) the PBGC
has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Parent Benefit Plan. No
Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by Parent or its ERISA Affiliates
that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the knowledge of Parent, no
condition exists

   

that presents a material risk to Parent or its ERISA Affiliates of incurring
any such liability, except as, either individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to Parent and
its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, "Controlled Group
Liability" means any and all liabilities (1) under Title IV of ERISA, (2)
under Section 302 of ERISA, (3) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, and
(4) as a result of a failure to comply with the continuing coverage
requirements of Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code.

 

(h)None of the Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed
to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan.

 

(i)Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors any employee benefit
plan that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health or
medical or life insurance benefits for retired or former employees or their
dependents, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

 

(j)All contributions required to be made to any Parent Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document, and all premiums due or payable with
respect to insurance policies funding any Parent Benefit Plan, for any period
through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the
extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been
fully reflected on the books and records of Parent, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability to Parent and its Subsidiaries. Neither any Parent
Benefit Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an
outstanding funding waiver. Neither Parent nor the Parent Bank has provided,
and neither is required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any
single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of
the Code.

 

(k)There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to Parent's knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that
may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the
Parent Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to
the Parent Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Parent Benefit Plans, except as, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to Parent
or and its Subsidiaries.

 

(l)There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened material
labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor
disputes against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is party to or bound by any collective bargaining or similar
agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices agreed to
with any labor organization or employee association applicable to employees of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Parent, there are
no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking to represent any
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective
businesses and ownership of their respective properties, rights and assets
under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to
hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit or
authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, and, to the knowledge of Parent, no suspension or
cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization
is threatened. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with and are not in material default or violation under any,

Parent, investigation into the business or operations of the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2016.

(d)Neither the Parent nor the Parent Bank has received any written notice that
either the Parent or the Parent Bank is in default with respect to any order,
writ, injunction or decree of any court, or in default under any orders or
licenses of any Governmental Authority, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Parent.

 

4.13Certain Contracts.

 

(a)Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or
oral) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound
as of the date hereof has been filed as an exhibit to the most recent Annual

Current Report on Form 8-K subsequent thereto (each, a "Parent Contract"), and
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice
of, any violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto which would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

(b)In each case, except as, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (i) each
Parent Contract is valid and binding on Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and in full force and effect, (ii) Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all obligations required

Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or
requesting any such Parent Regulatory Agreement.

Parent any private environmental investigations or remediation activities or
governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition, on the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising under any
Environmental Law, pending or threatened against Parent, which liability or
obligation would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To the knowledge of Parent,

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent;
(ii) neither the Parent nor the Parent Bank is subject to any material

Parent nor the Parent Bank has received any notice, demand letter, claim or
request for information alleging any violation of, or liability under, any

Article VI 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

6.1Regulatory Matters.

 

(a)Parent shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than 60
days hereafter) prepare and file with the SEC (and the Company shall cooperate
in connection therewith), the S-4, including the Proxy Statement, satisfying
all applicable requirements of federal law, including the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing and to keep the S-4 effective for so long as necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company
shall thereafter as promptly as practicable mail or deliver the Proxy
Statement to its shareholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of Company

   

Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action. Company shall provide Parent with any information concerning itself
that Parent may reasonably request in connection with the drafting and
preparation of the Proxy Statement and the S-4, and Parent shall notify
Company promptly of the receipt of any comments of the SEC or any blue sky
administrator with respect to the S-4, including the Proxy Statement, and of
any requests by the SEC or any blue sky administrator for any amendment or
supplement thereto or for additional information and shall provide to Company
promptly copies of all correspondence between Parent or any of their
representatives and the SEC. Parent shall give Company and its counsel the
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and the S-4 prior to
them being filed with the SEC and shall give Company and its counsel the
opportunity to review and comment on all amendments and supplements to the
S-4, and the Proxy Statement and all responses to requests for additional
information and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent
to, the SEC or any blue sky administrator. Each of the Parent and Company
agrees to use all reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other
Party hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the
SEC or any blue sky administrator and to cause the Proxy Statement and all
required amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of
Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company Meeting at the earliest
practicable time. Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other Party if
at any time it becomes aware that the Proxy Statement or the S-4 contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In such
event, Company shall cooperate with Parent in the preparation of a supplement
or amendment to such S-4 or Proxy Statement that corrects such misstatement or
omission, and Parent shall file an amended S-4, including the Proxy Statement,
with the SEC and blue sky administrators, as applicable, which amended Proxy
Statement shall be mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to
vote at the Company Meeting at the earliest practicable time.

 

(b)The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable
best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to
effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly
as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of
all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such
Governmental Entities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as
soon as practicable and in no event later than forty-five (45) business days
after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any
applications, notices and filings required to be filed with any bank
regulatory agency in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.
Parent and the Company shall each use, and shall each cause their applicable
Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain each such Requisite
Regulatory Approval as promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information,
which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The
parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all permits, consents,

   

approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party
shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the
other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences.

 

(c)Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d)To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, Parent and the Company
shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory
Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed. As used in this Agreement, the "Requisite Regulatory
Approvals" shall mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or
approvals from (x) the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the DFS and the DBO
and (y) any other approvals set forth in Sections 3.4 and 4.4 that are
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger and the Bank Merger, except for any such authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals the failure of which to be obtained would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation.

 

6.2Access to Information and Confidentiality.

 

(a)The parties agree that, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent
shall afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives of the other, access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, records, officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives and, during such period, such party shall make available to
the other (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of Federal securities laws or Federal or state banking, consumer
finance or protection laws (other than reports or documents which such party
is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
party may reasonably request. Company and the Company Bank further agree that
until the Effective Time, Company and the Company Bank shall provide the
following reports to Parent and Parent Bank on a monthly basis: (i) past due
loans, nonperforming loan report, non-accrual loan, problem loan and OREO
reports, (ii) loan risk grade changes, (iii) new and renewed loans, (iv) loan
trial balance by risk code, (v) detailed general ledger balance sheet and
income statement, and (vi) monthly board and committee

   

packages. The Company and the Company Bank shall assist Parent and Parent
Bank with the integration of operations that is expected to begin shortly
after this Agreement is executed. Such party shall not be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

 

(b)Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other party or any of such party's Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreements, dated January 18, 2018 (the "Company Confidentiality Agreement")
and April 5, 2018 (the "Parent Confidentiality Agreement" and, together with
the Company Confidentiality Agreement, the "Confidentiality Agreements").

 

(c)No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

 

6.3Shareholders' Approvals

 

.

 

(a)The Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders (the "Company Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable after
the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Company Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and,
upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special
meeting of shareholders to adopt a merger agreement as the Company reasonably
determines. The Company Board of Directors shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from the shareholders of the Company, the Requisite Company
Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and
including the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that they adopt
and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and
Company shall take all other lawful action necessary or advisable (subject to
the Company Board of Directors' exercise of its fiduciary duties, including
postponing or adjourning the Company Meeting to make any communication
permitted by this Agreement or to obtain a quorum or to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement) to obtain the Required
Company Vote.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 6.3(a) and subject to
Sections 8.1 and 8.2, if the Company Board of Directors, prior to the
Requisite Company Vote, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and,
with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good
faith that it would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in
submitting this Agreement to its shareholders, the Company Board of Directors
may (but shall not be required to) submit this Agreement to the Company's
shareholders without a recommendation or may change, qualify or modify the
Company Recommendation (although the

   

resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board of Directors may
communicate the basis for such change to the Company Recommendation to the
Company's shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by law; provided, that the Company
Board of Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless (A) it
gives Parent (i) at least five (5) business days' prior written notice of any
intended meeting of the Company Board of Directors at which the Board intends
to consider and determine whether to submit this Agreement without a
recommendation or otherwise change, qualify or modify the Company
Recommendation (including specifying in such written notice the date and time
of such intended meeting); (ii) a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including,
in the event such action is taken by the Company Board of Directors in
response to a Superior Proposal (as defined below), a copy of such Superior
Proposal, including the latest material terms and conditions of, and the
identity of the third party making, such Superior Proposal, or any amendment
or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or
circumstance); and (B) at the end of such notice period, (i) after receipt by
Parent of the information and notice described in clause (A), Parent notifies
the Company in writing, at least two (2) business day prior to such meeting of
the Company Board of Directors, of any proposed amendment or modification to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (ii) the Company Board of
Directors takes into account such amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed by Parent and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and,
with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, nevertheless
determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or
modifying of the Company Recommendation by the Company Board of Directors
shall not change the approval of the Company Board of Directors for purposes
of causing any takeover laws to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. 

 

(c)The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting, if, as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient
shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be
convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of the
Company at the Company Meeting for the purpose of voting on the adoption of
this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate to hold the
Company Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, subject to Parent's compliance with its obligations pursuant to
Section 6.1.

 

6.4Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on such party or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to
the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other party to obtain) any material

   

consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

6.5Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.6Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a)During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to
be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) immediately following the Effective Time for so long as
such employee is employed following the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Continuing Employees") with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as
applicable (including commission rate, if applicable), that is no less
favorable than such base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, provided by
the Company or any such Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual short-term cash incentive
opportunity that is substantially comparable to the annual short-term cash
incentive opportunity provided by the Parent to its similarly situated
employees, and (iii) other compensation, including long-term incentive
opportunities, and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to either (A) the other compensation, including long-term incentive
opportunities, and employee benefits provided by the Company or any such
Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
or (B) the other compensation, including long-term incentive opportunities,
and employee benefits provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of
Parent. Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, provide
to each Continuing Employee whose employment terminates during the 12-month
period following the Closing Date with severance benefits equal to the greater
of (A) the severance benefits for which such Continuing Employee was eligible
immediately prior to the Closing under the applicable Company Benefit Plan set
forth in Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (B) the
severance benefits for which such Continuing Employee would be eligible under
the severance plans or policies of Parent or its Affiliates, in each case,
determined (1) without taking into account any reduction after the Closing in
compensation paid to such Continuing Employee and (2) taking into account each
Continuing Employee's service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor entities) and, after the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b)With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries in
which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after the
Effective Time (the "New Plans"), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii)

   

provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee or dependent prior to the
Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such
credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-
of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of
such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any
New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the
foregoing service recognition shall not apply (x) to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (y) for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension or the employer
premium subsidy under any retiree medical plan, or (z) to any benefit plan
that is a frozen plan or that provides benefits to a grandfathered employee
population.

 

(c)Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Bank shall pay on
the last day prior to the Effective Time any and all obligations arising out
of or the employment agreements and in the amounts set forth next to each such
agreement and employee listed on Company Disclosure Schedule ("Employment
Agreements") to employees of the Company or the Company Bank whose employment
will terminate at the Effective Time, to the extent payments are due at such
time; provided, however, that if amounts cannot be paid at such time under
Section 409A of the Code, such amounts shall be transferred to a rabbi trust
as provided in such agreement and plan.

 

(d)All Company employees will be paid their accrued vacation on Company's last
payroll. All retained Company Bank employees will be incorporated into
Parent's vacation and benefits structure at the Effective Time and will be
immediately eligible to participate in Parent's plans other than equity plans.
The Company shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by the Company
(each, a "Company 401(k) Plan") to be terminated effective as of the day
immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of
the Closing. (i) The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such
plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to
reasonable review and comment by Parent) not later than two (2) days
immediately preceding the Effective Time and (ii) the Continuing Employees of
the Company shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan sponsored or
maintained by Parent or one of its subsidiaries (a "Parent 401(k) Plan"), and
commence elective deferrals thereunder (and be eligible to receive matching
contributions), effective as of the Effective Time and the Parent shall take
any and all actions as may be required, including amending the Parent 401(k)
Plan (if necessary), to comply with this subparagraph (ii). Parent and the
Company shall take any and all actions as may be required, including
amendments to any Company 401(k) Plan and/or Parent 401(k) Plan, to permit the
Continuing Employees of the Company who are then actively employed to make
rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the
form of cash, notes (in the case of loans), or a combination thereof in an
amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Continuing
Employee of the Company from a Company 401(k) Plan. As of the Effective Time
all benefits in the 401(k) plan will be fully vested.

   

(e)Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director
or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates any
right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, the
Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, the Company,
Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter
or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit
Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time in accordance with such plan's terms.
Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
person, including, without limitation, any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement. 

 

6.7Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

 

(a)From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, each present and former director, officer or employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity)(collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties") against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective
Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and pertaining to
matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance
expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate with the Company Indemnified Party, and the Company
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

 

(b)For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Company shall,
in consultation with Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain at or
prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the Company's
existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage
to that described in the succeeding sentence (including maximum coverage of up
to $10 million). Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail
policy" in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder. In the event that such "tail policy" cannot be obtained in
accordance with the preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and

   

officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided, that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially
comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured; provided
further, that the Surviving Corporation will notify the Company thereof no
later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing) with respect to claims
against the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);
provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on
an annual basis, an amount in excess of 250% of the current annual premium
paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the "Premium
Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the
Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation's good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. 

 

(c)The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company under
this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time
in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any
other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior
written consent of the affected Company Indemnified Party or affected person.

 

(d)The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge
into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or
deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction, then in
each case to the extent the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7 are not
otherwise transferred and assumed by such successors and assigns by operation
of law or otherwise, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 

6.8Advice of Changes. Parent and the Company (in such capacity, the
"Notifying Party") shall each promptly advise the other party of any change or
event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Notifying Party or (ii) which the Notifying Party believes would
or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any
of the Notifying Party's representations, warranties or covenants contained
herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition set forth in, if Parent is the
Notifying Party, Sections 7.1 or 7.3, or if the Company is the Notifying
Party, Sections 7.1 or 7.2; provided, that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed
to constitute a violation of this Section 6.8 or the failure of any condition
set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a
breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each
case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied.

   

6.9Corporate Governance.

 

(a)On or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent shall
(i) ensure that the Parent Bylaws so permit and that the full Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time may be increased
by two, (ii) at the meeting of the Board of Directors of Parent one month
prior to Closing, appoint Mr. Raymond Yu and one additional then current
director of the Company designated by the Company that is reasonably
acceptable to the Board of Directors of Parent and the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee of Parent to the Parent Board of Directors at
the Effective Time, and (iii) ensure that such persons are nominated by the
Nominating Committee of the Surviving Corporation as directors for the
following three years in a manner consistent with its consideration of other
incumbent directors, provided, that, such persons continue to meet the
qualifications for election as a director of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b)On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent (as the sole shareholder of
Parent Bank) shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full
Board of Directors of Parent Bank at the Effective Time to be increased by
two, constituted in the same manner and with the same individuals as the Board
of Directors of the Surviving Corporation and consistent with the other
provisions of Section 6.9(a).

 

(c)At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall invite each
member of the Company Board of Directors immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than those individuals who have joined or will join the Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the terms set forth
in Section 6.9(a)) to serve as a member of a regional advisory board for a
period of three (3) years from the Closing Date.

 

(d)One month prior to Closing, commensurate with Mr. Yu being appointed to the
Board of Directors of Parent as provided in Section 6.9(a), Parent shall cause
Mr. Yu to be appointed Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Parent and
to be appointed Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Parent Bank, in
each case, as of the Effective Time, and to be so appointed as Vice Chairman
of the Board of Directors of Parent and of Parent Bank thereafter on an annual
basis until such time that Mr. Yu no longer serves as a director on the Board
of Directors of Parent or the Parent Bank. 

 

6.10Acquisition Proposals.

 

(a)The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors,
agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "Representatives") not to,
(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries
or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person concerning any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic
information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to
any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify a person that has made or, to the
knowledge of the Company, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is
considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of the
provisions of this Section 6.10(a); provided, that, prior to the adoption of
this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company by the Requisite Company
Vote, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited

   

bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the execution of this Agreement,
it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries'
Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or
data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that
its Board of Directors concludes in good faith that (A) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be likely to
result in a Superior Proposal and (B) that, after considering the advice of
its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisor, determines in good faith that failure to take such actions would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company's shareholders under applicable law; provided, further, that, prior to
providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the
foregoing proviso, the Company shall have entered into a confidentiality
agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the
Parent Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not
provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company.
The Company will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will promptly (within two (2) business days, and in any
event at least five (5) business days prior to the first meeting of the
Company Board of Directors at which such Acquisition Proposal would be
presented for consideration) advise Parent following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the person making such Acquisition
Proposal), and will keep Parent reasonably apprised of any related material
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing
confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof.

 

(b)Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
from making any legally required disclosure to the Company's shareholders;
provided, that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that
any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

(c)For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i)"Acquisition Proposal" means, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, a tender or exchange offer to acquire 25% or more of the
voting power in the Company or the Company Bank, a proposal for a merger,
consolidation, or other business combination involving the Company or the
Company Bank or any other proposal or offer to acquire in any manner 25% or
more of the voting power in, or 25% or more of the business, assets or
deposits of, the Company or the Company Bank.

 

(ii)"Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such term
changed from 25% to 50%) that the Company Board of Directors concludes in good
faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders
than the Merger and the other transactions

   

contemplated hereby (including taking into account any adjustment to the terms
and conditions proposed by Parent in response to such proposal), (1) after
receiving the advice of its financial advisor, (2) after taking into account
the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth
therein (as compared to, and with due regard for, the terms herein), and (3)
after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel),
financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted under
applicable law.

 

6.11Public Announcements. The Company and Parent shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan to ensure that
all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and will not issue any press release or written statement
for general circulation relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or
make any such public statements without the prior consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a
party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after
consultation with the other party), issue such press release or public
statements as may be required by applicable law or the rules and regulations
of any stock exchange.

 

6.12Change of Method. The Parent shall be empowered, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the combination
of the Company and Parent (including the provisions of Article I), if and to
the extent they both deem such change to be necessary, appropriate or
desirable; provided, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the
Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of Parent Common Stock received by the
Company's shareholders in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock or
the Cash Consideration, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the
Company's shareholders or Parent's shareholders pursuant to this Agreement,
(iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Company or Parent pursuant to
this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The parties
agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement
executed by both parties in accordance with Section 9.2.

 

6.13Takeover Statutes. None of the Company, Parent or their respective Boards
of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to
become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to
be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 

6.14Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). Prior to the Effective
Time, the parties will each take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common Stock in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

   

6.15Assumption of Company Debt. Parent agrees to execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation, at or prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental
indentures, guarantees, and other instruments required for the due assumption
of the Company's obligations in respect of its outstanding debt, guarantees,
securities, and other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such
debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements, including the Trust
Preferred Securities and the related subordinated debt of the Company.

 

6.16Transition. Commencing following the date hereof, and in all cases
subject to applicable law, Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
cooperate with Parent and its Subsidiaries to facilitate the integration of
the parties and their respective businesses and operating systems effective as
of the Closing Date or such later date as may be reasonably determined by
Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof
through the Closing Date and consistent with the performance of their day-to-
day operations and the continuous operation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the employees, officers and
representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide information,
data and support, including information, data and support from their outside
contractors and vendors, and to assist Parent in performing all tasks
reasonably required to result in a successful integration at the Closing or
such later date as may be reasonably determined by Parent, including, without
limitation, cooperating with Parent to establish a mutually agreeable project
plan to effectuate Company data processing conversion; provided, however, that
it is acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that such data processing
conversion shall occur as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing. Parent and Company further agree that all actions taken pursuant to
this Section 6.16 shall be taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption
to the customary business activities of the Company and Company Bank. 

 

6.17Tax Treatment of the Merger. The parties intend for the Merger to qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each
party will both before and after the Effective Time (i) use reasonable efforts
to cause the Merger to so qualify; and (ii) refrain from taking any action
that would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to so qualify.

 

6.18Shareholder and Confidentiality Agreement. Company and the Company Bank
have delivered to Parent and Parent Bank the Shareholders Agreements,
substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto, executed by each of the Persons
identified on Exhibit C-1 hereto.

 

6.19FIRPTA Certificate. Each of the Company and the Company Bank shall
furnish to Parent a certification that its stock is not a United States real
property interest (as the term is defined in the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated in connection therewith), dated not more than 30 days
prior to the Effective Date, in compliance with Treasury Regulations Sections
1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h), in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

Article VIII 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

8.1Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of Parent or the Company:

 

(a)by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument, if the
Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

 

(b)by either Parent or the Company upon written notice to the other party if
the approval of any Governmental Entity required for consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is denied by
final, non-appealable action of such Governmental Entity; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with any provision
of this Agreement has been the cause of, or materially contributed to, such
action;

 

(c)by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before April 30, 2019 (the "Termination Date"), or such
later date as shall have been agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company,
provided, however, that no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(c) if the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or before
said date was due to such party's material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein;

 

(d)by either Parent or the Company if the Requisite Company Vote required for
the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the
failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of such
shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

 

(e)by either Parent or the Company (provided, that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by
Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach,
either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party,
would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by
Parent, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by

   

the Company, and which is not cured within forty-five (45) days following
written notice to the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or
Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, or by its nature or
timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior
to the Termination Date);

 

(f)by Parent prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if
(i) the Company Board of Directors shall have (A) failed to recommend in the
Proxy Statement that the shareholders of the Company adopt this Agreement, or
withdrawn, modified or qualified the Company Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent, or publicly disclosed that it has resolved to do so, or
failed to recommend against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer
constituting a Superior Proposal that has been publicly disclosed within ten
(10) business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, in
any such case whether or not permitted by the terms hereof or (B) approved,
adopted or endorsed a Superior Proposal, or (ii) the Company or its Board of
Directors has breached its obligations under Section 6.3 and 6.10 in any
material respect; or

 

(g)By the Company, if the Company has received a Superior Proposal and has
entered into an acquisition agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,
provided that the Company is not in breach of its obligations under Section
6.3 and Section 6.10 of this Agreement. 

 

(h)Notice of Termination. In the event a Party elects to effect any
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b) through Section 8.1(g) above, it shall
give written notice to the other Party specifying the basis for such
termination.

 

8.2Effect of Termination.

 

(a)In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 6.2(b) and this
Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any termination of this Agreement,
and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement occurring prior to termination (which, in the case
of the Company, shall include the loss to the holders of Company Common Stock
of the economic benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the premium
offered to the holders of Company Common Stock, it being understood that the
Company shall be entitled to pursue damages for such losses and to enforce the
right to recover such losses on behalf of its shareholders and the holders in
its sole and absolute discretion, and any amounts received by the Company in
connection therewith may be retained by the Company).

 

(b)In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management of the Company or has been made directly
to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and
not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with

   

respect to the Company and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent or the Company pursuant Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(d) without
the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained (and all other conditions set
forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 had been satisfied or were capable of being
satisfied prior to such termination) or (B) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) as a result of a willful
breach, and (C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of
such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or
consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company
shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and
the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of
same day funds, a fee equal to $5 million (the "Termination Fee"); provided,
that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "50%" shall instead refer to "75%".

 

(c)In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(f) or by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then the Company
shall pay the Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee
on the date of termination. 

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other
party's fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, in the event that this Agreement is terminated as provided in
Section 8.1, the maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or
damages payable by a single party under this Agreement shall be equal to the
Termination Fee, and neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(e)Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent or the Company fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee, such non-paying
party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In
addition, if Parent or the Company, as the case may be, fails to pay the
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay
interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date
that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the
date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum
equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any
successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to
be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by Parent and the
Company, as applicable, pursuant to Section 8.2(b) constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or willful and
material breach of this Agreement, shall be the sole monetary remedy of the
Company and Parent, as applicable, in the event of a termination of this
Agreement specified in such section.

Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith

under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

 

9.13Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

9.14Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any
signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement,
and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver
a signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that any

OPTION HOLDER AGREEMENT

 

__________________, 2018

Re:Options to Purchase Stock

 

Ladies/Gentlemen:

 

Reference is hereby made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Merger Agreement") dated ______________, 2018, by and between RBB Bancorp
("Parent") and First American International Corp. ("the Company") pursuant to
which the Company will be merged with and into Parent (the "Merger") and the
separate corporate existence of the Company will cease, and immediately
thereafter, Company Bank will merge with and into Parent Bank. Capitalized
terms used herein but not defined shall have their respective meanings set
forth in the Merger Agreement.

 

I previously have been granted options to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock, pursuant to one or more stock option agreements (the "Option
Agreements") between the Company and me, each and every one of which are
listed on the attachment to this letter agreement (this "Agreement"). With
respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which I have
unexercised options under the Option Agreements to purchase such shares, which
number of shares is also set forth on the attachment (the "Covered Options"),
I acknowledge and agree that immediately prior to consummation of the Merger
described above (the "Effective Time"), my Covered Options shall be terminated
with no further action necessary on my part. 

 

In consideration therefor, I shall receive, in lieu of the Covered Options and
each share of Company Common Stock that otherwise would have been issuable
upon exercise of the Covered Options, and at such time as set forth in the
Merger Agreement, an amount in cash without interest equal to (i)(A) $51.00
minus (B) the exercise price per share with respect to the Covered Option in
question, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
otherwise would have been issuable upon such exercise (such amount, the
"Option Termination Consideration"). If the Option Termination Consideration
determined for any Covered Option is less than zero, such Covered Option shall
be cancelled without payment of any Option Termination Consideration. I
acknowledge that the Option Termination Consideration to be received by me
pursuant to this Agreement, and the Merger Agreement, are adequate
consideration for my agreement to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the cancelation of the Option Agreements and
the Covered Options and the release set forth below. 

 

I hereby agree not to exercise any of my Covered Options before the Effective
Time. I further agree (a) to accept the Option Termination Consideration for
all of my Covered Options in full satisfaction of all my rights under the
Covered Options, and (b) that, without limitation,

   

subject to receipt of the Option Termination Consideration for the Covered
Options, such Covered Options and the Option Agreements will be cancelled and
will terminate at the Effective Time.

 

I acknowledge that receipt of the Option Termination Consideration is subject
to the satisfaction or fulfillment or waiver of the conditions of closing
contained in the Merger Agreement, and that the Company may collect in cash
(and timely pay) all applicable withholding and payroll taxes with respect to
such options and shall comply with all payroll reporting requirements with
respect thereto. 

 

Upon receipt of any Option Termination Consideration, I hereby release the
Company, Parent and their respective subsidiaries, boards of directors,
agents, attorneys, stockholders, successors and assigns from any and all
obligations to me relating to the Covered Options and the Option Agreements.

 

I expressly acknowledge that this release is intended to include in its
effect, without limitation, all claims relating to the Covered Options and the
Option Agreements that I do not now know or suspect to exist, and that this
Agreement contemplates the extinguishment of any such claim or claims. I
further agree to take such additional actions and deliver such additional
documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Company
and/or Parent to effect the transactions described in this Agreement.

 

I acknowledge that I have had the opportunity to consult with the tax,
financial and legal counsel of my choice regarding execution of this
Agreement, and have done so or knowingly declined to do so, and I am
voluntarily executing this Agreement.

 

This Agreement and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto shall be
governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State
of New York, without regard to its choice of law principles.

 

In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent in
accordance with its terms, this agreement shall automatically terminate and
none of the parties hereto shall have any further liability or obligation to
the other(s) with respect to the subject matter hereof in connection with the
Covered Options.

This Shareholder Agreement, effective as of __________, 2018 (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this "Agreement"), is
entered into by and among RBB Bancorp, a California bank holding company
("Parent"), First American International Corp., a New York bank holding

the Company. Capitalized and other terms used and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement described
below.

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date
hereof, by and between the Company and Parent (as amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), the Company
will be merged with and into Parent, and immediately thereafter, the Company
Bank will merge with and into Parent Bank (the "Merger").

 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent to enter into the Merger
Agreement and consummate the Merger and in consideration of the expenses
incurred and to be incurred by Parent in connection therewith, Parent has
required the Shareholder to execute and deliver this Agreement upon the terms
and conditions set forth herein.

 

WHEREAS, the Shareholder is the registered and beneficial owner of such
number of shares of the outstanding capital stock of the Company as is
indicated on the signature page of this Agreement under the heading "Total
Number of Shares of the Company Common Stock Subject to this Agreement," and
the Shareholder is entitled to dispose of (or to direct the disposition of)
and to vote (or to direct the voting of) such number of shares of the Company
Common Stock indicated on the signature page of this Agreement under the
heading "Total Number of Shares of the Company Common Stock Subject to this
Agreement" (such shares, together with any other shares of Company Common
Stock acquired by the Shareholder after the date hereof and during the term of
this Agreement (including through the exercise of any stock options, warrants
or similar instruments), being collectively referred to herein as the
"Shares").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

 

1.Agreement to Vote Shares.

 

(a)As used herein, the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the earlier to occur
of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof.

   

(b)Until the Expiration Date, at every meeting of the shareholders of the
Company at which the following is considered or voted upon, and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by
written consent of the shareholders of the Company with respect to the
following, the Shareholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) the Shares in
favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the terms thereof and in
favor of each of the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 

(c)Prior to the Expiration Date, the Shareholder will not take any action to
exercise or perfect such Shareholder's right to exercise dissenters' rights in
connection with the Merger or dissent to the Merger, with respect to or in
accordance with the New York Business Corporation Law or otherwise.

 

(d)Shareholder makes no agreement or understanding in this Agreement in
Shareholder\'s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or the Company
Bank, and nothing in this Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions or
omissions taken by Shareholder in Shareholder\'s capacity as such a director
or officer, including in exercising rights under the Merger Agreement, and no
such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or (b)
will be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict Shareholder from exercising
Shareholder\'s fiduciary duties as an officer or director of the Company, the
Company Bank or to its shareholders or as a trustee or fiduciary of any
employee benefit plan or trust of the Company.

 

2.Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Shareholder. Shareholder hereby
represents, warrants and covenants to Parent as follows:

 

(a)Except as otherwise described in Appendix A, (i) the Shareholder is the
record or beneficial owner of, and has good and valid title to, the Shares,
and (ii) the shareholder has the sole right to vote the Shares, with no
restrictions, limitations or qualifications on Shareholder's rights of
disposition pertaining to the Shares, except as provided herein.

 

(b)Other than pursuant to this Agreement or with Parent's prior written
consent, from the date hereof through and including the Expiration Date,
Shareholder shall not (i) sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose
of (including by gift) (collectively, "Transfer"), or enter into any contract,
agreement, option or other arrangement (including any profit sharing
arrangement) with respect to the Transfer of, any Shares to any person (other
than pursuant to the Merger) or (ii) enter into any voting arrangement,
whether by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise, with respect to any Shares
and shall not commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions.
Shareholder shall not, nor shall Shareholder permit any entity under such
Shareholder's control to, deposit any Shares in a voting trust. This Section
2(b) shall not prohibit a Transfer of the Shares by Shareholder to any member
of Shareholder's immediate family, or to a trust for the benefit of
Shareholder or any member of Shareholder's immediate family, or upon the death
of Shareholder, provided, that a Transfer referred to in this paragraph shall
be permitted if, as a precondition to such Transfer, the transferee agrees in
writing to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement.

 

(c)Shareholder has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Shareholder and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Shareholder, enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with
its terms, except as may be limited by (i) the effect of bankruptcy,

   

insolvency, conservatorship, arrangement, moratorium or other laws affecting
or relating to the rights of creditors generally, or (ii) the rules governing
the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies and general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Shareholder does not, and the performance of Shareholder's obligations
hereunder will not, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an
event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under,
or give to others any right to terminate, amend, accelerate or cancel any
right or obligation under, or result in the creation of any lien or
encumbrance on any Shares pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which such Shareholder is a party or by which such Shareholder
or the Shares are or will be bound or affected. If Shareholder is married and
the Shares constitute community property or spousal approval is otherwise
necessary for this Agreement to be legal, valid and binding, this Agreement
has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of, Shareholder's spouse, enforceable in accordance with
its terms.

 

3.Additional Documents. Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees to execute
and deliver any additional documents necessary or desirable, as reasonably
requested by Parent, to carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement.

 

4.Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further force
or effect as of the Expiration Date.

 

5.Miscellaneous.

 

(a)Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

(b)Binding Effect and Assignment. No provision of this Agreement shall be
construed to require a Shareholder, Parent, Parent Bank, the Company, the
Company Bank, or any Subsidiaries, affiliates or directors of any of them to
take any action or omit to take any action which action or omission would
violate applicable law (whether statutory or common law), rule or regulation.
This Agreement is intended to bind each Shareholder solely as a shareholder of
the Company only with respect to the specific matters set forth herein.

 

(c)Amendment and Modification. Any provision of this Agreement may be (i)
waived in whole or in part by the party benefited by the provision or by all
parties or (ii) amended or modified at any time by an agreement in writing
among the parties hereto executed in the same manner as this Agreement.

 

(d)Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties acknowledge that
Parent may be irreparably harmed by, and that there may be no adequate remedy
at law for, a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of Shareholder
set forth in this Agreement. Therefore, Shareholder hereby agrees that, in
addition to any other remedies that may be available

   

to Parent upon any such violation, Parent shall have the right to enforce such
covenants and agreements by specific performance, injunctive relief, or by any
other means available to such party at law or in equity without posting any
bond or other undertaking.

 

(e)Notices. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder to a
party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if personally delivered,
telecopied (with confirmation), e-mailed (with confirmation) or mailed by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) to such party at its
