Assets (as defined below) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, of the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained and of other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_PURCHASE AND SALE OF ASSETS_

Section 1.1 _Purchase and Sale of Assets_

On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer
shall purchase and acquire from Seller, free and clear of all Encumbrances
(other than Permitted Encumbrances), all of Sellers right, title and
interest, as of the Closing, in and to the following assets, properties and
rights that are used in connection with the Business as currently conducted
(collectively, the " _Purchased Assets_ "):

Seller will provide copies of such Business Records to Buyer or shall provide
access to such Business Records at such time and in such manner as Buyer shall
reasonably request from time to time, and no such Business Records shall be
destroyed without providing (or offering to provide) them to Buyer. To
the extent any Business Records are in computer format, Seller will either

within 15 months prior to the  



 

3  Closing Date, as set forth on _Section 1.3(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, which schedule shall be updated by Seller as of the close

updated, shall be delivered by Seller to Buyer on the Closing Date; and

(d) all liabilities and obligations with respect to the operation of the
Business after the Closing, including, but not limited to, merchandise returns
after the Closing.

Section 1.4 _Excluded Liabilities_

Buyer shall not assume, and Seller shall remain obligated to discharge, all
liabilities and obligations of Seller other than the Assumed Liabilities
(collectively, the " _Excluded Liabilities_ ").

Section 1.5 _Purchase Price; Adjustment_

(a) In consideration for the sale by Seller of the Purchased Assets to Buyer
and Buyers assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, at the Closing, Buyer shall
pay to Seller cash in the amount of ONE HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND NO
CENTS ($102,000,000) (as it may be adjusted pursuant to the last sentence
of this _Section 1.5(a)_, _Section 1.5(d)_, and _Section 1.5(i)_, the "
_Purchase Price_ "). The Purchase Price shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated in writing
by Seller at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date. At the
Closing, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to give credit to Buyer for the
amount of liabilities assumed pursuant to _Section 1.3(c). _ 

(b) On a mutually convenient date or dates as near as reasonably practicable
to the Closing Date, but in no event more than five (5) days prior to the
then anticipated Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall cause to be taken a
physical count of the inventory included in the Purchased Assets ("
_Inventory_ ") on a stock keeping unit (" _SKU_ ") basis (the " _Inventory
Count_ "). The Inventory Count shall be taken by RGIS Inventory Services or
such other inventory service designated jointly by Buyer and Seller (the "
_Inventory Service_ ") with Buyer and Seller sharing equally the fees and
expenses of the Inventory Service and Buyer and Seller otherwise each bearing
its own costs and expenses in connection therewith. The Parties shall roll
back or roll forward the Inventory Count, as the case may be, to the close of
business on the day prior to the Closing Date based on Gross Shipments (as
defined below). From the period from the date of the Inventory Count through
the close of business on the day prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall keep
a count of units sold or received by SKU multiplied by the applicable cost,
as truly and accurately recorded in Sellers cost file and records (" _Cost
File_ ") maintained in the ordinary course of business, of such SKUs ("
_Gross Shipments_ "). All such reports shall be made available by Seller to
Buyer on a daily basis from the date of the Inventory Count through the day
prior to the Closing Date.

(c) The Inventory Service shall be additionally instructed by Buyer and Seller
to prepare and deliver to Buyer and Seller a final certified report
of Inventory Count as promptly as practicable following the Inventory Count
and in no event later than two day(s) prior to the Closing Date. Following its
receipt of the final certified report of Inventory Count and no later than the
day prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
and shall deliver to Buyer, an unaudited statement (the " _Closing Statement
of Inventory_ ") setting forth the value of the Inventory as determined by
multiplying the Inventory Count for each SKU by the  



 

4  related cost as set forth in the Cost File as of the close of business on
the day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Closing Inventory Value_ "). Seller
shall deliver to Buyer, together with the Closing Statement of Inventory, the
Cost File utilized in the preparation of the Closing Statement of Inventory.
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with and reasonably assist the Inventory
Service, and shall make available to the Inventory Service the books,
records, personnel and properties of Buyer and Seller, as the case may be,
that the Inventory Service reasonably requires in order to prepare and deliver
the final certified report of Inventory Count.

(d) The Purchase Price at Closing shall be subject to adjustment based upon
the calculation of the Closing Inventory Value as presented by Seller to
Buyer pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)_ on the Closing Date. If, as of the Closing
Date, the difference between the Closing Inventory Value and the Target
Inventory is:

(i) $500,000 or less, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to this _Section 1.5(d)_;

(ii) greater than $500,000, and the Closing Inventory Value is greater than
the Target Inventory, the Purchase Price shall be increased by an
amount equal to such excess, less $500,000; or

(iii) greater than $500,000, and the Closing Inventory Value is less than the
Target Inventory, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to
$500,000 less than such deficiency.

(e) Buyer shall have fifteen (15) days following the delivery of the Closing
Statement of Inventory (the " _Objection Period_ ") to provide written notice
to Seller (the " _Objection Notice_ ") of any good faith objection to any
portion of the Closing Statement of Inventory relating to the final certified
Inventory Count or calculation of the Closing Inventory Value, or adjustment
pursuant to _Section 1.5(d)_ (" _Adjustment_ "), which objection shall be set
forth with reasonable detail in such Objection Notice; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the disputed portions of the Closing Statement of Inventory or
Adjustment are less than $50,000 in the aggregate, then (A) no such Objection
Notice shall be delivered to Seller and (B) the Closing Statement of
Inventory as prepared by Seller shall be deemed final and undisputed. During
the Objection Period, Buyer and its accountants will be permitted to examine
the work papers and all back-up materials and memoranda used or generated by
the Inventory Service and/or Seller in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Statement of Inventory and such other documents as Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with its review of the Closing Statement of
Inventory, and shall be provided access at all reasonable times to the
personnel of the Inventory Service or Seller, as the case may be, for the
purpose of reviewing and ascertaining the accuracy of the Closing Statement of
Inventory or Adjustment. Unless Buyer timely delivers an Objection Notice
before the expiration of the Objection Period, the Closing Statement of
Inventory (and the Closing Inventory Value reflected thereon or calculated
therefrom) and Adjustment shall be deemed to have been accepted and approved
by Buyer and shall thereafter be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller for
purposes of any closing and post-closing adjustment set forth in this _Section
1.5_. In addition, to the extent any portion of the Closing Statement of
Inventory or of the calculation of the Closing Inventory Value or Adjustment
shall not be expressly objected to in the Objection Notice, such matters shall
be deemed to have been accepted and approved by  



 

5  Buyer and shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller for purposes
hereof. If Buyer timely delivers an Objection Notice before the expiration of
the Objection Period, then those aspects of the Closing Statement of
Inventory or Adjustment objected to in the Objection Notice shall not
thereafter be final and binding until resolved in accordance with this
_Section 1.5_.

(f) Following receipt of any Objection Notice, Buyer and Seller shall discuss
in good faith the applicable objections set forth therein for a period of ten
(10) days thereafter and shall, during such period, attempt to resolve the
matter or matters in dispute by mutual written agreement. If Buyer and Seller
reach such an agreement, the agreement shall be confirmed in writing and Buyer
and Seller shall revise the Closing Statement of Inventory to reflect such
agreement, which agreement (and Closing Statement of Inventory, as so revised,
including the Closing Inventory Value reflected thereon or calculated
therefrom and Adjustment) shall thereafter be final and binding upon Seller
and Buyer for purposes of any closing and post-closing adjustment set forth in
this _Section 1.5_.

(g) If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach a mutual agreement in whole or in
part in accordance with _Section 1.5(f)_ during the ten (10)-day period
referred to therein, then Seller and Buyer shall appoint such accounting firm
of national standing designated jointly by Seller and Buyer (other than KPMG
LLP, BDO Seidman, LLP, Ernst and Young or any other accounting firm that has
performed significant work for any Party or any of its Affiliates since
January 1, 2007) (the " _Accounting Firm_ "), which shall resolve those
matters still in dispute with respect to the Closing Statement of Inventory
and the Closing Inventory Value reflected thereon or calculated therefrom
or Adjustment. Not later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the tenth
(10th) full Business Day after the day on which the Accounting Firm is
appointed, Seller and Buyer each shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Accounting Firm: (i) a written statement of its position on each remaining
dispute or disagreement (that Partys " _Position_ "); (ii) the aggregate
Closing Inventory Value and Adjustment, determined as though the Accounting
Firm concurred with each such position (that Partys " _Final Number_ "); and
(iii) a wire transfer or certified check in the amount of $10,000, which
amount the Accounting Firm shall be authorized to apply towards its fees
and expenses in the manner set forth below. If one Party fully complies with
the immediately preceding sentence and the other Party does not, the compliant
Partys Position shall be final and binding on all Parties and no further
action by the Accounting Firm is required. If both Parties comply with the
second sentence of this _Section 1.5(g)_, the Accounting Firm shall make a
final and binding resolution of the remaining disputes or disagreements
between Buyer and Seller, and at such time the Party (if any) liable for any
further payment of the Adjustment shall comply with the provisions of _Section
1.5(i)_ hereof. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed that, in making its
final and binding resolution, it must, as to each disputed item, select
either the Position of Buyer or the Position of Seller. No appeal from such
determination shall be permitted. The costs and expenses for the services of
the Accounting Firm shall be borne entirely by the Party whose Final Number
is furthest (in dollars) from the appropriate Adjustment as determined by the
Accounting Firm. Subject to the foregoing sentence and _Section 1.5(b)_, all
fees and expenses of Seller relating to matters described in this  _Section
1.5_ shall be borne by Seller, and all fees and expenses of Buyer relating to
matters described in this _Section 1.5_ shall be borne by Buyer. Seller and
Buyer agree to fully cooperate with each other and with the Accounting Firm
to resolve any dispute.



 

6 (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, any provision stating that remedies shall be cumulative and not
exclusive, this _Section 1.5_ provides the sole and exclusive method for
resolving any and all disputes that may arise between or among the Parties
with respect to the determination of Closing Inventory Value and Adjustment.
As among the Parties, each Party hereby irrevocably waives, relinquishes and
surrenders on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its officers,
directors, principals, attorneys, agents, employees and other authorized
representatives (each a " _Representative_ ") all rights to, and agrees that
it will not attempt, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to
attempt, to resolve any such dispute or disputes related to the determination
of the Closing Statement of Inventory or Adjustment in any manner other than
as set forth in this _Section 1.5_, including, without limitation, through
litigation. Each Party further agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates and Representatives that if one or more of them should initiate any
attempt to resolve any such dispute or disputes related to the determination
of the Closing Statement of Inventory or Adjustment in any manner other than
the sole and exclusive manner set forth in this _Section 1.5_, such
initiators shall pay and reimburse all fees, costs and expenses incurred by
any other Party as a result of, in connection with or related to such attempt
or attempts.

 

(i) All payments required to be made to a Party as a result of the final
determination of the Adjustment pursuant to this _Section 1.5_ shall be
made, in immediately available funds via wire transfer to the account or
accounts designated in writing by the Party entitled to receive such payment,
no later than two Business Days following the final calculation of the Closing
Inventory Value and Adjustment. Any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to this _Section 1.5_ shall be treated by all parties hereto for Tax
purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

Upon reasonable prior notice, Seller shall afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other agents and representatives of Buyer reasonable
access at reasonable times, during the period prior to the Closing Date or the
earlier termination of this Agreement, to all of Sellers properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records. In addition, during such period, Seller
shall furnish to Buyer all information concerning the Business and Sellers
properties and personnel as Buyer may reasonably request, and shall make
available to Buyer the appropriate individuals (including attorneys,
accountants and other professionals) for discussion of the Business and
Sellers properties and personnel as Buyer may reasonably request. All such
information shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the
confidentiality agreement dated April 18, 2008 between dELiA*s and Buyer (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
review, inquiry or investigation shall affect any representations or
warranties of any Parties herein or the conditions to the obligations of any
Parties.

Section 6.2 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the Parties
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the Transactions and to vest in Buyer good and marketable title to
the Conveyed Intellectual Property, including obtaining all consents,
waivers, authorizations and approvals from Governmental Authorities and other
third parties required for the consummation of the Transactions.

(b) From time to time after the Closing, at the request of Buyer and without
further consideration, Seller agrees on its own behalf, as well as on
behalf of its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns and
legal representatives, to execute and deliver, and to use reasonable
commercial efforts to cause Alloy to execute and deliver, to Buyer any further
documents or instruments and perform any further acts that may reasonably be
deemed necessary or desirable by Buyer to vest, record, perfect, support
and/or confirm the rights herein conveyed, or intended so to be, with respect
to the Conveyed Intellectual Property, including without limitation such
assignments, agreements and limited powers of attorney as may be needed for
recording or effectuating the transfer of the Conveyed Intellectual Property
in the United States of America. Nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by
Buyer of its right to receive at the Closing an effective assignment of such
rights by Seller as otherwise set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Seller and dELiA*s shall, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Alloy to, execute and deliver to
Buyer or obtain for delivery to Buyer, at the request of Buyer and without
further consideration, any documents required to update record title to the
Conveyed Intellectual Property to reflect Buyer as the record owner in each
U.S. jurisdiction in which such Conveyed Intellectual Property exists. At the
request of Buyer, and at its reasonable expense, and without further
consideration, Seller and  



 

21  dELiA*s shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Alloy
to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection with the registration of

States of America, including delivering such letters of instruction to foreign
associate counsel, as may be needed for Buyer to assume responsibility
therefor.

(c) From time to time after the Closing, at the request of Buyer and at its
expense, and without further consideration, Seller and dELiA*s shall,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Alloy to, assist Buyer
as Buyer may reasonably require in connection with the defense or prosecution
of any claim by or against any third party with respect to the ownership,
validity, enforceability, infringement or other violation of or by the
Conveyed Intellectual Property.

Section 6.3 _Public Announcements_  

Each of the Parties agrees that no press release or announcement concerning
this Agreement or the Transactions shall be issued by it or any of its
Affiliates without the prior consent of the other Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
any securities exchange, in which case such Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

Section 6.4 _Government Compliance_

As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement,
each of Seller and Buyer shall file, or caused to be filed, with the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the
U.S. Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") Notification and Report Forms
relating to the Transactions as required by the HSR Act, and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an early termination of any
applicable waiting period thereunder. Each of Seller and Buyer shall promptly
(i) supply the other Party with any information which may be required in order
to effectuate such filings and (ii) supply any additional information which
may be required by the FTC or the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority in
connection with such filings. Each of Seller and Buyer will notify the other
Party promptly upon the receipt of (i) any comments from any officials of the
FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority in connection with such
filings and (ii) any request by any officials of the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Authority for amendments or supplements to such filings or
information provided to comply with the requirements of the HSR Act. Whenever
any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any filing made pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, each of Seller
and Buyer will promptly inform the other Party of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Authority such amendment
or supplement. The Parties will consult and cooperate with each other, and
consider in good faith the views of each other, in connection with, and
provide to the other Partys counsel in advance, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection with any Action under
or relating to the HSR Act. The Parties may designate any such documents
"outside counsel only" and, if so designated, such documents may not be
disclosed to the other Party.



 

22 Section 6.5 _Benefit Plans and Employee Matters_

(a) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, effective as of the
Closing Date, the Seller Employees shall cease to be covered as
active participants by the Seller Employee Plans. Prior to the Closing, Buyer
or its Affiliate shall offer employment effective as of the Closing Date to
all persons employed by Seller as of the date hereof, at no less than the same
level of base salary provided to each such person immediately prior to the
Closing, and each such employee of Seller who accepts Buyers or its
Affiliates offer of employment is hereinafter referred to as a " _Transferred
Employee_."

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliate shall cause each
Transferred Employee who was covered under any Seller Employee
Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date to be covered under employee
benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained by Buyer or its Affiliate
(" _Buyer Plans_ "), in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Buyer
Plans. Buyer or its Affiliate shall recognize each Transferred Employees
prior service that is recognized under the Seller Employee Plans for
eligibility and vesting purposes and, in the case of vacation and severance
benefits, for purposes of determining the amount of benefits; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such prior service recognition shall not operate to duplicate
any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.

(c) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Buyer or its Affiliate (" _Buyer
Welfare Benefit Plans_ ") in which a Transferred Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Affiliate to waive, or cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations
as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Transferred
Employee under any Buyer Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under
a comparable Seller Employee Plan, if any.

(d) Seller will provide the required notices under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA
(" _COBRA_ ") to all MandA Qualified Beneficiaries (as defined in Treas. Reg.
Section 54.4980B-9, QandA 4) and will provide coverage under COBRA to such
individuals.

(e) In the event the Closing Date does not occur on the first day of a month,
Seller will continue to offer medical, prescription drug, and dental benefits
to the Transferred Employees who are enrolled in the Seller Employee Plans
through the end of the month in which the Closing Date occurs. Effective as of
the Closing Date, any Transferred Employee who participated in dELiA*s health
flexible spending account plan will be considered to be a participant in the
Buyers or its Affiliates health flexible spending account plan, at the level
of coverage previously elected by such Transferred Employee, and health care
expenses incurred by such Transferred Employee at any time after  ~~during
2008 (including claims prior to~~ the Closing Date ~~)~~ shall be reimbursed
(up to the amount of the Transferred Employees previous deferral election and
reduced by amounts previously reimbursed by dELiA*s), as provided in
_Schedule 6.5(e)_ hereto.



 

23 (f) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliate shall take all
reasonable and customary action necessary or appropriate to cause Buyers or
its Affiliates 401(k) Plan to recognize prior service with Seller for
purposes of vesting and participation. Seller shall cause the account balances
of the Transferred Employees under dELiA*s 401(k) Plan to be fully vested as
of the Closing Date. Seller or dELiA*s shall permit Transferred Employees to
make a "direct rollover" of such Transferred Employees account balances
(including loans to Transferred Employees) under dELiA*s 401(k) Plan to
Buyers or its Affiliates 401(k) Plan. Seller acknowledges that on and after
the Closing Date, the account balances of Transferred Employees held in
dELiA*s 401(k) Plan will be distributable from dELiA*s 401(k) Plan in
accordance with the Code. Neither Seller nor dELiA*s shall place any
Transferred Employees plan loan in default or declare a default with respect
to any outstanding plan loan during the ninety (90)-day period following the
Closing Date or such shorter period requested by Buyer, so long as such
Transferred Employee continues to make loan repayments when due and such
Transferred Employee transfers his or her account balance under dELiA*s
401(k) Plan, together with the promissory note evidencing the plan loan, to
the Buyers or its Affiliates 401(k) Plan through a "direct rollover" on or
as soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date.

Section 6.6 _Transfer Taxes_

Buyer shall pay, when due, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the consummation of any of the Transactions and
shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Returns and other documentation
with respect to such Taxes, fees and charges. Seller and dELiA*s shall
cooperate with Buyer in the preparation and execution of these Returns, or
other documentation.

Section 6.7 _Bulk Sales Laws_

The Parties agree to waive compliance with any applicable bulk sales Laws or
other similar Laws.

that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall

(c) by either Seller or Buyer if any Governmental Authority shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or Order that is, in

or warranty of Seller shall have become inaccurate, in either case that would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or 
_7.2(b)_ (a " _Terminating Seller Breach_ "); _provided_ that if such
Terminating Seller Breach is reasonably curable by Seller, within 30 days
after Seller has received written notice from Buyer of such Terminating

and for as long as Seller continues to exercise such commercially reasonable
efforts, Buyer may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(d)_
until the earlier of the expiration of such 30-day period and the Outside

(e) by Seller (if Seller is not in material breach of any of

27 ARTICLE IX

_INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS_

Section 9.1 _Seller s Indemnification Obligation_ 

Seller agrees that, from and after the Closing, it shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer, its officers, directors, Affiliates, partners, members,
managers, employees, agents and other representatives from and against any
damages, claims, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees) (each, a " _Liability_ " and,
collectively, " _Liabilities_ ") incurred by any of the foregoing Persons
arising out of (a) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty
of Seller contained in _Article II_ of this Agreement, (b) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement, (c) any of the
Excluded Liabilities, (d) the operation of the Business prior to the Closing
or (e) non-compliance with bulk sales Laws or similar Laws.

Section 9.2 _Buyer s Indemnification Obligation_

Buyer agrees that, from and after the Closing, it shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller, its officers, directors, Affiliates, partners, members,
managers, employees, agents and other representatives from and against any
Liabilities incurred by any of the foregoing Persons arising out of (a) any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in 
_Article III_ of this Agreement, (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement
of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (c) any of the Assumed Liabilities or
(d) the operation of the Business from and after the Closing.

Section 9.3 _Procedures for Indemnification for Third Party Claims_

For purposes of this _Article IX_ , any Party entitled to be indemnified under
_Article IX_ is referred to herein as an " _Indemnified Party_ ," and any
Party obligated to provide indemnification under _Article IX_ is referred to
herein as an " _Indemnifying Party_." The obligations and liabilities of the
Parties under this _Article IX_ with respect to, relating to or arising out of
claims of third parties (individually, a " _Third Party Claim_ " and,
collectively, the " _Third Party Claims_ ") shall be subject to the following
terms and conditions:

(a) The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice of any Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party may undertake the
defense of that claim by representatives chosen by it and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, _provided_ that, in such event, the
Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in such defense through
counsel of its own choice and at its own expense. Any such notice of a
Third Party Claim shall identify with reasonable specificity the basis for
the Third Party Claim, the facts giving rise to the Third Party Claim and the
amount of the Third Party Claim (or, if such amount is not yet known, a
reasonable estimate of the amount of the Third Party Claim). The  



 

28  Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party copies of
all relevant documents and records in its possession. Failure of an
Indemnified Party to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligation to indemnify, except to the extent that the failure to
so notify materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
such claim against a third party.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party, within 20 days after notice from the
Indemnified Party of any such Third Party Claim, notifies the Indemnified
Party in writing of its election not to, or fails to, assume the defense
thereof in accordance with _Section 9.3(a)_ of this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right (but not the obligation) to undertake
the defense of the Third Party Claim. Any failure on the part of the
Indemnifying Party to notify the Indemnified Party within the time period
provided above regarding its election shall be deemed an election by the
Indemnifying Party not to assume and control the defense of the Third Party
Claim.

(c) Anything in this _Section 9.3_ to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to
the entry of judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of an
unconditional release from all liability in respect of the Third Party Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall not, without the prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Indemnifying Party,
settle, compromise or pay any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of
judgment with respect thereto.

Section 9.4 _Indemnification Limitations_

(a) _Deductibles_. No indemnification under  _Section 9.1(a)_ shall be
required, unless the aggregate amount of Liabilities incurred under _Section
9.1(a)_ exceeds $350,000 (the " _Aggregate Threshold Amount_ "), in which case
Sellers indemnification obligation shall only extend to the amount of such
Liabilities in excess of the Aggregate Threshold Amount.

(b) _Overall Limitation_. In no event whatsoever shall Sellers maximum
liability with respect to Liabilities under _Section 9.1_ exceed in the
aggregate $10,750,000.

(c) _Time Limits On Indemnification_. No claim on account of a breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty shall be made after the expiration
of the survival periods referred to in  _Section 10.1_ of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a written claim or written notice is given
under _Article IX_ with respect to any representation or warranty prior to the
expiration of its survival period, the claim with respect to such
representation or warranty shall continue until such claim is finally
resolved.

(d) _Net Recovery_. The amount which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to receive from an Indemnifying Party under this _Article IX_ with respect to
any indemnifiable Liability shall be net of any recovery actually received by
such Indemnified Party from unaffiliated third parties (including insurance
proceeds (except from self-insurance programs), counterclaims, subrogation
actions, warranties and indemnification from, and other claims against, third
parties and the like).



 

29 (e) _Damage Limitation_. An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to
indemnification for consequential, punitive, indirect, incidental,
speculative or special damages or lost profits, except in the event of fraud.

(f) _Waiver of Conditions_. The right of an Indemnified Party to
indemnification hereunder shall not be affected by any investigation conducted
with respect to the accuracy of or compliance with any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the waiver of any condition based on the
