12 ARTICLE II

PURCHASE AND SALE



2.1 _Sale and Delivery of Membership Interests_. On the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, Seller shall, at the Closing on the Closing
Date, sell and transfer to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and accept
from Seller, all of the Membership Interests.



2.2 _Payment of Estimated Purchase Price_. Not less than two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser its good faith
estimate of the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value of the Company (the
"Estimated Closing Date Adjusted Book Value"). On the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and against transfer of the Membership
Interests as provided in Section 2.1 and the other deliveries of Seller set
forth in Section 3.2, Purchaser shall pay, at the Closing on the Closing
Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as Seller shall designate in writing to Purchaser not less than one
Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Estimated Purchase Price and shall
make the other deliveries set forth in Section 3.3.



2.3  _Purchase Price Adjustment_.



(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare an
unaudited statement of financial condition of the Company as of the Closing
Date, after giving effect to the Reorganization on a pro forma basis,
completed in accordance with Section 6.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
and a calculation of the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value (collectively, the "
_Closing Date Adjusted Balance Sheet_ "). The Closing Date Adjusted Balance
Sheet shall be prepared in the same manner and using the same accounting
policies, principles, bases, methods and calculation principles as used in the
preparation of the June Adjusted Balance Sheet, as set forth in Section 2.3(a)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, except as otherwise stated in Section
2.3(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Seller shall provide such assistance
and cooperation to Purchaser in the preparation of the Closing Date Adjusted
Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value set
forth therein as Purchaser may reasonably request.



(b) Following the delivery by Purchaser to Seller of the Closing Date
Adjusted Balance Sheet, Seller shall have a period of 30 days in which to
review the Closing Date Adjusted Balance Sheet and the calculation of the
Closing Date Adjusted Book Value. Seller and its accountants shall be
provided with reasonable access to the work papers of Purchaser and its
accountants in connection with such review. In the event that Seller
determines that the Closing Date Adjusted Balance Sheet and/or
the calculation of Closing Date Adjusted Book Value have not been prepared on
a basis consistent with the requirements of Section 2.3(a) (including the
defined terms used therein), Seller shall, on or before the last day of such
30-day period, inform Purchaser in writing of such determination (the "
_Objection_ "), setting forth in reasonable detail a specific description of
the basis of the Objection, the adjustments to the Closing Date Adjusted
Balance Sheet and/or the calculation of Closing Date Adjusted Book Value that
Seller believes should be made, and, if different from Purchasers calculation
thereof, Sellers calculation of the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value. Seller
shall be deemed to have accepted any items not specifically disputed in the
Objection. Failure to so notify Purchaser  



 

13  shall constitute acceptance and approval of Purchasers preparation of the
Closing Date Adjusted Balance Sheet and calculation of the Closing
Date Adjusted Book Value.



(c) Purchaser shall then have 30 days following the date it receives the
Objection to review and respond to the Objection, during which period Seller
and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the Objection. If
Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with
respect to the determination of the foregoing items by the 30th day following
the date on which Purchaser receives the Objection, after having used their
good faith efforts to reach a resolution, they shall refer their
remaining differences to KPMG LLP (or if they are unable or unwilling to
serve, a firm of accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser) (the " _CPA Firm_ "), who shall, acting
as experts in accounting and not as arbitrators, determine on a basis
consistent with the requirements of Section 2.3(a) (including the defined
terms used therein), and only with respect to the specific remaining
accounting-related differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if
any, the Closing Date Adjusted Balance Sheet and/or the calculation of the
Closing Date Adjusted Book Value requires adjustment. Seller and Purchaser
shall request the CPA Firm to use its reasonable best efforts to render its
determination within 45 days following submission of such matters to the CPA
Firm. The CPA Firms determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
parties hereto. Seller and Purchaser shall make reasonably available to the
CPA Firm all relevant books and records, and (subject to the execution of
customary access agreements) work papers (including those of the parties
respective accountants, to the extent applicable) and supporting documentation
relating to the Closing Date Adjusted Balance Sheet and/or the calculation of
the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value and all other items reasonably requested
by the CPA Firm. The " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall mean the Closing Date
Adjusted Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Date Adjusted Book
Value (i) as submitted by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.3(a) in the event
that (A) no Objection is delivered to Seller during the initial 30 day
period specified above or (B) Seller and Purchaser so agree, (ii) as adjusted
in accordance with the Objection, in the event that (A) Purchaser does not
respond to the Objection during the 30 day period specified above following
receipt by Seller of the Objection or (B) Seller and Purchaser so agree,
(iii) as adjusted in accordance with the agreement of Seller and Purchaser, if
Seller and Purchaser so agree during the 30 day period following receipt by
Purchaser of the Objection, or (iv) as adjusted by the CPA Firm, if it has
been submitted to the CPA Firm for review, together with any other
modifications to the Closing Date Adjusted Balance Sheet and/or the
calculation of Closing Date Adjusted Book Value agreed upon by Seller and
Purchaser. All fees and expenses of the CPA Firm shall be shared equally by
Seller and Purchaser.



(d) If the Adjusted Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the sum of (i) the
amount by which the Adjusted Purchase Price is less than the Estimated
Purchase Price, plus (ii) interest payable on the amount paid under clause
(i), computed at the rate declared from time to time by Seller Parent as
its "base rate" (based on a 365-day year) (the " _Prime Rate_ ") for the
period from the Closing Date to the date of such payment, in immediately
available funds no later than the third Business Day following the date on
which the Final Closing Statement is determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c)
above. If the Adjusted Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase
Price, Purchaser shall pay Seller an amount in cash equal to the sum of (x)
the excess of the Adjusted Purchase Price over the Estimated Purchase Price,
as set forth in the Final Closing Statement, plus (y) interest payable on the
amount paid under clause (x), computed at the Prime



 

14 Rate for the period from the Closing Date to the date of such payment, in
immediately available funds no later than the third Business Day following
the date on which the Final Closing Statement is determined pursuant to
Section 2.3(c) above. The Purchase Price shall be deemed to be reduced by any
payment to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) and increased by any
payment to Seller pursuant to this Section 2.3(d).



2.4 _Purchase Price Allocation_.



(a) Within 180 days after the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to
Seller a draft of a statement (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") setting forth
its proposed calculation of the aggregate amount of the Purchase Price to be
allocated among the assets of the Company and the proposed allocation of such
aggregate amount among such assets. If within 30 days after Sellers receipt
of the draft Allocation Statement, Seller shall not have objected in writing
to such draft Allocation Statement, the draft Allocation Statement shall
become the Allocation Statement. In the event that Seller objects in writing
within such 30-day period, Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve the dispute. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach an
agreement within 30 days after Purchasers receipt of Sellers written
objection, the dispute shall be resolved and the Allocation Statement shall
be determined by an independent, nationally recognized firm of accountants
mutually selected by the parties. The Allocation Statement, as agreed upon by
Purchaser and Seller and/or determined under this Section, shall be final and
binding upon the parties. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall bear all fees and
costs incurred by it in connection with the determination of the Allocation
Statement, except that the parties shall each pay one-half (50%) of the fees
and expenses of any accounting firm retained to resolve the allocation
dispute.



(b) The Allocation Statement will be prepared in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;  _provided_
that no amount shall be allocated to any non-compete, non-hire, or non-
solicitation covenant or agreement.



(c) The parties hereto agree to report the allocation of the total
consideration among the assets of the Company in a manner consistent with
the Allocation Statement and agree to act in accordance with the Allocation
Statement in the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns (including filing
Form 8594 with their respective Federal income tax returns for the taxable
year that includes the Closing Date and any other forms or statements
required by the Code, treasury regulations, the Internal Revenue Service or
any applicable state or local taxing authority) and in the course of any Tax
audit, Tax review or Tax litigation relating thereto; _provided_ that neither
Seller or any of its Affiliates nor Purchaser or any of its Affiliates will be
obligated to litigate any challenge to such allocation of the Purchase Price
by a taxing authority.



(d) The parties will promptly inform one another of any challenge by
any taxing authority to any allocation made pursuant to this Section and
agree to consult and keep one another informed with respect to the status of,
and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, such challenge.

the Companys employees who are required to be licensed or registered to
conduct the business of the Company are duly licensed or registered in each
state and with each Governmental Authority in which or with which such
licensing or registration is so required. 



(g) Except as disclosed on Form BD filed prior to the date of this Agreement
or as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
neither the Company nor any of its directors, officers, employees or
"associated persons" (as defined in the Exchange Act) has been the subject of
any disciplinary proceedings or orders of any Governmental Authority arising
under applicable laws which would be required to be disclosed on Form BD.
Except as set forth in Section 4.8(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no

Seller, threatened. Except as disclosed on a Form BD filed prior to the date

plan, and any other stock based plan program or policy sponsored by the

otherwise set forth in Section 4.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
Seller has made available to Purchaser a true and complete copy of each such
Benefit Plan document, policy or summary plan description thereof.



(b) The Benefit Plans are in compliance with all applicable requirements of
ERISA, the Code, and other Applicable Laws and have been administered in
accordance with their terms and such laws, except where the failure to so
comply or administer would not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified within the meaning
of Section 401 of the Code has received a favorable determination letter as to
its qualification, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, nothing has occurred that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification, except
where such lack of qualification would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

Adverse Effect.



(e) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
with respect to any multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA) to which the Company or any member of its "Controlled
Group" (defined as any organization which is a member of a controlled group of
organizations within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code) has any liability or contributes (or has at any time contributed or had
an obligation to contribute): none of the Company or any member of its
Controlled Group (i) has incurred any withdrawal liability under Title IV of
ERISA which remains unsatisfied that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) would be subject to withdrawal liability that
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect if, as of the
Closing Date, the Company or any member of its Controlled Group were to engage
in a  



 

21  complete withdrawal (as defined in Section 4203 of ERISA) or partial
withdrawal (as defined in Section 4205 of ERISA) from any such
multiemployer plan.



(f) Except as expressly provided in Section 7.6, no Plan is or will be
directly or indirectly binding on Purchaser by virtue of the transaction
contemplated hereby. Purchaser, its Subsidiaries, and its Affiliates
(including without limitation, on and after the Closing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries) shall have no liability for, under, with respect to or
otherwise in connection with any Plan, which liability arises under ERISA or
the Code, by virtue of the Company or any Subsidiary being aggregated, with
any other person that is an ERISA Affiliate (other than with the Company or
its Subsidiary), in a controlled group or affiliated service group for
purposes of ERISA or the Code at any relevant time prior to the Closing.



4.11 _Taxes._



(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (i) Seller has filed or caused
to be filed, or will file or cause to be filed, on or prior to the Closing
Date, all Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to the Company, other
than with respect to Transfer Taxes as provided for in Section 10.1(d)
hereof; (ii) all Taxes, whether or not shown as due on such Tax Returns, have
been timely paid or provided for on the Companys books, and all such Tax
Returns are true and complete in all material respects; (iii) except as set
forth in Section 4.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no
pending or (to the best knowledge of Seller) threatened actions or proceedings
for the assessment or collection of any Taxes against the Seller or the
Company; and (iv) with respect to any period for which Tax Returns have not
yet been filed or for which Taxes are not yet due and owing, the Seller and
the Company have made due and sufficient accruals in accordance with U.S.
GAAP.



(b) The Company has not taken part in any "listed transaction" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(c)(3)(i)(A) or any comparable
statute or regulation in any jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to
Tax. Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, the Company has
complied in all material respects with all applicable laws related to the
withholding and payment of Taxes. Except insofar as would not be material, the
Company, or the Seller on the Companys behalf, has timely and properly
issued to all of the Companys employees, independent contractors, officers,
directors and customers all of the annual information returns and statements,
including but not limited to IRS Forms W-2, 1099-MISC, 1099-B, 1099-INT,
1099-DIV and 1042-S that are required by law to be issued to such parties.



(c) Section 4.11(c) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) all material
types of Taxes paid and all types of material Tax Returns filed by or on
behalf of the Company and (ii) all jurisdictions in which such Taxes are paid
or such Tax Returns are filed. No claim has been made by a Taxing Authority in
a jurisdiction in which neither the Seller nor the Company files Tax Returns
that the Company may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither the
Seller nor the Company has ever elected to treat the Company as a corporation
for tax purposes under Treasury Regulation §301.7701-3 for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. Accordingly the Company has at all times for U.S. federal
income tax purposes been an entity disregarded as separate from the Seller for
all Taxes affected by the entity classification under such Regulation, and the
Seller and the Company have paid all Taxes and filed all Tax
Returns consistent with the classification as a disregarded entity.



 

22 4.12 _Properties_. The Company is the lessee of the Leased Premises and Seller
has made available to Purchaser a true and complete copy of the Company
Office Lease. The Company is not in default under the terms of the Company
Office Lease. The Company does not own any real properties in fee simple nor
is it a lessee or sub-lessee of any other real property other than the Leased
Premises.

bargaining agreement. To the Knowledge of Seller, there are no labor
controversies pending against the Company which would reasonably be expected

of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of each
Material Contract in effect on the date of this Agreement, a copy of each of

or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
each Material Contract is a legal and binding obligation of the Company and,
to the Knowledge of Seller, each of the other parties thereto, in each
case enforceable against the Company and, to the Knowledge of Seller, the
other parties thereto, in accordance with its terms, except as may be affected
by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium
and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally
or general equitable principles. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no
condition exists or event has occurred which (whether with or without the
giving of notice or lapse of time) would constitute a default by the Company
or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any other party thereto under, or result in a
right of termination of, any Material Contract.

 



(b) Section 4.14(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all written
Contracts in effect on the date hereof between the Company and any Affiliate
of the Company, other than any Contracts (i) involving aggregate annual
payments by or to the Company not in excess of $100,000 in the case of any
individual Contract or (ii) which will be terminated at or prior to the
Closing.



4.15 _Intellectual Property_. Except as set forth in Section 4.15 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, as contemplated by Section 6.7, or as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (a) the Company,

right to use all the Intellectual Property used by the Company in the Business
as currently conducted and (b) to the Knowledge of Seller, (i) such

violate the Intellectual Property of any other Person.

Seller Disclosure Schedule or as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:



(a) the Company is in compliance with all Environmental Laws;



(b) the Company has not received any Environmental Claim nor, to the Knowledge
of Seller, is there any threatened Environmental Claim; and



(c) Hazardous Materials have not been "released" (within the meaning of 42
U.S.C. Section 9601(22)) by the Company in violation of any Environmental
Laws.



4.17 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
Person, other than J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., the fees and expenses
of which will be paid by Seller Parent, is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates.



4.18 _Sufficiency of Assets and Services_. The Company owns, leases or has
the legal right to use (including by contractual arrangement with Affiliates
of the Company as of the date hereof and as of the Closing by way of one or
more of the Ancillary Agreements and giving effect to the Reorganization) all
assets, services and properties necessary for the conduct of the Business in
all material respects as currently conducted.



4.19 _Books and Records_. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the
books and records of the Company are being maintained in all material respects
in accordance with the applicable rules of all applicable Governmental
Authorities. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, since January 1, 2004, the Company has devised and maintained
systems of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that (a) all material transactions are executed in accordance
with managements general or specific authorization and (b) all material
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP consistently applied.



4.20 _No Other Representations_. (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Article IV or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser understands and agrees that Seller and Seller Parent have not made,
and are not making, any representation or warranty whatsoever, express or
implied, with respect to Seller, its Affiliates, the Company, the Business,
the transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter, other than those
representations and warranties of Seller and Seller Parent expressly set forth
in this Article IV. 



(b) Purchaser acknowledges that it has been given such access to the
premises, books, records and officers of the Company and have had the
opportunity to review such other data and other information with respect to
the Company and the Business as Purchaser has deemed necessary in their sole
judgment to evaluate the transactions with Seller and Seller Parent
contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges that neither Seller or
Seller Parent nor any of their respective officers, directors, Affiliates,

parties to this Agreement shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or
cause to be taken all actions and promptly to do or cause to be done all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and in
any event on or prior to December 31, 2005.



 

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement shall (i) (A) as soon as practicable
after the date hereof, and with respect to the initial filing required to be
made pursuant to the HSR Act and any filings to be made with the New York
Stock Exchange or the NASD, not later than the 15th day following the date
hereof, file such applications, notices, registrations and requests as may
be required or advisable to be filed by it with any Governmental Authority in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents, authorizations, orders and
approvals of all such Governmental Authorities referred to in the preceding
clause (A) as soon as practicable after the date hereof, and (C) use its  



 

29 reasonable best efforts to satisfy all conditions, undertakings and
requirements as may be necessary or appropriate to obtain all such consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals or as may be set forth therein, (ii)
furnish the other parties hereto with copies of all documents (except
documents or portions thereof relating to matters not relating to the Company
or the transactions contemplated hereby and for which confidential treatment
has been requested or given) and correspondence (A) prepared by or on behalf
of such party for submission to any Governmental Authority and (B)
received by or on behalf of such party from any Governmental Authority, in
each case in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii)
use its reasonable best efforts to consult with and keep the other parties
hereto informed as to the status of such matters. To the extent that any
application, notice, registration or request so filed by any party contains
any significant information relating to the other parties hereto, prior to
submitting such application, notice, registration or request to any
Governmental Authority, such party will permit the other parties to review
such information and will consider in good faith the suggestions of such other
parties with respect thereto. Without limiting the scope or effect of
the foregoing, Purchaser shall use all reasonable efforts to take any and all
of the following actions to the extent necessary to obtain the approvals of
all Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (and Seller and Seller Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser in the taking of such actions):
(i) entering into negotiations with such Governmental Authorities, (ii)
providing information required by Applicable Law or duly requested by such
Governmental Authorities, (iii) complying with any "second request" for
information or similar action by any Governmental Authority, and (iv) taking
all appropriate action to defend any litigation or administrative proceeding
seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining
order or other order or decree preventing or impairing the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither Seller Parent and Seller nor Purchaser, nor
any of their respective Affiliates, shall be under any obligation to make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for
a Divestiture. " _Divestiture_ " shall mean (A) the sale, license or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any material assets or categories of assets of Seller, Seller
Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, (B) the imposition of any material limitation or restriction on
the ability of Seller, Seller Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to freely conduct their business
or own such assets, or (C) the holding separate of the Membership Interests or
any limitation or regulation on the ability of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the Membership Interests.



(c) Each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with the other parties hereto in the preparation and
filing of any applications, notices, registrations and responses to requests
for additional information from Governmental Authorities in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including providing such
information as may be reasonably necessary for inclusion in such
applications, notices, registrations and responses.



(d) To the extent that any Third Party Consent is required under any Contract
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Seller and Seller Parent will use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
such Third Party Consent on or prior to the



 

30 Closing Date. Upon the request of Seller, Purchaser will provide reasonable
assistance to Seller and Seller Parent in obtaining such Third Party
Consents, including providing such financial and other information as may be
reasonably requested by the other parties to such Contracts. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither Seller or Seller Parent nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any obligation to pay any money or other consideration
to any Person or to initiate any claim or proceeding against any Person in
order to obtain any such Third Party Consent. Purchaser shall remain obligated
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the
other terms and conditions hereof, whether or not all such Third Party
Consents are obtained on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller and Purchaser
agree that, in the event any such assignment cannot be obtained prior to
Closing, Seller and its applicable Affiliate (including prior to the Closing,
the Company), on the one hand, and Purchaser and, following the Closing, the
Company, on the other hand, will cooperate with each other in attempting to
obtain such consent as promptly as practical following Closing. Unless and
until such Third Party Consent is obtained, Seller shall, or shall cause its
applicable Affiliate to use its reasonable best efforts to, provide the
Company with the rights and benefits of the affected Contract, in which case
the Company shall assume the obligations and burdens thereunder.



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
contact any customers of the Seller and its Affiliates (including the
Company) without the prior written consent of Seller.



(f) Prior to the Closing Parent will not modify, waive or amend any condition
of funding set forth in the Financing Commitment and will not make any
other modification to the terms of the Financing Commitment that would, in
the reasonable judgment of Seller Parent, adversely affect the interests of
Seller or Seller Parent, without Seller Parents prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.



(g) At Purchasers request, Seller Parent and Seller shall provide or cause
to be provided all documents and information (as reasonably available and
accessible), and access to personnel and other assistance and cooperation to
Purchaser, in any event as may be reasonably necessary for it to secure the
financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment, including, but not limited
to, (i) reasonably assisting Purchaser in its preparation of a prospectus or
offering memorandum relating to the sale of the securities contemplated by
the Financing Commitment, including providing such financial statements and
other financial information for inclusion therein as Purchaser may reasonably
request and which Seller, Seller Parent or the Company currently have or
can prepare without unreasonable expense or effort, (ii) using reasonable
best efforts to secure, at Purchasers expense, all consents and "comfort"
letters from Seller Parents, Sellers or the Companys
independent accountants as may be reasonably necessary in connection with the
offering of those securities, and (iii) making senior management of the
Company reasonably available to participate in a "road show" and other
customary marketing efforts in relation to the sale of those securities to
prospective investors.



6.4 _Insurance; Risk of Loss_. (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, (i)
Seller Parent will be entitled to terminate or cause its Affiliates to
terminate all insurance coverage relating to the Company and its businesses,
assets and current or former directors, officers and employees under the
general corporate policies of insurance, cancelable surety bonds and hold
harmless agreements and (ii) Purchaser shall become solely responsible
for all insurance  



 

31  coverage and related risk of loss with respect to the Company and its
businesses, assets and current or former directors, officers and employees.

 



(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.4(a), to the extent that (i) any insurance
policies issued for the benefit of Seller Parent and its Affiliates (" _Seller
s Insurance Policies_") cover any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense
relating to the Company and its businesses, assets and current or former
directors, officers and employees relating to or arising out of occurrences
prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Matters_ ") and (ii) Sellers
Insurance Policies continue after the Closing to permit claims to be made
thereunder with respect to Pre-Closing Matters, Seller Parent shall cooperate
and cause its Affiliates to cooperate with Purchaser in submitting claims with
respect to Pre-Closing Matters on behalf of Purchaser under Sellers
Insurance Policies; provided that Seller Parent and its Affiliates shall be
under no obligation to commence or maintain litigation to enforce any claim
with respect to a Pre-Closing Matter and that Purchaser shall reimburse,
indemnify and hold Seller Parent and its Affiliates harmless from all
liabilities, costs and expenses (including all present or future premiums and
retroactive or prospective premium adjustments, deductibles, self-insured
retentions, legal and administrative costs, attorneys fees, overhead and
costs of compliance under Sellers Insurance Policies) of any nature actually
incurred by Seller or its Affiliates as a result of such claims made under
Sellers Insurance Policies and _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser shall
not request Seller Parent and its Affiliates to make any such claims if, and
to the extent that, such claims are covered by insurance policies held by
Purchaser or its Affiliates. Purchaser shall provide prompt written notice
to Seller Parent of any claim that Purchaser or its Affiliates intends to
request Seller Parent and its Affiliates to submit under Sellers Insurance
Policies with respect to Pre-Closing Matters. Upon the incurrence or accrual
of any such liability, cost or expense relating to claims made under Sellers
Insurance Policies with respect to Pre-Closing Matters and upon receipt from
Seller Parent of a statement of the amount of such liabilities, costs and
expenses in reasonable detail, from time to time, Purchaser shall make
payment promptly to Seller Parent or its Affiliates of the amount indicated in
such statement.



6.5 _Non-Competition Agreement_.



(a) Seller Parent agrees that for a period from the Closing Date until the
date that is 18 months after the Closing Date (the " _Non-Compete Period_ "),
it shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, engage in the Restricted Business anywhere in the United States.



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing:



 

(i) nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be construed to preclude or otherwise
limit the ability of Seller Parent and its Affiliates to own and operate the
Excluded Assets and to acquire, own and operate additional assets and
operations of the same or similar type;



(ii) this Agreement will not be construed to preclude Seller Parent and its
Subsidiaries from acquiring, merging or otherwise combining with, or being

32 indirectly, is engaged in the Restricted Business (any such transaction or
series of related transactions, a " _Combination Transaction_ "; and the
Person with which such Combination Transaction is effected, the " _Combining
Person_ "); _provided_ that, during the Non-Compete Period, Seller Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall not enter into a Combination Transaction, other than a
Major Transaction, with a Combining Person that derived more than 85% of its
consolidated net income during each of the preceding fiscal year and the year-
to-date interim period from the Restricted Business. As used herein, " _Major
Transaction_ " means a Combination Transaction with a Combining Person having
consolidated revenues for such preceding fiscal year in excess of $300
million. Upon any such Combination Transaction not prohibited by this Section
6.5(b)(ii), Seller Parent and its Affiliates (including the Combining Person)
shall be free to conduct and engage in the Restricted Business without regard
to the provisions of Section 6.5(a), but subject in all cases to the
restrictions of Section 6.5(d);



(iii) Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to acquire capital
stock or other equity interests having no more than ten percent (10%) of the

and remains during the Non-Compete Period an investment solely for investment
purposes; and



(iv) Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to conduct merchant
banking, private equity, hedge fund and asset management activities in the
ordinary course of business and, in connection therewith, acquire, directly or
indirectly, capital stock and other equity interests (including but not

acquire capital stock and other equity interests) in any Person, including
without limitation a Person engaged, directly or indirectly, in the
Restricted Business in the United States.



(c) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.5 is not intended to, and
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted to, prohibit,
limit or restrict Seller Parent and its Affiliates from, conducting and
engaging in any of the following businesses and activities, whether or not
any such business or activity is conducted on the date of this Agreement by
Seller Parent and its Affiliates:

permit its Subsidiaries to, use the customer list of the Business to
solicit Persons that were customers of the Business at the Closing Date for
any product or service of Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries, it being
understood that to the extent that prior to the date of this Agreement any
customer names or other information contained in the customer list of the
Business were incorporated into other customer or marketing lists or databases
of Seller Parent and its Affiliates, (i) Seller Parent and its Affiliates
shall not be obligated to purge any of such names or information from such
lists or databases, and the use of such lists or databases by Seller Parent
and its Subsidiaries shall not constitute a breach of the obligations of
Seller and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.5 and (ii) such other
customer or marketing lists or databases of Seller Parent and its Affiliates
into which any such names or information have been incorporated shall not be
considered the customer list of the Business for purposes of this Section
6.5(d).



(e) During the Non-Compete Period, Seller Parent agrees not to and to cause

in excess of $75,000, other than any such Affected Employee who was terminated
by the Company or its Affiliates following the Closing, it being understood

its Subsidiaries regarding such employment without any solicitation by Seller
Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than through (A) general solicitations or
advertisements not directed at the Affected Employees or (B) solicitations
by professional recruiters of Persons not identified by Seller Parent or its
Subsidiaries) shall not constitute a violation of this Section 6.5(e).



 

34 6.6 _Seller Name and Mark_. (a) As promptly as practicable (and in any event
within 30 days) after the Closing Date, Purchaser will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) to, cease the use of the name "JPMorgan",

which consists of or includes any trade name, trademark or service mark owned
or used by Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company)
prior to the Closing Date (" _Seller Marks_ ") and will eliminate the use of
any other designation indicating affiliation after the Closing Date with
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates. As promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 30 days) after the Closing Date, Purchaser, at its own expense,
shall change all names on all signage and all stationery, contracts, and
other business forms and documents to names which (i) do not use the Seller
Marks and (ii) are not in any way similar to the name of Seller Parent, Seller
or any of their Affiliates.

 



(b) Upon Seller Parents request therefor, Purchaser will provide Seller
Parent with a certificate signed on behalf of Purchaser by an appropriate
officer thereof to the effect that the provisions of Section 6.6(a) have been
complied with.



(c) Seller Parent and Seller agree that neither they nor their Affiliates will
adopt or use the "BrownCo" name as all or part of the name of any online
retail discount brokerage, online trading or direct investing business or any
product or service offered in connection therewith. At the Purchasers
request, Seller and Seller Parent will, and will cause each of their
Affiliates to, in each case at Seller Parents expense, cancel any
registration for trademarks that incorporate the name "BrownCo".



 

6.7 _Reorganization_. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete
the Reorganization, in accordance with Section 6.7 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, prior to the Closing Date. Seller and Seller Parent shall, prior the
Closing, cause the Company to enter into each of the Boston Sublease and the
Tampa Sublease. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

the Reorganization.



6.8 _Post-Closing Cooperation and Retention of Records_. (a) Purchaser agrees
that following the Closing, Seller or Seller Parent and/or their independent

personnel of Purchaser and its Affiliates in the review of such books and
records consistent with assistance and cooperation furnished to Purchaser
during the period prior to the Closing. In addition, Purchaser shall make
available to Seller Parent and its Affiliates the Affected Employees whose
assistance, expertise, testimony, notes, recollections or presence (including
participation as a witness in a deposition, hearing or trial) is necessary or
appropriate to assist Seller Parent and its Affiliates in the defense or
prosecution of any legal action or proceeding or similar matter.



(b) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, (i) subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.8(b), preserve and keep
the books and records of the Company held by the Company immediately prior to
the Closing relating to its business for so long as and to the extent
required by Applicable Law (but in no event less than seven years after the
Closing Date) and (ii) to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, make such
books,



 

35 records and personnel available to Seller Parent and its Affiliates, subject
to customary confidentiality commitments reasonable under the circumstances,
as may be reasonably required by any such party or otherwise in accordance
with the requirements of any Governmental Authority, including in connection
with any insurance claims by, legal proceedings against or investigations by
any Governmental Authority of, Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates or for
similar matters, to enable Seller Parent to comply with its obligations under
Applicable Law and this Agreement, to enable Seller Parent to prepare
Tax Returns or other documents relating to Tax planning and compliance by
Seller Parent and its Affiliates or otherwise reasonably necessary for the
conduct of the business and operations of Seller Parent and its Affiliates. In
the event Purchaser or any of its Affiliates wishes to destroy any such books
and records after that time in accordance with its normal document retention
policy, then Purchaser shall (or shall cause such Affiliate to) give 90 days
prior written notice to Seller Parent and (to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law) Seller Parent shall have the right at its option and expense,
upon prior written notice given within such 90-day period, to take possession

steps to ensure that (i) the Company and Purchaser will upon Closing and for
the requisite duration of time thereafter as specified by Applicable Laws,

such books and records will be maintained, preserved and provided as required
by Applicable Laws.



6.9 _Managers  and Officers Indemnification_. (a) For a period of six years
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates and the Company not to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify the
provisions of the Companys organizational documents in any manner that would

Closing, were members, managers, directors, officers or employees of the
Company, unless such modification shall be required by Applicable Law.



(b) In the event the Company or any of its successors or assigns merges or
consolidates with, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to,
any other Person, then, in each such case, proper provision will be made to
cause the successors and assigns of the Company to assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.9.

any of the parties wish to issue a press release with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such press release shall be in
the form approved prior to the date hereof by the other parties hereto. Except
for such press release, no news release or other public announcement
pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be made by
or on behalf of any party hereto without the prior approval of the other
parties, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, in which case the party
making such public announcement or disclosure shall give prior written notice
to the other parties.



6.11 _Affiliate Agreements_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall be
entitled to terminate (i) all Contracts and other arrangements between the
Company and its



 

36 Affiliates providing for lines of credit or other financing arrangements
between any Affiliate of Seller Parent and the Company, as borrower, (ii) all
Contracts and other arrangements, other than agreements providing for the
delivery by any Affiliate of Seller Parent of research reports to the Company
and its customers (which agreements shall be terminated effective as of the
Closing Date as set forth in the Corporate Transition Services Agreement) and
(iii) all other Contracts with Affiliates described in Section 6.11 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule.



6.12 _Seller Customer Information_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, maintain an information security program with respect to
all Seller Customer Data that is designed to meet all requirements of
Applicable Law, including, at a minimum, maintenance of an information
security program that is reasonably sufficient to: (i) ensure the security
and confidentiality of the Seller Customer Data; (ii) protect against any
reasonably foreseeable threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the
Seller Customer Data; (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of
the Seller Customer Data; and (iv) ensure the proper disposal of such Seller
Customer Data (to the extent such disposal is otherwise permitted pursuant to
this Agreement or the Clearing Agreement). Such security measures shall meet
current industry standards and shall be at least as protective as those used
by Seller Parent and its Affiliates as of the date of this Agreement to
protect their own confidential customer information. Without limiting
the foregoing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use at
least the same degree of care in protecting the Seller Customer Data against
unauthorized disclosure as it accords to its own confidential customer
information, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. In the
event Purchaser becomes aware of any unauthorized use of or access to Seller
Customer Data, Purchaser shall immediately notify Seller Parent and shall, at
Purchasers expense, cooperate with Seller Parent in containing, controlling
and remediating such unauthorized disclosure. Purchaser shall not use, or
permit to be used, the Seller Customer Data, in any manner or for any purpose
whatsoever (including for the purpose of soliciting such customers for any
business of any type), except as expressly required to perform its obligations
hereunder and pursuant to the Clearing Agreement. Purchaser shall not
disclose, or permit to be disclosed, the Seller Customer Data, except as
required by Applicable Law or pursuant to a specific requirement imposed by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to compulsory
legal process; provided that Purchaser shall seek the full protection of
confidential treatment for any disclosed Seller Customer Data to the extent
available under Applicable Law governing such disclosure and, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, Purchaser shall (1) provide at least 10 Business
Days prior notice of such proposed disclosure to Seller Parent if reasonably
possible under the circumstances, and (2) seek to redact the Seller Customer
Data to the fullest extent possible under Applicable Law governing such
disclosure. Upon termination of the Clearing Agreement, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, deliver all copies of the Seller Customer Data
to (or as instructed by) Seller Parent and shall not retain any copies
thereof.



6.13 _Further Assurances_. Each party shall cooperate with the others, and
execute and deliver, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
executed and delivered, all such other instruments, including instruments of
conveyance, assignment and transfer, and take all such other actions as such
party may reasonably be requested to take by the other parties hereto from
time to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in order to
effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.



 

37 ARTICLE VII

EMPLOYEE MATTERS



7.1  _Post-Closing Employment and Benefits_. (a) Prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall provide Purchaser with a list of all Retained Employees, which
Retained Employees will be retained by Seller or its Affiliates following the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that prior to the
Closing Date, Seller elects to notify Purchaser that any one or more of the
Retained Employees shall not be retained by Seller and its Affiliates
following the Closing Date, the Company or Purchaser may, but has no
obligation to, elect to continue the employment of, or offer employment to,
such Retained Employee. Upon such employment of such Retained Employee by the
Company or Purchaser, such employee shall thereafter be deemed an Affected
Employee for all purposes hereunder.



(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause one or more of its
Affiliates (other than the Company) to hire or otherwise assume liability for
the Excluded Employees. Immediately following the Closing, Purchaser or one of
its Affiliates shall offer employment to each Excluded Employee in accordance
with its standard hiring procedures, subject to the following conditions: (a)
if on medical or disability leave, such individual is released by his or her
physician to return to active employment and (b) such individual actually
reports for active employment with the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates
promptly following such medical release or expiration of authorized leave;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be
required under this provision to employ any Excluded Employee who does not
accept and report for such employment prior to the later of (i) six months
after the Closing Date, and (ii) the expiration of any period under
Applicable Law. Seller shall retain liability and responsibility for any
Excluded Employee until such employee becomes an employee of Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates or, if earlier, until such employees employment with Seller
or its Affiliates terminates. Purchaser shall assume all liabilities and
responsibilities for each Excluded Employee accruing on and after the date
such Excluded Employee becomes an employee of Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates (and shall treat such Excluded Employee as an Affected Employee as
of such date).



(c) All Affected Employees shall continue employment with the Company or
Purchaser following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the above, in the event
that prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser elects to notify Seller that any one
or more of the Affected Employees shall not be retained by Purchaser and/or
the Company and their Affiliates following the Closing Date, the Seller may
elect to continue the employment of such individual following the Closing as a
Retained Employee. If the Seller does not elect to continue the employment of
such individual following the Closing Date, such individual shall continue to
be deemed an Affected Employee, subject to the provisions of this Article VII,
and in particular, Section 7.2. 



(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Article VII, for the twelve-month
period following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide each Affected Employee who continues in employment with
the Company following the Closing Date with (i) cash compensation
opportunities at least equal to those provided to such Affected Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Affected Employees will immediately begin participation in Purchasers bonus
and incentive structure for similarly situated employees of Purchaser at the
same levels and with the same targets as



 

38 similarly situated employees of Purchaser and (ii) employee benefits at the
same level as the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees
of Purchaser. Subject to Purchasers compliance with the requirements of
Section 7.2, nothing stated herein shall require Purchaser to continue the
employment of any Affected Employee or maintain any benefit plan or policy
sponsored directly by Seller for the benefit of Affected Employees for any
specified period following the Closing Date.



(e) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall give all Affected Employees following
the Closing Date full credit for such Affected Employees service with Seller
or its Affiliates and/or any predecessor entities to the same extent
recognized by Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date
under the employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (including, without limitation, any welfare plan,
pension plan, vacation program or severance program) in which any such
Affected Employees participate following the Closing Date, except (i) for
purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit retirement plans maintained
by Purchaser or its Affiliates and (ii) to the extent such credit would result
in an unintended duplication of benefits.



(f) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected
Employees under any welfare benefit plans in which such Affected Employees may
be eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date and (ii) provide each
Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare plans in which any such Affected Employee is
eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of this
Section 7.1(f), references to Affected Employees shall include the Affected
Employees as well as their eligible dependents who participate in the
applicable plans.



7.2 _Termination and Severance_. Severance benefits shall be payable to an
Affected Employee (taking into account prior service as described in Section
7.1(e)) if, on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, such
Affected Employees employment with the Company or Purchaser terminates due
to (i) a reduction in the Affected Employees total cash compensation; (ii)
changing the Affected Employee from a comparable job position with respect to
duties and responsibilities (without such employees consent); (iii) the
relocation of such Affected Employee to an office of more than 25 miles from
the Affected Employees job location (unless otherwise agreed to by such
Affected Employee); or (iv) the termination of such employee for reasons
other than cause, which shall be reasonably determined in accordance with
policies of Purchaser applicable to similarly situated employees. Affected
Employees eligible for severance under this Section 7.2 shall be entitled to
severance benefits from Purchaser or its Affiliates in an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) the severance benefits that would have been paid under the
JPMorgan Chase Severance Pay Plan as in effect on the Closing Date had such
plan remained applicable to such Affected Employee and (ii) the severance
benefits payable under the JPMorgan Chase Severance Pay Plan as in effect on

39 7.3 _Welfare Plans_.



(a) With respect to each Affected Employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof), Seller Parent shall retain (i) all liabilities and
obligations arising under any Seller Plan that is a group life, accident,
medical, dental or disability plan or similar arrangement (whether or not
insured) to the extent that such liability or obligation relates to claims
incurred (whether or not reported) on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
all liabilities and obligations arising under any workers compensation
arrangement to the extent such liability or obligation relates to events
occurring (whether or not reported) during the period prior to the Closing
Date, including liability for any retroactive workers compensation premiums
attributable to such period. Expenses and benefits with respect to claims
incurred by Affected Employees or their covered dependents on or after the
Closing Date shall be the responsibility of Purchaser and its Affiliates. For
purposes of this Section 7.3, a claim is deemed incurred when the services
that are the subject of the claim are performed; in the case of life
insurance, when the death occurs; in the case of short-term or long-term
disability benefits, when the disability occurs; and in the case of a hospital
stay, when the employee or covered dependent first enters the hospital.



(b) With respect to any Excluded Employee who is in the hospital or is on
short-term disability under any Seller Plan as of the Closing Date, Seller
Parent shall be responsible for all claims and expenses incurred both before
and after the Closing Date in connection with such Excluded Employee (or any
beneficiary or dependent thereof), to the extent that such claims and expenses
are covered by a Seller Plan, until such time, if any, that such Excluded
Employee returns to full time employment with the Company.



7.4 _Accrued Vacation_. With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time
to which any Affected Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy
applicable to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date
(the " _Vacation Policy_ ") (as set forth in Section 7.4 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule), Purchaser and its Affiliates shall allow such
Affected Employee to use such accrued vacation in accordance with the policy;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Purchaser deems it necessary to disallow such
Affected Employee from taking such accrued vacation by the last day of the
calendar year following the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs,
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be liable for and pay in cash to such
Affected Employee by no later than the last day of such calendar year an
amount equal to such accrued vacation time calculated in accordance with the
terms of the Vacation Policy; _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser shall be
liable for and pay in cash an amount equal to any such remaining pre-Closing
Date accrued vacation time to any Affected Employee whose employment
terminates for any reason subsequent to the Closing Date.



7.5 _COBRA_. Seller Parent shall be responsible for all legally mandated
continuation of health care coverage for all Affected Employees and any
of their covered dependents who, prior to the Closing Date, participated in a
Seller or Seller Parent welfare plan and who had or have a loss of health care
coverage due to a qualifying event occurring on or prior to the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall be responsible for all legally mandated continuation of
health care coverage for all Affected Employees and any of their covered
dependents who have a loss of health care coverage due to a qualifying event
occurring following the Closing Date. 



 

40 7.6 _Incentive Compensation_. Seller Parent shall assume liability for and
shall be solely responsible (i) for the payment to any eligible Affected
Employee of all incentive compensation under the 2005 Incentive Compensation
Plan for the portion of the calendar year ending on the Closing Date, which
amounts shall be paid to such Affected Employee by Seller Parent no later
than the time by which incentive compensation under such plan is paid to all
other participants in the plan with respect to the calendar year, and (ii) for
the payment to any Affected Employee of any stay bonus or any other amounts
owed under any retention agreement entered into between the Company, Seller or
Seller Parent with such Affected Employee as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Effective immediately upon the Closing, each
Assumed Employee shall participate in Purchasers incentive compensation plans
in accordance with their terms. Seller Parent and Seller shall use reasonable
efforts to cause all employee retention agreements to which the Company is a
party as of the date hereof, as referenced in Section 4.10(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, to be terminated and replaced with agreements with an
Affilate of Seller Parent other than the Company.



7.7 _Qualified Plans_. (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, except as
required by Applicable Laws, each Affected Employee shall cease to accrue
benefits, if any, under the JP Morgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (the "401(k)
Plan") and the JPMorgan Chase Retirement Plan (the "Retirement Plan"). Seller
shall at all times maintain administration responsibilities and shall be
responsible for the payment of benefits to current or former Affected
Employees with respect to their vested interests in the plans.



(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall take, or
cause Seller to take, any and all action necessary to fully vest the account
balances of Affected Employees under (i) the 401(k) Plan and the Retirement
Plan, respectively, and (ii) any non-qualified excess benefit, deferred
compensation or incentive plan (but excluding any stock awards or resticted
stock units granted in 2005, which shall continue to vest in accordance with
their terms) (a " _Non-Qualified Plan_ ") maintained by Seller Parent or
Seller, and make all applicable contributions under the 401(k) Plan and any
Non-Qualified Plan, respectively, otherwise provided for in the plan year in
which the Closing occurs with respect to compensation earned by Affected
Employees prior to the Closing Date, without regard to any provision of the
401(k) Plan or such Non-Qualified Plan requiring a minimum number of hours of
service, or employment on any particular date, if the applicable Affected
Employees would have qualified for a contribution if they had remained
employed with Seller or the Company.



(c) Purchaser agrees that the Purchasers defined contribution plan, if any,
will accept a direct rollover of the account of any Affected Employee in the
401(k) Plan or lump sum distribution from the Retirement Plan who elects to
make such a direct rollover, including a direct rollover, in kind, of any
loan(s) outstanding to any such Affected Employee under the 401(k) Plan; or
Purchaser will provide a benefit with substantially similar economic value to
such Affected Employee.



7.8 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Article VII
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former
employee of Seller Parent, Seller, the Company and their Affiliates, including
any individual who becomes an Affected Employee and including any beneficiary
or dependent thereof, in respect of continued employment or resumed
employment, and no provision of this Article VII shall create any rights in
any such persons in  



 

41  respect of any benefits that may be _provided_ , directly or indirectly,
under any employee benefit plan or arrangement.

and Purchaser, on the other hand;



(b) By Seller and Seller Parent upon written notice given to Purchaser in the
event of a breach or default in the performance by Purchaser of any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement, which breach or default (i) would
constitute grounds, either individually or in the aggregate, for Seller and

cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach or default,

(c) By Purchaser upon written notice given to Seller and Seller Parent in the
event of a breach or default in the performance by Seller or Seller Parent of

by Purchaser to Seller and Seller Parent;



(d) By either Seller and Seller Parent, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the

ARTICLE X

TAX MATTERS



10.1 _Taxes._



(a) The parties hereto shall comply with their obligations under Section 6.8
hereof and otherwise furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, promptly
upon reasonable request, any information and reasonable assistance relating to
the Company as the requesting party deems reasonably necessary in connection
with the filing of any Tax Returns, the preparation for any audit by any
Taxing authority, the response to any inquiry by a Tax authority, the mailing
or filing of any notice and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax Returns or any other filing required to be made
with any Tax authority or any other matter related to Taxes. Except as
otherwise provided herein, (i) Seller shall have the exclusive authority to
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns that are required to be filed with
respect to the Company for all taxable years or periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date, _provided_ , that in the case of any such Tax Return that is
to be signed by an officer or employee of the Company after the Closing, the
Seller shall deliver the relevant Tax Return to Purchaser for review at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the date, taking into account any relevant
extension,



 

44 on which the Tax Return is due and shall consider in good faith Purchasers
comments thereon, and (ii) except as provided in clause (i), Purchaser shall
have the exclusive obligation and authority to file or cause to be filed all
Tax Returns that are required to be filed with respect to Taxes imposed upon
or by reference to the Company, for any taxable year or other taxable period
(including any period beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date
(a " _Straddle Period_ "), provided that in the case of any Tax Return for a
Straddle Period, Purchaser shall deliver the return to Seller for its review
and approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the date, taking into account any relevant
extensions, on which the Tax Return is due); _provided_ , _ however_ , items
set forth on such Tax Returns shall be treated in a manner consistent with the
past practices (taking into account any amended Tax Returns and the submission
of any IRS Forms 3115) with respect to such items unless otherwise required
by law. For purposes of this Article X, in the case of any Taxes that are
payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax related to the portion
of such period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes
other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or related
to income, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross receipts, sales or use
Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on and included the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to
give effect to the allocation set forth in the foregoing clause (y) shall be
made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company.



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all Tax
Returns based on net income and filed by Seller for periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date shall remain the property of the Seller. Purchaser shall
be given access to such Tax Returns as is reasonably necessary for it to
complete the preparation of its own Tax Returns or Financial Statements, or in
connection with any examination of any Tax Return of the Purchaser by any
Taxing Authority. Any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement between the Company
or Seller with respect to the Company, on the one hand, and Seller and any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date,
and all payments thereunder settled immediately prior to the Closing, with no
payments permitted thereunder on or after the Closing.



(c) Purchaser shall, if Seller or Seller Parent so requests, and at Sellers
expense, cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates to file for and obtain any
Tax refund or credit related to the Company that relates to any period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date, provided that such filing is not reasonably
expected to increase the Taxes of the Company or Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates in any post-Closing Date period, and if Purchaser at any time
receives a Tax refund or credit related to the Company that relates to any
period prior to the Closing Date (and that was not taken into account in the
computation of the Closing Date Adjusted Book Value pursuant to Section 2.3 of
this Agreement) then it shall promptly pay over such refund or the amount of
such credit to Seller.



(d) All Transfer Taxes shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by
Seller when due (regardless of the party upon whom such Transfer Taxes are
initially imposed), and the party required by applicable law will file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable law, the



 

45 other party will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. The expense of such filings shall be paid one-half by
Purchaser and one-half by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchasers
aggregate liability under this Section 10.1(d) shall not exceed $100,000, and
all Transfer Taxes and expenses of filings in excess of that amount shall be
borne by Seller.



(e) Purchaser hereby assumes Sellers entire information reporting
obligations (but not the Sellers Tax withholding, remittance or payment
obligations) with respect to information Tax Returns of the Company (including
Forms 1042-S, forms in the series 1098, 1099 and 5498, and Forms W-2G)
required to be filed with respect to the taxable year of the Closing,
_provided_ , that the relevant Taxing Authority permits a single Tax Return to
be filed for the year of the Closing, and _provided_ , that Seller shall have
furnished Purchaser with all information and reasonable assistance relating to
transactions occurring during the pre-Closing portion of the taxable year of
the Closing, in accordance with Section 10.1(a). Purchaser and Seller
intend for their agreement in this Section to meet, and Purchaser agrees to
satisfy, each of the requirements of Section 5 of IRS Revenue Procedure 99-50,
as amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Closing occurs within the
last three months of the 2005 calendar year, Seller shall retain the
obligations described in the first sentence of this Section 10.1(e) for
periods through the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall assume obligations for
periods thereafter (provided that Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to provide any cooperation and assistance to Purchaser that would facilitate
Purchasers fulfillment of such obligations with respect to the period
beginning on the day after the Closing Date and ending at the end of the 2005
calendar year). Nothing in this Section 10.1(e) shall in any way limit or
otherwise reduce Sellers indemnification for Taxes under Article XI hereof. 



ARTICLE XI

INDEMNIFICATION



11.1 _Indemnification by Seller and Seller Parent_. (a) From and after the
Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this Article XI, Seller and
Seller Parent, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify Purchaser and its
officers, directors, employees and Affiliates (including the Company after the
Closing) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Purchaser Entities_ ") and to hold
each of them harmless from and against, any and all actions, causes of
actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, judgments, settlements,
claims, liabilities, losses, costs, Taxes, damages, fines, fees, deficiencies,
expenses or penalties (including reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and
disbursements in connection with any action, suit or proceeding against such
Person but excluding, in any case, loss of profits or other consequential
damages and punitive or other exemplary damages, except to the extent that
such damages have been awarded to a Third Party against an Indemnified Party)
(collectively, " _Damages_ ") suffered, paid or incurred by any Indemnified
Purchaser Entity resulting from or caused by: (i) any failure of any of the
representations and warranties made by Seller and Seller Parent in Article IV
of this Agreement (other than those made in Section 4.11 (Taxes)) to be true
and correct as of the date of this Agreement or as of, and as if made on, the
Closing Date (or, in the case of any representations and warranties that
expressly speak as of an earlier date, as of such earlier date); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such representation or warranty (other than the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.6 or Section 4.9(ii)) is
qualified in any respect by materiality or



 

46 Material Adverse Effect, for purposes of this paragraph, such qualifiers will
in all respects be ignored; (ii) any nonfulfillment or breach by Seller or
Seller Parent of any covenant or agreement of Seller or Seller Parent
contained in this Agreement; and (iii) any Excluded Liabilities.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 11.1,
the Indemnified Purchaser Entities shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.1(a) with respect to any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i):



(i) only if the amount of Damages with respect to such claim exceeds $100,000
(any claim involving Damages equal to or less than such amount being referred
to as a " _De Minimis Claim_ ");



(ii) only if, and then only to the extent that, the aggregate Damages to all
Indemnified Purchaser Entities (without duplication), with respect to all
claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i) (other than De
Minimis Claims), exceed $10,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), whereupon (subject
to the provisions of Section 11.1(b)(iii) below) Seller and Seller Parent
shall be obligated to pay in full all such amounts but only to the extent
such aggregate Damages are in excess of the amount of the Deductible; and
_provided_ that the Indemnified Purchaser Entities shall not be entitled to
aggregate Damages in excess of five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price; and



(iii) only with respect to claims for indemnification made on or before the
last day of the applicable Survival Period.



11.2 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. (a) In addition to and not in limitation
of the indemnities provided in Section 6.4 (which section sets forth the
exclusive remedy of the parties hereto in respect of the matters covered
thereby), from and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of
this Article XI, Purchaser agrees to indemnify Seller and Seller Parent and
their respective officers, directors, employees and Affiliates (collectively,
the " _Indemnified Seller Entities_ ") and to hold each of them harmless from
and against any and all Damages suffered, paid or incurred by any Indemnified
Seller Entity resulting from or caused by: (i) any failure of any of the
representations and warranties made by Purchaser in Article V of this
Agreement to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement or as of,
and as if made on, the Closing Date (or, in the case of any representations
and warranties that expressly speak as of an earlier date, as of such earlier
date); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such representation or warranty is
qualified in any respect by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, for
purposes of this paragraph, such qualifiers will in all respects be ignored;
(ii) any nonfulfillment or breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement; and (iii) any action taken by
Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing Date in connection with the
conduct of the businesses of the Company except for actions required under
this Agreement.



 

47 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 11.2,
the Indemnified Seller Entities shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 11.2(a) with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.2(a)(i):



(i) only with respect to claims which do not constitute De Minimis Claims;



(ii) only if, and then only to the extent that, the aggregate Damages to all
Indemnified Seller Entities (without duplication), with respect to all claims
for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than De Minimis
Claims), exceed the amount of the Deductible, whereupon (subject to the
provisions of Section 11.2(b)(iii) below) Purchaser shall be obligated to pay
in full all such amounts but only to the extent such aggregate Damages are in
excess of the amount of the Deductible; and provided that the Indemnified
Seller Entities shall not be entitled to aggregate Damages in excess of five
percent (5%) of the Purchase Price; and



(iii) only with respect to claims for indemnification made on or before the
last day of the applicable Survival Period.



11.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) If an Indemnified Purchaser Entity or
an Indemnified Seller Entity (each, an " _Indemnified Entity_ ") believes that
a claim, demand or other circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably
be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this Article XI
(whether or not the amount of Damages relating thereto is then quantifiable),
such Indemnified Entity shall assert its claim for indemnification by giving
written notice thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the parties from which
indemnification is sought (collectively, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") (i) if
the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim for indemnification is, or
relates to, a claim, suit, action or proceeding, including an audit
or proceeding with respect to Taxes, brought by a Person not a party to this
Agreement or Affiliated with any such party (a " _Third Party_ "), within 30
days following receipt of notice of such claim, suit, action or proceeding by
such Indemnified Entity, or (ii) if the event or occurrence giving rise to
such claim for indemnification is not, or does not relate to, a claim, suit,
action or proceeding brought by a Third Party, within 30 days after the
discovery by the Indemnified Entity of the circumstances giving rise to such
claim for indemnity. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim in reasonable
detail and shall provide an estimate to the extent then quantifiable of the
amount of Damages relating thereto. Failure of the Indemnified Entity to give
notice as set forth in this Section 11.3 shall not affect the indemnification
provided under clause (i) above except and to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.



(b) If any claim or demand by an Indemnified Entity under this Article XI
relates to an action or claim filed or made against an Indemnified Entity by a
Third Party, the Indemnifying Party may elect to assume at its sole cost and
expense the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party
and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party by written notice to the
Indemnified Party. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to
the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense



 

48 thereof, unless counsel to the Indemnified Party advises such Indemnified
Party in writing that the Third Party claim involves potential conflicts of
interest which make representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party inappropriate. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such
defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel (which shall be at its own expense,
except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence) separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. The Indemnifying Party may
pay, settle or compromise a Third Party claim, _provided_ that no such
settlement or compromise shall be permitted without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) if it would impose any material injunctive relief or other material
nonmonetary obligation binding on the Indemnified Party or any monetary
damages (including Taxes) that would not be fully indemnified hereunder
(subject to the penultimate sentence of this Section 11.3(b). If the
Indemnifying Party (i) advises such Indemnified Entity in writing that the
Indemnifying Party will not elect to defend, settle or compromise such action
or claim or (ii) fails to make such an election in writing, such Indemnified
Entity may, at its option, defend, settle or otherwise compromise or pay such
action or claim; _provided_ that any such settlement or compromise shall be
permitted hereunder only with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Unless and until the
Indemnifying Party makes an election in accordance with this Section 11.3(b)
to defend, settle or compromise such action, all of the Indemnified Entitys
reasonable costs and expenses arising out of the defense, settlement or
compromise of any such action or claim shall be Damages subject to
indemnification hereunder to the extent provided herein. Each Indemnified
Entity shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all information
reasonably available to such Indemnified Entity relating to such action or
claim. In addition, the parties shall render to each other such assistance
as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate
defense of any such action or claim. In the event the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of (or otherwise elects to negotiate or settle or
compromise) any action or claim as described above, the Indemnified Entity
shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for all costs and expenses incurred by
the Indemnifying Party in connection with such defense (or negotiation,
settlement or compromise) to the extent that such costs and expenses do not
exceed the amount of the remaining Deductible. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in the case of any audit or other Tax
proceeding in respect of a taxable period of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the Company) ending after
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have sole control of the conduct and
resolution of such audit or other proceeding, provided that Purchaser (i) will
keep Seller promptly informed of any developments relating to any Excluded
Taxes that are at issue in such audit or proceeding, (ii) will consider in
good faith any proposals made by Seller regarding the conduct of such audit or
proceeding in relation to such Excluded Taxes and (iii) will not settle or
otherwise compromise any issue in a manner that would adversely affect the Tax
liability of the Seller or any of its Affiliates for any taxable year or
period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date without
the Sellers prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).



11.4 _General_. (a) Each Indemnified Entity shall be obligated in connection
with any claim for indemnification under this Article XI to use
all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any insurance proceeds
available to such Indemnified Entity with regard to the applicable claims and
to recover any amounts to which it may be entitled in respect of the
applicable claims pursuant to contractual or other indemnification rights
that they may have



 

49 against Third Parties. The amount that the Indemnifying Party is or may be
required to pay to any Indemnified Entity pursuant to this Article XI shall
be reduced (retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance proceeds, net tax
benefits, if any (it being understood that net tax benefits shall be computed
on a hypothetical (rather than actual) basis, using an assumed 40% tax rate
and taking into account (x) any Tax decrease resulting from a Tax deduction in
respect of indemnified Damages and (y) any Tax increase resulting from the
Indemnified Partys receipt of payments under this Article XI in respect of
indemnified Damages (including any Tax increase that results from the loss of
Tax deductions by reason of a decrease in the Purchase Price corresponding to
the amount of such payments in accordance with Section 11.4(e)), it being
further understood that for this purpose any Tax increase resulting from a
decrease in Purchase Price shall be calculated on a present value basis,
assuming a 15-year amortization period) or other amounts actually recovered by
or on behalf of such Indemnified Entity in reduction of the related Damages.
If an Indemnified Entity shall have received the payment required by this
Agreement from the Indemnifying Party in respect of Damages and shall
subsequently receive insurance proceeds, net tax benefits or other amounts in
respect of such Damages, then such Indemnified Entity shall promptly repay to
the Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds,
net tax benefits or other amounts actually received. 



(b) In addition to the requirements of Section 11.4(a), each Indemnified
Entity shall be obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification
under this Article XI to use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably
be expected to give rise to such Damages.



(c) The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to any right of action which
the Indemnified Entity may have against any other Person with respect to any
matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.



(d) The indemnification provided in this Article XI shall be the
exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any party hereto with respect to
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, or otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.



(e) The amount of any payments made pursuant to this Article XI shall be
treated by Purchaser and Seller and their respective Affiliates as adjustments
to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, except to the extent that a
contrary treatment is required by Applicable Law.
