and among TECO ENERGY, INC., a Florida corporation (" _Purchaser_ "),
CONTINENTAL ENERGY SYSTEMS LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Seller_ "), and NEW MEXICO GAS INTERMEDIATE, INC., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ ").

Purchaser desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell
to Purchaser, all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the " _Shares_ "), of the Company.

Accordingly, the parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _Purchase and Sale of Shares; Closing_

SECTION 1.01. _Purchase and Sale of the Shares._ On the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, transfer
and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from Seller, the
Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $950,000,000 (Nine Hundred and Fifty
Million Dollars) (the " _Purchase Price_ "), payable as set forth below in
Sections 1.02 and 1.03 and subject to adjustment as provided in Section 1.04.
The purchase and sale of the Shares and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including, in the case of Purchaser, the Financing, are referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Transactions_ ".

SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The purchase and sale of the Shares (the " _Closing_
") shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth
Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m. on the second Business Day
following the date of satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law,
waiver by all parties) of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01, or, if on
such day any condition set forth in Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been
satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the party or
parties entitled to the benefits thereof), as soon as practicable after all
the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waived by the parties entitled to the benefits thereof), or
at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between
Purchaser and Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties agree that the
Closing shall not take place on or prior to January 30, 2014. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing
Date_ ".

SECTION 1.03. _Transactions to Be Effected at the Closing._ At the Closing:

(a) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser certificates representing the Shares,
duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank
in proper form for transfer, with appropriate Transfer Tax stamps, if any,
affixed. (b) Purchaser shall deliver to Seller payment, by wire transfer to a
bank account designated in writing by Seller (such designation to be made at
least one Business Day prior to the Closing Date), in immediately available
funds in an amount equal to the Closing Date Amount.

 

(c) Purchaser shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer to the
bank account designated in writing by the Escrow Agent (such designation to
be made at least one Business Day prior to the Closing Date), the Escrow
Amount, which amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent in an escrow fund (the
" _Escrow Fund_ "), subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement (including Section 1.04(d)(ii) and Article IX).

(d) Purchaser shall pay the CES Credit Agreement Repayment Amount as
contemplated by Section 6.11(a).

(e) Purchaser shall pay the NMGC Credit Agreement Repayment Amount as
contemplated by Section 6.11(b).

(f) Seller shall, or Seller shall cause the Company to, deliver evidence
satisfactory to Purchaser at the Closing that, effective as of the Closing
Date, each of the officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiary listed in
Section 1.03(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter and the members of the board
of directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiary have resigned from (or
shall otherwise have ceased to hold) their positions as officers or directors
of the Company or the Company Subsidiary. 

(g) Seller shall, or Seller shall cause the Company to, deliver to Purchaser
at the Closing valid certificates issued by applicable Governmental Entities
which evidence that each of the Company, the Company Subsidiary and Seller is
in good standing in its state of incorporation or organization.

 

SECTION 1.04. _Purchase Price Adjustment._ (a) Not less than two Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser
a good faith estimate which shall set forth the estimated Closing Cash ("
_Estimated Cash_ "), the estimated Closing Indebtedness (" _Estimated
Indebtedness_ ") and the estimated Closing Working Capital (" _Estimated
Working Capital_ "). The " _Closing Date Amount_ " shall equal the Purchase
Price _minus_ the Escrow Amount _plus_ Estimated Cash _minus_ Estimated
Indebtedness _plus_  Estimated Working Capital _minus_ Target Working
Capital.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Estimated Indebtedness and the Closing
Indebtedness shall include (A) all principal amounts outstanding under the CES
Credit Agreement, the NMGC Credit Agreement and the NMGC Notes and all accrued
interest related thereto through the Closing Date and (B) all
prepayment premiums, fees, expenses, penalties or other amounts payable
through the Closing Date in connection with each of the CES Credit Agreement
and the NMGC Credit Agreement, in the case of each of (A) and (B), without
giving effect to the payments contemplated by Section 1.03 or Section 6.11.

 



2 (b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver
to Seller a statement (the " _Statement_ "), setting forth (i) Cash as of the
close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date ("
_Closing Cash_ "), (ii) Working Capital as of the close of business on
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (" _Closing Working Capital_
") and (iii) the outstanding principal and accrued interest of all
Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing (but without giving effect
to the repayment of the Indebtedness to be repaid under Section 6.11) and all
prepayment premiums, fees, expenses or penalties payable in connection with
the repayment of the Indebtedness to be repaid pursuant to Sections 6.11(a)
and 6.11(b) (" _Closing Indebtedness_ ").

(c) During the 30-day period following SellerÂ’s receipt of the
Statement, Seller and its independent auditors shall be permitted to review
the working papers relating to the Statement. The Statement shall become final
and binding upon the parties on the 30th day following delivery thereof,
unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement with the Statement (a
" _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Purchaser on or prior to such date. Any
Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is given by Seller in a
timely manner, then the Statement shall become final and binding upon Seller
and Purchaser on the earlier of (A) the date Seller and Purchaser resolve in
writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in
the Notice of Disagreement and (B) the date any disputed matters are finally
resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the 60-day period following
the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. During such
period, Purchaser and its independent auditors shall be permitted to review
the working papers prepared in connection with SellerÂ’s preparation of the
Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 60-day period, Seller and Purchaser
shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ")
for arbitration any and all matters that remain in dispute and were properly
included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Accounting Firm shall be Grant
Thornton LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed
upon by the parties hereto in writing. Seller and Purchaser agree to use
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving
the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within 30 days following such
submission. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting
Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. The cost of any arbitration (including the
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and reasonable attorney fees and
expenses of the parties) pursuant to this Section 1.04 shall be borne by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm,
which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting
Firm at the time its determination on the merits of the matters submitted is
rendered. The fees and disbursements of SellerÂ’s independent auditors
incurred in connection with their review of the Statement and any Notice of

 



3  Disagreement shall be borne by Seller, and the fees and disbursements of
PurchaserÂ’s independent auditors incurred in connection with their review of
the Statement and any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Purchaser.

(d) _Net Adjustment Amount._ (i) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive,
Purchaser shall, within 10 Business Days after the Statement becomes final and
binding on the parties, pay to Seller by wire transfer in immediately
available funds the Net Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon at a
rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its prime rate, calculated on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed divided by 365, from the Closing Date to the
date of payment.

 

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, Seller and Purchaser shall,
within 10 Business Days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the
parties, jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Purchaser from the funds,
if any, then constituting the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the lesser of (A)
the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount, together with interest
thereon at a rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced
publicly by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its prime rate, calculated on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365, from the
Closing Date to the date of payment and (B) the funds, if any, then
constituting the Escrow Fund.

(e) During the period of time from and after the Closing Date through the
resolution of any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this
Section 1.04, Purchaser shall not take any action with respect to the
accounting books and records of the Company on which the Statement is to be
based that is not consistent with the CompanyÂ’s past practices. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no changes shall be made in any
reserve or other account existing as of the date of the Audited Balance
Sheet except as a result of events occurring after the date of the Audited
Balance Sheet and, in such event, only in a manner consistent with past
practices. During the period of time from and after the Closing Date through
the resolution of any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this
Section 1.04, Purchaser shall afford, and shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiary to afford, to Seller and any accountants, counsel or
financial advisers retained by Seller in connection with any adjustment to
the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 1.04 reasonable access during
normal business hours to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel and
records of the Company and the Company Subsidiary relevant to the adjustment
contemplated by this Section 1.04; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company

6 ARTICLE II

_Representations and Warranties of Seller_

Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser (acknowledging that Purchaser is
relying on such representations and warranties entering into this Agreement
and the Transactions) that, except as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter:

 

SECTION 2.01. _Organization, Standing and Power._ Seller is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized and has full corporate power and authority and possesses
all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals
necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties
and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than
such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of
which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of Seller to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or a material adverse effect on
the ability of Seller to consummate the Transactions (any such material
adverse effect, a " _Seller Material Adverse Effect_ "). Seller is duly
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business
or its ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification
necessary, except for such failures that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material
Adverse Effect.

SECTION 2.02.  _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability._ Seller
has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and
delivery by Seller of, and the performance of its obligations under, this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the
consummation by Seller of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Seller. Seller has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement, and will duly execute and deliver the Escrow
Agreement and each other Ancillary Document to which Seller is a party, and
this Agreement constitutes, and the Escrow Agreement and each other Ancillary
Document to which Seller is a party when executed and delivered will
constitute, in each case, its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms.

SECTION 2.03. _No Conflicts; Consents._ (a) The execution and delivery by
Seller of, and the performance of its obligations under, this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Ancillary Documents do not, and the consummation of
the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of

such Regulatory Permits are in full force and effect, and the Company and the
Company Subsidiary have complied and are in compliance with the
terms thereof, except for instances of noncompliance that, individually or in

operative tariffs or rates charged or to be charged, the subject matter of
each filing or Regulatory Proceeding, and the date by which the Company or the
Company Subsidiary intends to make or initiate, or has been ordered to make
or initiate, such filings or Regulatory Proceedings. All charges that have

respects, been charged in accordance with the terms and conditions of valid
and effective tariffs. Except for the gas cost recovery type rates or as

23 ARTICLE IV

_Representations and Warranties of Purchaser_

Purchaser represents and warrants to Seller and the Company (acknowledging
that Seller and the Company are relying on such representations and warranties
entering into this Agreement and the Transactions) as follows:

 

SECTION 4.01. _Organization, Standing and Power._ Purchaser is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized and has full corporate power and authority and possesses
all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals
necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such
franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or a material adverse effect on
the ability of Purchaser to consummate the Transactions (any such material
adverse effect, a " _Purchaser Material Adverse Effect_ "). Purchaser and
each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
where the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of its properties
make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 4.02. _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability._ Purchaser
has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and

this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the
consummation by Purchaser of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Purchaser. Purchaser has duly
executed and delivered this Agreement, and will duly execute and deliver the
Escrow Agreement and each other Ancillary Document to which Purchaser is a
party, and this Agreement constitutes, and the Escrow Agreement and each other
Ancillary Document to which Purchaser is a party when executed and delivered
will constitute, in each case, its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms. No vote of holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Purchaser is required in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents or the consummation of the Transactions.

SECTION 4.03. _No Conflicts; Consents._ (a) The execution and delivery by
Purchaser of, and the performance of its obligations under, this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, do not, and the
consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and
thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to
loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other
than

 



24  Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of Purchaser or any of
its subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the charter or organizational
documents of Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any Contract to which
Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their
respective properties or assets is bound or (iii) subject to the filings and
other matters referred to in Section 4.03(b), any Judgment or Law applicable
to Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries or their respective properties or
assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such
items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with or
Governmental Authorization from, any Governmental Entity is required to be
obtained or made by or with respect to Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents or the consummation of the Transactions other than (i)
compliance with and filings under the HSR Act, (ii) compliance with and such
filings as may be required under applicable state property transfer laws or
Environmental Laws, (iii) such filings as may be required in connection with
the Transfer Taxes, (iv) approval by the New Mexico Public Regulation
Commission under the New Mexico Public Utility Act and any applicable rules
and regulations thereunder (the approval in this clause (iv), the " _Purchaser
Required Regulatory Approval_ " and, together with the Seller Required
Regulatory Approval and the Company Required Regulatory Approval, the "
_Required Regulatory Approvals_ ") and (v) such other items (A) required
solely by reason of the participation of the Company or Seller (as opposed to
any third party) in the Transactions or (B) that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.04.  _Brokers._ No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other person, other than Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC, the fees and expenses of
which will be paid by Purchaser, is entitled to any brokerÂ’s, finderÂ’s,
financial advisorÂ’s or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser.

SECTION 4.05. _Financing._ Purchaser has delivered to Seller a true and
complete copy of the executed commitment letter, dated as of May 25, 2013 (as
amended, modified, or otherwise replaced pursuant to Section 6.16, the "
_Financing Commitment_ "), pursuant to which the financial institutions
identified therein have committed, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein (together with any
alternative financing obtained in accordance with Section 6.16(a), the "
_Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitment has
not been amended or modified in any respect, except, in each case, with the
prior written consent of Seller, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated and none of the commitments contained in the Financing Commitment
has been withdrawn, terminated, rescinded or otherwise modified in any
respect. The Financing Commitment is in full force and effect and is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Purchaser. There are no side Contracts,
arrangements or understandings (except for customary fee letters and
engagement letters, true and complete copies of which have been provided to
Seller,

 



25  with only fee amounts redacted, none of which redactions would adversely
affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination
or aggregate principal amount of the Financing) relating to the Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment. The only
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the obligations of the
lenders to fund the full amount of the Financing are those expressly set
forth in the Financing Commitment. As of the date of this Agreement and
assuming the accuracy of SellerÂ’s and the CompanyÂ’s representations contained
in Article II and Article III, respectively, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Purchaser or any of the other parties to the Financing Commitment under any
term, or a failure of any condition, of the Financing Commitment or otherwise
be reasonably likely to result in any portion of the Financing contemplated
thereby to be unavailable. As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser does
not have any reason to believe that it or any of the other parties to the
Financing Commitment will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of the Financing Commitment required to be satisfied by it or that
any portion of the Financing to be made thereunder will otherwise not
be available to Purchaser on a timely basis to consummate the Transactions.
Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by
the terms of the Financing Commitment to be paid on or before the date of this
Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing
Date. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 and
7.02 and performance by Seller and the Company of their obligations under this
Agreement: (A) the proceeds from the Financing will provide Purchaser with
funds, together with funds on hand, at the Closing, sufficient for Purchaser
to satisfy all of PurchaserÂ’s obligations under this Agreement, including the
obligations under Article I and Section 6.11, and (B) as of the Closing,
Purchaser will have readily available funds that are sufficient to effect the
Closing on the terms contemplated hereby.

SECTION 4.06. _Litigation._ There is no suit, action, proceeding, arbitration,
audit or investigation pending against Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, nor are there any
Judgments outstanding against Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected
to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Purchaser,
there is no suit, action, proceeding, arbitration, audit or investigation
threatened against Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries that, individually or
in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 6.01. _Access to Information._ The Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiary to, afford to PurchaserÂ’s officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Closing Date to
all their respective books, contracts, commitments, personnel (including

and leased facilities and properties and permit Purchaser to make
such reasonable inspections thereof as Purchaser may reasonably request and,
during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiary

Company or its affiliates. If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant
to the proviso to the 

 



30  preceding sentence, the Company shall, and Seller shall cause the Company
to, inform Purchaser as to the general nature of what is being withheld, and
the Company shall, and Seller shall cause the Company to, cooperate in
seeking a way to allow disclosure of such material to the extent doing so

agreement, dated February 27, 2013, between NMGC and Purchaser, as amended
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

SECTION 6.02. _Reasonable Best Efforts._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the

regulatory, judicial, administrative or other, to which it is a party

31  connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents and the Transactions required under or with respect to the Required
Regulatory Approvals; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller, the Company and
Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in connection with determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is required in connection with the Transactions (including with
respect to the Required Regulatory Approvals) and seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings; and

(vi) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Transactions and fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(b) _General Procedures._ Seller and Purchaser shall jointly, and on an equal
basis, coordinate the overall development of the positions to be taken and
the regulatory actions to be requested in such applications and filings for
approval of the matters contemplated by this Agreement which require
regulatory approval and of all other regulatory matters incidental
thereto which are to be addressed in such applications and filings. Seller,
the Company and Purchaser shall furnish to each other all information required
for any application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any
applicable Law in connection with the Transactions. Seller, the Company and
Purchaser shall consult, in good faith, with each other in respect of any
communications, meetings or other contacts, formal or informal, oral or
written, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions
(including with respect to the Required Regulatory Approvals) or any related
declaration, filing, registration, notice, authorization, consent or approval,
and shall provide each other with advance notice and an opportunity to attend
all meetings and oral communications with any Governmental Entity relating to
any of the foregoing. Seller, the Company and Purchaser will provide each
other with reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon and will
consider in good faith the views of each other in connection with all written
communications with a Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions
(including with respect to the Required Regulatory Approvals) and will
promptly provide each other with copies of all written communications to or
from any Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions (including with
respect to the Required Regulatory Approvals). No party to this Agreement
shall consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing at the behest of any
Governmental Entity without the consent of the other, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. No party to this Agreement,
directly or indirectly through one or more of their respective affiliates,
shall take any action, including acquiring or making any investment in any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business
organization or any division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be
expected to cause a material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions
contained in Article VII. Nothing in this Section 6.02 will apply to or
restrict communications or other actions by the Company or the Company
Subsidiary with or with respect to Governmental Entities in connection with
their business in the ordinary course of business.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser agrees to take, or cause to be
taken, any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and all
undertakings

 



32  necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment asserted by any
Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining the Required Regulatory
Approvals applicable to Purchaser, the Company or the Company Subsidiary, so
as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, including (i)
agreeing to conditions imposed by any Governmental Entity and proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of assets
or businesses of Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries or (ii) accepting any operational restrictions, including
restrictions on the ability to change rates or charges or standards of
service, or otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit any of
PurchaserÂ’s or its subsidiariesÂ’ (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiary following the Closing Date) freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain or freely operate, any of the assets, properties,
licenses, rights, product lines, operations or businesses of Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, in each case as may be
required in order to obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals or to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser shall not be required to, and Seller, the Company and the Company
Subsidiary shall not, in connection with obtaining any consents or approvals
hereunder, or in connection with otherwise complying with any provisions of
this Agreement, consent to or take any action of the types described above
with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiary, including agreeing to
conditions, proposing or making any divestiture or other undertaking or
proposing, accepting or entering into any consent decree, hold separate order
or operational restriction with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiary, in each case, that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and
the Company Subsidiary, taken as a whole. For the avoidance of doubt, none of
the exclusions set forth in the definition of "Company Material Adverse
Effect" shall be deemed to apply to any reference to "material adverse effect"
in this Section 6.02(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall not be required to, and Purchaser
shall not, in connection with obtaining any consents or approvals hereunder,
or in connection with otherwise complying with any provisions of this
Agreement, consent to (x) the taking of any action or the imposition of any
terms, conditions, limitations or standards of service the effectiveness or
consummation of which is not conditional upon the occurrence of the Closing or
(y) the imposition of any terms, conditions or limitations on or with respect
to Seller, any of its affiliates, any of their respective businesses or any of
the benefits to Seller and its affiliates of the Transactions.

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section
6.02, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from any
Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions.

 



33  Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any
filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the Transactions. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of
the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company or
the Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Company
and the Company Subsidiary shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision
over their business operations.

SECTION 6.03. _Notification._ Each of Seller and the Company shall give prompt
notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to Seller and the
Company, of (i) the breach or failure to be true and correct of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to be true and correct would give rise to the failure of a
condition in Section 7.02(a), 7.02(b) or 7.03(a), as applicable, or (ii) the
failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

SECTION 6.04. _Public Announcements._ Subject to Section 6.16, any public
announcement or similar publicity with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions will be issued, if at all, at such time and in such manner as
mutually agreed to by Seller and Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not prohibit any party from making, issuing or releasing any
announcements, statements or acknowledgments that such party is required to
make, issue or release by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or
listing rules of a securities exchange or trading market or inter-dealer
quotation system ( _provided_ that such party has used reasonable efforts to
give the other party prior notice thereof to review such disclosure).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may issue a press release with the
prior approval of the other party (with such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld). Subject to Section 6.16, except as otherwise agreed to by Seller
and Purchaser or required by Law, prior to the Closing, each party and its
representatives and agents will keep this Agreement and any information about
the Transactions strictly confidential and shall not make any disclosure of
this Agreement to any other person. Seller and Purchaser will consult with
each other concerning the means by which the Company and the Company
Subsidiary, employees, customers, and suppliers and others having dealings
with the Company and the Company Subsidiary will be informed of the
Transactions.

 



34 SECTION 6.05. _Benefits._ (a) For a period of one year following the Closing
Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Purchaser shall either (i) maintain, or
cause its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company Subsidiary) to
maintain, for the benefit of the employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Company
Employees_ "), the Benefit Plans, the Benefit Agreements and the other
employee benefit plans and compensation arrangements of the Company Employees
at the compensation and benefit levels in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date or (ii) provide, or cause its subsidiaries (including the Company
and the Company Subsidiary) to provide (A) compensation to the Company
Employees that, in the aggregate, is substantially comparable to the
compensation provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (B) benefits to the Company Employees that, in the aggregate,
are substantially comparable to the benefits provided to the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall provide each
Company Employee who is terminated during the Continuation Period with
severance payments and benefits that are no less favorable than those
disclosed in Section 6.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) During the Continuation Period, Purchaser shall provide or cause its
subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company Subsidiary) to provide
each former employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiary who, immediately
prior to the Closing Date, is receiving long-term disability payments or
benefits (which shall be deemed to include medical benefits) or retiree
medical benefits under any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement (" _LTD and
Retiree Medical Beneficiaries_ "), long-term disability payments or benefits
or retiree medical benefits (as applicable) at a level that is substantially
comparable to the level of such payments or benefits provided to such
individuals immediately prior to the Closing Date. A list of LTD and Retiree
Medical Beneficiaries as of the date of this Agreement is set forth in
Section 6.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Prior to the Closing Date,
but no earlier than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall provide to Purchaser an updated list of LTD and Retiree Medical
Beneficiaries in the form of Section 6.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter
as of such date.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiary to, honor all obligations under the Benefit
Plans and Benefit Agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(d) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries (including the Company
and the Company Subsidiary) to, cause any "employee benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA) maintained by
Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiary) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans) to
recognize each Company EmployeeÂ’s service with the Company or the Company
Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor of the Company or the
Company Subsidiary, to the extent service with such predecessor is recognized
by the Company or the Company Subsidiary), for all purposes, including
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

 



35 (e) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries (including the Company
and the Company Subsidiary) to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or any
of its subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Closing Date,
except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been
satisfied or waived under the comparable Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries (including the
Company and the Company Subsidiary) to, recognize, or cause to be recognized,
the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses
incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying
such yearÂ’s deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Closing Date.

 

(f) For a period of 90 days following the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company Subsidiary) to,
provide any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, as amended, and any similar state or local law, and
otherwise comply with such laws with respect to the Company
Employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement
shall create any right in any employee to continued employment by Seller, the
Company, the Company Subsidiary, Purchaser or any respective subsidiary
thereof, or preclude the ability of Seller, the Company, the Company
Subsidiary, Purchaser or any respective subsidiary thereof to terminate the
employment of any employee for any reason. This Section 6.05 shall be binding
upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this
Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.05, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.05 or is intended to
be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of
any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or policy of Seller, the
Company, the Company Subsidiary, Purchaser or any respective subsidiary
thereof. No Company Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.05 and this Section 6.05 shall not create
such rights in any such person. 

(g) Seller shall remain solely liable for all obligations under the Former
Director Agreements, and none of Purchaser, the Company, the Company
Subsidiary or any respective affiliate thereof shall have any liability with
respect to any of the Former Director Agreements. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Former Director Agreements_ " means each agreement between
Seller, on the one hand, and any former director of the Company who was an
employee of Seller, on the other hand. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement or the Former Director Agreements to the contrary, Seller shall not
assign any of the Former Director Agreements to the Company or the Company
Subsidiary.

 



36 (h) Seller shall remain solely liable for any and all obligations arising from
or relating to any profit participation interest in connection with equity
interests held in Seller without regard to whether any such profit
participation has been or is reflected in the Company Financial Statements.

 

SECTION 6.06. _Transfer Taxes._ All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes incurred in connection
with the Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by Purchaser. To
the extent applicable Law requires Seller to pay any Transfer Taxes, Purchaser
shall promptly reimburse Seller for such Transfer Taxes. 

SECTION 6.07. _Tax Returns._

(a) Seller shall prepare or caused to be prepared and timely file or cause to
be timely filed, taking into account valid extensions of time within which to
file, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed with respect to the
Company or the Company Subsidiary on or before the Closing Date. Seller shall
remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.
Subject to Section 6.07(b), Purchaser shall prepare all other Tax Returns
that are required to be filed with respect to the Company or the Company
Subsidiary.

(b) In the case of any Tax Return that is due after the Closing Date, that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an indemnity claim under Section
9.01(d) (or under Section 9.01(b) with respect to a breach of any
representation or warranty in Section 3.09), Purchaser shall prepare all such
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past custom and practice of the
Company or the Company Subsidiary, as applicable. Seller shall have the right
to review, comment on and make changes to each such Tax Return. Purchaser
shall thereafter execute and timely file each such Tax Return and timely remit
such Taxes, and Purchaser shall then be entitled to file any applicable
indemnity claims under Section 9.01(d) (or under Section 9.01(b) with respect
to a breach of any representation or warranty in Section 3.09).

SECTION 6.08. _Assistance and Cooperation._  To the extent reasonably
requested by Seller or Purchaser, after the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser
shall (and shall cause their respective affiliates to) (i) assist the other
party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible for
preparing and filing in accordance with Section 6.07, and (ii) cooperate fully
in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with any Tax authority regarding,
any Tax Returns of the Company or the Company Subsidiary. 

SECTION 6.09. _Computation of Tax Liabilities._ To the extent permitted or
required by Law, any applicable taxable period of the Company and the Company
Subsidiary which includes the Closing Date shall be treated as closing on (and
including) the Closing Date. For purposes of Section 9.01(d), with respect to
Taxes of a Straddle Period (which is not treated under the immediately
preceding sentence as closing on the

 



37  Closing Date), Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be computed (a) in the case of Taxes (such as real or
personal property Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis, based on the number of
days of the Straddle Period that are in the period ending on the Closing Date
and (b) in the case of all other Taxes, as if such taxable period ended at the
close of the Closing Date.

 

SECTION 6.10. _Indemnification._ (a) From and after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the Company
and the Company Subsidiary to honor all the CompanyÂ’s and the Company
SubsidiaryÂ’s obligations to indemnify (including all obligations to advance
funds for expenses) the current or former directors or officers of
the Company or the Company Subsidiary for acts or omissions by such directors
and officers occurring prior to the Closing Date to the extent that such
obligations of the Company or the Company Subsidiary exist on the date of this
Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the
charter or bylaws of the Company Subsidiary, individual indemnity agreements
or otherwise, and such obligations shall survive the Transactions and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with the current terms of the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the charter or bylaws of the Company
Subsidiary and such individual indemnity agreements from the Closing Date
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to
any claims against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or
omissions.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Company and
the Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date to obtain and fully pay the
premium for the extension of the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability coverage
of the CompanyÂ’s and the Company SubsidiaryÂ’s existing directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ insurance policies, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six years from and after the Closing Date with respect to any claim
related to any period of time at or prior to the Closing Date from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the CompanyÂ’s or
the Company SubsidiaryÂ’s, as the case may be, current insurance carrier with
respect to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance (collectively, " _D
andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are no less advantageous than the coverage provided under the CompanyÂ’s
or the Company SubsidiaryÂ’s existing policies with respect to any actual or
alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect,
breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the
Company or the Company Subsidiary by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Closing Date (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.10(b) more than an amount in
excess of 175% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement. If the Company or the Company Subsidiary for any reason fails to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
cause the Company and the Company Subsidiary to continue to maintain in effect
for a period of at least six years from the Closing Date the DandO Insurance
with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which
occurred at or before the Closing Date.

 



38 SECTION 6.11. _Indebtedness._ (a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall cause
the Company to pay, by wire transfer of cash in immediately available funds
pursuant to written instructions and amounts specified by Seller in a written
notice to be provided by Seller to Purchaser at least three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date to the administrative agent under the CES Credit
Agreement or any Indebtedness incurred to refinance or replace the CES Credit
Agreement (the " _CES Credit Agreement Repayment Amount_ "), for the account
of the lenders of such Indebtedness immediately following the Closing against
delivery by such administrative agent of documentation, in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, evidencing the release as of the Closing of (i) the
Company from its obligations under such Indebtedness and (ii) the Liens
created by such Indebtedness and related security agreements on the capital
stock of the Company and all collateral owned by the Company or the Company
Subsidiary. For income tax purposes, the parties agree to report the
transaction occurring pursuant to the preceding sentence as follows:
Immediately prior to the Closing, (x) Purchaser shall be treated as paying the
CES Credit Agreement Repayment Amount to Seller, (y) Seller shall then be
treated as making a capital contribution to the Company in the amount of the
CES Credit Agreement Repayment Amount and (z) the Company shall then be
treated as paying the CES Credit Agreement Repayment Amount to the
administrative agent for the account of the lenders of such Indebtedness.

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to the administrative agent under
the NMGC Credit Agreement or any Indebtedness incurred to refinance or replace
the NMGC Credit Agreement, for the account of the lenders of such Indebtedness
and on behalf of the Company Subsidiary, by wire transfer of cash in
immediately available funds pursuant to written instructions and amounts
specified in a written notice to be provided by the Company, on behalf of the
Company Subsidiary, to Purchaser at least three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, an amount equal to such Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the Closing Date (the " _NMGC Credit Agreement Repayment
Amount_ ") to pay such Indebtedness and against customary payoff
documentation, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, that provides
for release of any further liability or obligation with respect to such
Indebtedness and termination of any Liens in favor of the holders of such
Indebtedness to the extent such Liens do not also secure the NMGC Notes. 

(c) Prior to the date that is 30 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause NMGC to, give written notice of the consummation of the
Transactions to the holders of NMGCÂ’s 4.87% senior secured notes due February
8, 2021 (the " _NMGC Notes_ "), make an offer to prepay the Notes as provided
in section 8.3 of the Note Purchase Agreement dated February 8, 2011, by and
among NMGC and the noteholder parties thereto (the " _NMGC Note Purchase
Agreement_ "), and thereafter prepay each NMGC Note validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to such offer, in each case in accordance with the
provisions of the NMGC Note Purchase Agreement.

SECTION 6.12. _Fees and Expenses._  Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the fees payable to a Governmental Entity in connection with
filings under applicable antitrust

 



39  Laws shall be shared equally by the Company and Purchaser, whether or not
the Closing occurs; _provided_ , _further_ , that all filing fees and expenses
(except expenses of legal counsel of each of Seller and the Company) payable
in connection with the Required Regulatory Approvals shall be paid by
Purchaser, whether or not the Closing occurs.

SECTION 6.13. _FIRPTA Certificate._ Seller shall deliver to Purchaser at the
Closing a certificate, duly completed and executed, certifying that it is not
a foreign person. Such certificate shall be substantially in the form of the
sample set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B).

SECTION 6.14.  _Insurance._ Purchaser acknowledges that the Company and the
Company Subsidiary shall not be entitled to coverage under any insurance
policies maintained by Seller or its affiliates (other than directly by the
Company and the Company Subsidiary) from and after the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall provide recovery to the Company or
a Company Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Company Insurance
Policies, or any other historical insurance policy, including all those
insurance policies referenced in the last sentence of Section 3.17 of this
Agreement, (at no cost to Seller or any of its affiliates) retained from a
third-party to insure the Company or the Company Subsidiary for any
claims made or Losses incurred prior to the Closing Date that relate to the
Company or the Company Subsidiary if such claim was reported or made against
the Company Insurance Policies or such other insurance policies prior to the
Closing or if the Company Insurance Policies or such other insurance policies
(at no cost to the Seller or any of its affiliates) permit the Company or a
Company Subsidiary to pursue such claim after the Closing even if it was not
reported or made prior to the Closing (such claim and Losses, collectively,
the " _Recoverable Insurance Claims_ "). To the extent any Recoverable
Insurance Claim is subject to indemnification by Seller under Article IX of
this Agreement, in accordance with Section 9.06(b), any payment by the Seller
under Article IX shall be net of any payments received by the Company or the
Company Subsidiary pursuant to the Company Insurance Policies or such other
insurance policies.

 

SECTION 6.15. _Settlement of Intercompany Notes; Affiliate Transactions._
Seller shall take (or cause to be taken) all action necessary such that (i)
all intercompany loans for borrowed money evidenced by notes between and among
the Company and the Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Seller and
SellerÂ’s subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiary), on
the other hand, shall be eliminated (which may include the netting of
receivables and payables, contributions to equity and dividends) and (ii) all
Contracts by and between the Seller or its affiliates (other than the
Company and the Company Subsidiary), on the one hand, and the Company or the
Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be terminated, in each case,
prior to the Closing and without any further liability on the part of the
parties thereto.

 

SECTION 6.16. _Financing._ (a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Financing on the terms
and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) set forth in the Financing
Commitment, including using 

 



40  its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing
Commitment and, if entered into prior to the Closing, the definitive
documentation with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitment (the " _Definitive Financing Documentation_ "), (ii) negotiate and
enter into the Definitive Financing Documentation on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) that are not materially less favorable, in
the aggregate, to Seller than those contained in the Financing Commitments
and, upon execution thereof, deliver correct and complete copies thereof to
Seller, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Purchaser set forth therein that are within its control, (iv) consummate the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment at or prior to the Closing,
including, subject to Section 10.09, using its reasonable best efforts to
take actions (which may include litigation) to enforce its rights under the
Financing Commitment and the Definitive Financing Documentation and to cause
the Debt Financing Sources and any other persons providing such Financing
to fund the Financing required to consummate the Transactions at the Closing,
and (v) comply in all material respects with its covenants and other
obligations under the Financing Commitment and the Definitive Financing
Documentation, in each case, for so long as Purchaser does not have
sufficient cash from other sources (including by reason of a capital market,
equity or other financing transactions) available to satisfy its obligations
under this Agreement. In the event that Purchaser commences an action to seek
specific performance to enforce its rights under the Financing Commitment or
the Definitive Financing Documentation or cause the Debt Financing Sources to
fund the Financing (any such action, a " _Financing Action_ "), Purchaser
shall (x) keep Seller reasonably informed of the status of the Financing
Action and (y) at the reasonable request of Seller, make PurchaserÂ’s employees
and legal advisors reasonably available to discuss the status of, and
material developments with respect to, the Financing Action (subject in all
cases to preserving all legal privileges). In the event that any portion of
the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including
any applicable "flex" provisions) set forth in the Financing Commitment, or
Purchaser becomes aware of any event or circumstance that could reasonably be
expected to make any portion of the Financing unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any applicable "flex" provisions) contemplated in the
Financing Commitment, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any such portion from alternative sources,
on terms that will still enable Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller true and complete
copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall
have committed to provide Purchaser with any portion of the Financing.
Purchaser shall refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that
would reasonably be expected to result in a failure or material delay of any
of the conditions contained in the Financing Commitment or in any Definitive
Financing Documentation. Purchaser shall not agree to or permit any amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its
rights under or terminate, the Financing Commitment or the Definitive
Financing Documentation in any manner that is reasonably expected to impair,
delay or prevent the funding or Financing described therein or the occurrence
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, without
SellerÂ’s prior written consent; _provided_ , that Purchaser may (x) amend,
supplement, modify or replace the Financing Commitment and 

 



41  (y) replace all or a portion of the facility committed under the Financing
Commitment as in effect as of the date hereof with one or more debt or equity
financing in a manner that does not impair, delay or prevent the funding of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall keep Seller
reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to
arrange, obtain and consummate the Financing. Purchaser shall give Seller
oral and written notice promptly after Purchaser becomes aware (i) of the
occurrence of any material breach, default or repudiation by any party to the
Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Documentation or of any
condition therein being not likely to be satisfied, (ii) of the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication from any source of Financing
with respect to any (A) actual or potential material breach, default,
termination or repudiation of any provisions of the Financing Commitment or
the Definitive Financing Documentation, in each case by any party thereto, or
(B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the
Financing Commitment or the Definitive Financing Documentation, (iii) of any
termination or material waiver, amendment or other modification of the
Financing Commitment or the Definitive Financing Documentation, (iv) that any
of the parties to the Financing Commitment no longer intends to provide the
Financing, (v) that any portion of the Financing is not available to
consummate the Transactions or (vi) the occurrence of any event or development
that Purchaser determines could reasonably be expected to adversely impact
the ability of Purchaser to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitment and the Definitive Financing
Documentation on terms and conditions, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Financing Commitment or the Definitive Financing
Documentation (or if at any time for any other reason Purchaser believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment and the Definitive
Financing Documentation on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by any of the Financing Commitments or the Definitive
Financing Documentation). As soon as reasonably practicable, Purchaser shall
provide any information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any
circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. Purchaser
acknowledges that its obligation to consummate the Transactions is
not conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the Financing.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide, shall cause the
Company Subsidiary to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause any attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative
(collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") retained by the Company or the
Company Subsidiary to provide, in each case subject to Section 6.16, such
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
(including any offering or private placement of debt securities pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933) as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser, including (i) participation in a reasonable number of meetings,
drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii) using reasonable best
efforts to furnish Purchaser and its Debt Financing Sources with financial
and other pertinent information regarding the Company and the Company
Subsidiary as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to consummate the
Financing, (iii) reasonably assisting Purchaser and its Debt Financing
Sources in the preparation of (A) customary offering documents or memoranda
(or similar documents) for any portion of the Financing and (B) materials for
rating

 



42  agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts
of Purchaser and its Debt Financing Sources for any portion of the Financing,
(v) executing and delivering (or using reasonable best efforts to obtain),
and causing its affiliates to execute and deliver (or use reasonable best
efforts to obtain), customary certificates, accountantsÂ’ comfort letters,
consents, opinions and negative assurance letters and (vi) obtaining
customary payoff letters and instruments of discharge contemplated by Section
6.11; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or the
Company Subsidiary be required to (1) pledge any assets as collateral, pay
any commitment or other similar fee, bear any cost or expense or incur any
other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing, (2)
take any actions to the extent such actions would, in the
CompanyÂ’s reasonable judgment, unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
business or operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiary or otherwise
interfere with the prompt and timely discharge by the CompanyÂ’s or the Company
SubsidiaryÂ’s employees of their normal duties in any material respect or (3)
take any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result
in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, any applicable
Laws or any Material Contract. Seller hereby consents to the reasonable use of
SellerÂ’s and its affiliatesÂ’ logos in connection with the Financing, provided
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage Seller or any of its affiliates or the
reputation or goodwill of Seller or any of its affiliates or any of their
logos and on such other customary terms and conditions as Seller shall
reasonably impose.

(c) Purchaser shall be responsible for all fees and expenses related to
the Financing contemplated hereby. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in Section 6.12, Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Seller, the
Company or the Company Subsidiary, as applicable, for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred by
Seller, the Company or the Company Subsidiary in connection with such
cooperation or otherwise in connection with the Financing. Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Company, the Company Subsidiary and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiary set forth in
this Agreement or the exhibits or schedules hereto or provided to Purchaser in
writing on or behalf of Seller, its subsidiaries or its and their
Representatives, in each case if expressly provided for use in connection
with the Financing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Seller shall not have any liability or obligation under any loan
agreement or any related document or any other agreement or document related
to the Financing or any alternative financing.

(d) Purchaser shall refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action
that would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of any of the
conditions contained in the Financing Commitment or in any definitive
agreement relating to the Financing. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that,
notwithstanding the CompanyÂ’s obligations under Section 6.16(b), none of the
obtaining of the Financing or any alternative financing or the completion of
any issuance of securities contemplated by the 

 



43  Financing are a condition to the Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently of the availability
of the Financing or any alternative financing or the completion of any such
issuance, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 and
7.02.

ARTICLE VIII

_Termination, Amendment and Waiver_

prior to the Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

(b) by either Seller or Purchaser, by written notice to the other:

 

(i) if the Closing has not occurred on or before May 25, 2014 (the " _Outside
Date_ ") so long as, on the Outside Date and the date of such notice, (A) the
terminating party (or the Company, if Seller is the terminating party) has not
failed to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement which failure has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur, and (B) it
is not the case that the conditions to the

 



46  Closing set forth in Sections 7.01(c) and 7.01(d) have not been fulfilled
but all other conditions to the Closing have been fulfilled or are capable of
being fulfilled, in which case the Outside Date will be September 25, 2014;

(ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction has issued an
order, decree or ruling or takes any other action permanently enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions and such order, decree,
ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or

 

(iii) if any condition to the obligation of such party to consummate the
Closing set forth in Section 7.02 (in the case of Purchaser) or 7.03 (in the
case of Seller) becomes incapable of satisfaction prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the terminating party (or the Company, if Seller
is the terminating party) is not then in breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement;

(c) by Purchaser, if (i) Seller or the Company has breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, in any case, such that a condition contained in
Section 7.02(a), 7.02(b), 7.02(c) or 7.02(d) is not reasonably capable of
being satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall have delivered to Seller written notice
of such breach or failure to perform; and (iii) either (A) such breach or
failure to perform is not capable of cure or (B) at least 30 days shall have
elapsed since the date of delivery of such written notice to Seller and such
breach or failure to perform shall not have been cured; _provided_ , _however_
, that Purchaser shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.01(c) if Purchaser has breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement;

 

(d) by Seller, if (i) Purchaser has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, in any case, such that a condition contained in Section 7.03(a) or
7.03(b) is not reasonably capable of being satisfied; (ii) Seller shall have
delivered to Purchaser written notice of such breach or failure to perform;
and (iii) either (A) such breach or failure to perform is not capable of cure

to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) if Seller or the
Company has breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination._  In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Seller or Purchaser as provided in Section 8.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the 

 



47  part of any party, other than Section 2.06, Section 3.18, Section 4.04,
Section 4.05, the last sentence of Section 6.01, Section 6.12, Section
6.16(c), this Section 8.02 and Article X and the Confidentiality Agreement,
all of which shall survive such termination, and except to the extent that
such termination results from a knowing and intentional breach by a party of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 8.02 shall be deemed to release any party
from any liability for any breach by such party of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement or to impair the right of any party to compel specific
performance by any other party of its obligations under this Agreement.

SECTION 8.03.  _Amendment._ This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Sections 9.08(c), 10.06, the last
sentence of Section 10.09(b) and this Section 8.03 (and any provision of this
Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) may
not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse
in any respect to a Debt Financing Source without the prior written consent of
such Debt Financing Source.

SECTION 8.04. _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Closing Date, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _Indemnification_

SECTION 9.01. _Indemnification by Seller._ From and after the Closing, Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, its affiliates (including the
Company and the Company Subsidiary) and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (" _Purchaser
Â’s Indemnified Persons_") from and against, and shall reimburse PurchaserÂ’s
Indemnified Persons for, any and all Losses directly arising out of or based
upon:

(a) any misrepresentation in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Seller set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement;

 



48 (b) any misrepresentation in or breach of any representation or warranty of
the Company set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement;

(c) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of Seller or, prior to the Closing, the Company set forth in this
Agreement; and

(d) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) (i) of the Company for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date (determined in accordance with the principles of
Section 6.09), but in each case only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the
accrual or reserve for Taxes taken into account in computing the Working
Capital or (ii) attributable to any entity other than the Company or the
Company Subsidiary but imposed on the Company or the Company Subsidiary
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision
of any Tax Laws).

SECTION 9.02. _Indemnification by Purchaser._ From and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its affiliates and each
of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives (" _Seller Â’s Indemnified Persons_") from and against, and
shall reimburse Seller for, any and all Losses directly arising out of or
based upon:

(a) any misrepresentation in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement; and

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement.

SECTION 9.03. _Defense of Third Party Claims._

(a) If any legal proceedings shall be instituted or any claim is asserted by
any third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of which any party to
this Agreement may have an obligation to indemnify another party to this
Agreement, the party asserting such right to indemnity (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") shall give the party from whom indemnity is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice thereof within 10 Business Days after
receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim, but any
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party other than to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five
Business DaysÂ’ time after the Indemnified PartyÂ’s receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by
the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party,
to assume the defense thereof with

 



49  counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that such counsel is
not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in such defense but the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such
participation or otherwise in connection with the defense of such claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for such
legal expenses if the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that the
incurrence of the same is appropriate in light of defenses not available to
the Indemnifying Party, conflicts of interest or other similar circumstances.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party
Claim, all Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of such claim or ceasing
to defend against such claim (with such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms obligates
the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection
with such Third Party Claim, which releases the Indemnified Party completely
in connection with such Third Party Claim.

 

(e) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to,
or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

 

(f) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the defense of such
claim as provided in this Section 9.03, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to defend such Third Party Claim in such manner as it may deem
appropriate at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (other than
during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give
notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above), and the Indemnifying
Party will promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party therefor in accordance
with this Section 9.03. The reimbursement of fees, costs and expenses required
by this Section 9.03 shall be made by periodic payments during the course of
the investigations or defense, as and when bills are received or expenses
incurred.

SECTION 9.04. _Other Claims._ A claim for indemnification for any matter not
involving a Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party to
the 

 



50  Indemnifying Party in writing with reasonable promptness, setting forth
specifically the obligation with respect to which the claim is made, the facts
giving rise to and the alleged basis for such claim and, if known or
reasonably ascertainable, the amount of the liability asserted or which may be
asserted by reason thereof, but any failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party other than to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is actually prejudiced thereby. In the event the Indemnifying Party disputes
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Article IX,
the Indemnifying Party shall have 60 days after receipt of notice under this
Section 9.04 to give written notice of such objection, and the grounds
therefor, and the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have 30 days to respond
in writing to the objection of the Indemnifying Party. If after such 30-day
period there remains a dispute as to any obligation, the parties shall attempt
in good faith for 30 days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to such indemnification obligation.

SECTION 9.05. _Survival._

 

(a) The representations and warranties of each party contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period ending on the date that is
nine months after the Closing Date (the " _Survival Expiration Date_ "), at
which time such representations and warranties shall terminate and thereafter
be of no force and effect. Any claim for indemnity under Section 9.01 or
Section 9.02 must be asserted in writing prior to or on the Survival
Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , each covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing shall survive in
accordance with its terms.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.05(a), a partyÂ’s rights to indemnification under
this Article IX, and the other provisions of this Article IX, shall not
terminate with respect to any claim with respect to which the Indemnified
Party has delivered a written notice to the Indemnifying Party prior to
Survival Expiration Date, alleging in good faith a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant or other right to indemnification and
setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for indemnification, the facts
upon which the claim for indemnification is based and an estimate in
reasonable detail of the Losses incurred in connection therewith; _provided_ ;
_however_ , that the applicable representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or right to indemnification under this Article IX shall survive only until,
and only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such
notice.

SECTION 9.06. _Indemnification Limitations._  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

(a) Other than (i) with respect to Losses attributable to breaches of the
representations and warranties set forth in the Fundamental Representations,
(ii) with respect to Losses attributable to breaches or nonfulfillment of any
covenant or agreement to be performed after the Closing, (iii) with respect
to Losses attributable to breaches or nonfulfillment of any covenant,
agreement or other obligation set forth in Section 6.05(g), 6.05(h) or 6.15,
(iv) with respect to Losses arising under Section 9.01(d)(ii) or 

 



51  (v) in the case of fraud: (w) neither PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified Persons nor
SellerÂ’s Indemnified Persons may assert any claim for Losses under Sections
9.01 or 9.02, as applicable, (A) except to the extent that any such claim is
in an amount in excess of $50,000 (the " _Claim Threshold_ "), and (B) unless
and until the aggregate amount of all such claims by such PurchaserÂ’s
Indemnified Persons or SellerÂ’s Indemnified Persons, as applicable, under
this Agreement exceeds $9,250,000 (Nine Million, Two Hundred and Fifty
Thousand) (the " _Deductible_ "), and then PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified Persons or
SellerÂ’s Indemnified Persons, as applicable, may assert claims only for the
excess of such aggregate claims over the Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ ,
neither the Claim Threshold nor the Deductible shall apply to claims for
indemnification arising under Section 9.01(b) (with respect to Losses
attributable to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.09) or Section 9.01(d)(i), (x) in no event shall the aggregate
liability of Seller for all claims of Losses under Section 9.01 exceed the
Escrow Amount minus the amount, if any, paid to Purchaser out of the Escrow
Fund pursuant to Section 1.04(d)(ii), (y) any and all payments of any
indemnification obligations to any PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified Person under this
Article IX shall be made solely and exclusively from the funds, if any, then
constituting the Escrow Fund, and (z) any PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified PersonÂ’s
sole recourse for indemnity in respect of any Loss under this Article IX
shall be limited solely and exclusively to the funds, if any, then
constituting the Escrow Fund. The aggregate amount of Losses for which the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall be indemnified by Seller for any claim
for indemnification under Section 9.01 shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

(b) The Indemnified Persons shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate all Losses for which such Indemnified Persons are entitled or may be
entitled to indemnification under this Article IX, and no Indemnified Person
shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses to the extent arising
from such Indemnified PersonÂ’s failure to mitigate such Losses. The amount of
any Losses for which indemnification is provided for under this Article IX
shall be (i) offset by any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Persons as a
result of any indemnification by any third party and any insurance proceeds or
other amounts received by the Indemnified Persons from third parties with
respect to such Losses, (ii) reduced to take account of any tax benefit
realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such Loss, in each case on a "with and without" basis and (iii) reduced by
any amounts recovered through any rate order issued by the New Mexico Public
Regulation Commission. Purchaser and Seller agree to (and agree to cause the
other Indemnified Persons to) use commercially reasonable efforts to make any
claims for insurance and/or indemnification available from any third party
and/or pursue and comply with any rate order with respect to Losses for which
any Indemnified Person will or may seek indemnification hereunder and to
diligently pursue such claims in good faith. If any such insurance proceeds
and/or other amounts are received and/or authorized for deferred accounting
by any PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified Person after receipt of any indemnification
payment pursuant to this Article IX, Purchaser shall promptly repay to Seller
such portion of such indemnification payment equal to the amounts so
recovered or realized. Nothing in this Section 9.06(b) shall be construed to
require an Indemnified Party to apply for rate recovery in any case where rate
recovery is barred by law or by an order, or where, after consultation in good
faith in anticipation of an application, the staff of the appropriate
regulatory agency

 



52  indicates that it would be disposed to reject such a request for rate
recovery. Where an Indemnified Party is not obligated to apply for rate
recovery under the preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party shall not be
deemed to have failed to mitigate Losses under this Section 9.06(b) as a
result of a failure to apply for rate recovery.

(c) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to Section 9.01 or 9.02 shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by a final determination (which shall include the
execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form).

(d) The amount of the Loss arising out of any item included as a liability in
calculating Working Capital shall be calculated net of the amount so included.
The amount of the Loss arising out of any reduction in value of any Current
Asset acquired at the Closing shall be calculated net of the reported value
of such Current Asset used in calculating Working Capital. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX for any
Losses to the extent such Losses are reflected in Closing Indebtedness or in
Closing Working Capital.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the
PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified Persons nor the SellerÂ’s Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to indemnification under this Article IX with respect to any losses,
liabilities, damages or expenses that are in the nature of punitive (except
to the extent payable to third parties), consequential, special, treble or
indirect damages or damages based on any multiple, including business
interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or income, or loss of business
reputation or opportunity, in each case of any kind or nature, regardless of
the form of action through which any of the foregoing are sought.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no PurchaserÂ’s
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX
with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
Seller or the Company attributable to an event occurring or a matter arising
after the date of this Agreement (or, in the case of events or matters that
are based on SellerÂ’s or the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, such events or matters that
first come to SellerÂ’s or the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge after the date hereof), only
if all of the following occur: (i) Seller provides written notice to Purchaser
no less than 20 days prior to the Closing, describing in detail such breach
or inaccuracy, (ii) as a result of such breach or inaccuracy, a condition
contained in Section 7.02(a), Section 7.02(b) or Section 7.02(e) would not be
satisfied, (iii) Seller or the Company simultaneously and irrevocably informs
Purchaser in writing that Purchaser is not required to consummate the
Transactions and (iv) the Closing occurs.

(g) For purposes of determining the Loss attributable to a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, the terms "Company Material Adverse
Effect," "Seller Material Adverse Effect," "Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect," "material adverse effect," "material" or other terms of a similar
nature, to the extent contained in such representation or warranty, shall be
given no effect and shall be disregarded in their entirety.

 



53 SECTION 9.07. _Release of Escrow Fund._

 

(a) On the fifth Business Day following the Survival Expiration Date,
Purchaser shall provide to Seller (i) a written notice of its reasonable and
good faith determination of the Projected Indemnity Amount, together with
reasonable supporting calculations and documentation, and (ii) a written
notice duly executed by Purchaser instructing the Escrow Agent to release
an amount of cash from the Escrow Fund equal to the amount by which the
amount of the Escrow Fund as of the Survival Expiration Date exceeds the
Projected Indemnity Amount so determined by Purchaser (such notice, the "
_Expiration Date Release Notice_ "). Seller shall promptly execute the
Expiration Date Release Notice following receipt and delivery of the same to
the Escrow Agent, whereupon the Escrow Agent will release the relevant funds
from the Escrow Fund. Promptly following resolution of all claims for
indemnification from the Escrow Fund that were pending as of the Survival
Expiration Date, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
to release all cash then constituting the Escrow Fund. The term " _Projected
Indemnity Amount_ " means the maximum aggregate amount of Losses that, as of
the Survival Expiration Date, would reasonably be expected to be (i)
indemnified by the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Article IX in respect
of claims that have been timely asserted but not finally resolved by such
date or (ii) paid to Purchaser from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section
1.04(d)(ii) pending determination of a final Statement that is binding on
Seller and Purchaser in accordance with Section 1.04. Anything to the
contrary in the foregoing notwithstanding, the execution and delivery of an
Expiration Date Release Notice by Seller shall not prevent or otherwise impair
Seller from disputing the Projected Indemnity Amount or any liability in
respect of claims included in the determination of the Projected Indemnity
Amount.

(b) If all or any portion of the Escrow Fund is released as provided in
Section 9.07(a), Seller and Purchaser shall, with respect to any such release,
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Seller the amount released from
the Escrow Fund. 

SECTION 9.08. _Exclusive Remedy._

(a) Except (i) as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, (ii) with
respect to Losses attributable to breaches or nonfulfillment of any covenant
or agreement to be performed after the Closing, (iii) with respect to Losses
attributable to breaches or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation set forth in Section 6.05(g), 6.05(h) or 6.15, (iv) with respect to
Losses arising under Section 9.01(d)(ii) or (v) in the case of fraud, each
party to this Agreement acknowledges that its sole and exclusive remedy after
the Closing with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement and
the Transactions, the Company or the Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective assets and liabilities shall, in each case, be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX and in no event shall
Seller have any right to contribution, subrogration or other recovery from
the Company or the Company Subsidiary with respect to any Losses of a
Purchaser Indemnified Person to be

 



54  paid by Seller pursuant to this Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each of Purchaser and the Company hereby waives, from and after the Closing,
any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against Seller,
and Seller hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action it may have against Purchaser, Company or the
Company Subsidiary, in each case arising under or based upon this Agreement,
any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, any applicable
Law or Judgment (including any rights of contribution or recovery under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act or
any analogous state law, or any Environmental Law), common law or otherwise
except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
IX.

(b) After the Closing, no party may bring any suit, action or proceeding
seeking to rescind the Transactions or this Agreement, whether based on fraud,
gross negligence, negligence, breach of contract, breach of statute or
otherwise.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Debt Financing Sources will have any liability to Seller or its affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing or otherwise,
whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither
Seller nor any of its affiliates will have any rights or claims against any
of the Debt Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder, and in no event shall
Seller be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this
Agreement against the Debt Financing Sources.

effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 

SECTION 10.05. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

SECTION 10.06. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This
Agreement, as amended or supplemented from time to time, and all Disclosure
Letters, Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes attached hereto, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement , (a) constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the Transactions and (b) except for Section
6.10, the rights of the Company Subsidiary, the respective Representatives of
Seller, the Company and the Company Subsidiary set forth in Section 6.16(c),
and Sections 8.03, 9.08(c), 10.06 and the last sentence of Section 10.09(b)
with respect to any Debt Financing Source, is not intended to confer upon any
person other than the parties any rights or remedies.

SECTION 10.07. _Governing Law._ This Agreement, and all matters, claims or
causes of action (whether in contract or tort) based upon, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. 

 



61 SECTION 10.08. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 10.09. _Enforcement; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process._ (a)
The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Delaware Court of Chancery or any Federal court located in the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that
right, none of Seller, the Company or Purchaser would have entered into this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 10.09 shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with any such order or injunction, and the
party opposing such injunction or injunctions hereby agrees that it shall not
contest the amount or absence of any such bond or other security requested or
offered by the party seeking such injunction or injunctions.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or any Federal court located
in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement
or the Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than the Delaware Court of
Chancery or any Federal court located in the State of Delaware, (iv)
waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, (v) waives the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action related to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions and (vi) consents to service of
process being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 10.01.
The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware. The parties
hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced

 



62  in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 10.09(b), each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that it will not
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Financing Commitment or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, (ii)
waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any such action or claim,
and (iii) agrees that any such action or claim shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to conflicts of law rules that would result in the application of the
laws of any other state.

SECTION 10.10. _Purchaser Acknowledgement._  (a) Purchaser is knowledgeable
about the business engaged in by the Company and the Company Subsidiary and of
the usual and customary practices of companies engaged in businesses similar
to such business. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the representations
and warranties set forth in Articles II and III constitute the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of Seller and the Company to
Purchaser in connection with the Transactions, and there are no
other representations, warranties, covenants, understandings or agreements,
oral or written, in relation thereto between the parties other than those
incorporated therein. Except for the representations and warranties expressly
set forth in Articles II and III, Purchaser disclaims reliance on any
representations or warranties, either express or implied, by or on behalf of
Seller, the Company or the Company Subsidiary or their affiliates or
representatives.

 

(b) Purchaser represents that it is a sophisticated party. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that any financial forecasts or projections relating
to the Company and the Company Subsidiary prepared by or on behalf of the
Company or Seller have been provided to Purchaser with the understanding and
agreement that neither the Company nor Seller is making any representation or
warranty with respect to such forecasts or projections and that actual future
results may vary from such forecasts or projections based upon numerous
factors.

SECTION 10.11. _Affiliate Liability._ Each of the following is herein
referred to as a " _Company Affiliate_ ": any director, officer or employee of
(i) the Company or the Company Subsidiary or (ii) any person who controls the
Company or the Company Subsidiary. Other than Seller as specifically provided
for herein, no Company Affiliate shall have any personal liability or personal
obligation to Purchaser of any nature whatsoever in connection with or under
this Agreement, and Purchaser hereby waives and releases all claims of any
such liability and obligation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
waiver and release shall not apply to claims and obligations for liability
arising under the reimbursement obligations under Section 6.10.
