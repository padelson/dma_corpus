limited liability company ("Seller"), INNOSPEC OIL FIELD CHEMICALS, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company ("Buyer"), and INNOSPEC INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Innospec").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding membership interests
(the "Membership Interests") in Independence Oilfield Chemicals, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company ("Company");

WHEREAS, Company owns all of the issued and outstanding membership interests
in IOC Atascosa FM536, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("Sub"); and

WHEREAS, Seller wishes to sell to Buyer, and Buyer wishes to purchase from
Seller, all of the Membership Interests, subject to, and in accordance with,
the terms and conditions set forth herein;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS 

Except as otherwise provided herein, all capitalized terms used herein shall
have the meanings assigned to them in Exhibit A. 

ARTICLE II

 

PURCHASE AND SALE



   Section 2.1 | Purchase and Sale. 
---|--- 

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, at the Closing, Seller
shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, all right, title
and interest in and to the Membership Interests, free and clear of all
Encumbrances.

 



   Section 2.2 | Purchase Price; Payments at Closing. 
---|--- 

(a) _Purchase Price_. The aggregate consideration payable by Buyer (the
"Purchase Price") shall be:

(i) the Final Enterprise Value; 

(ii) _plus_ , the Final Closing Cash;

 

(iii) _minus_ , any Company Indebtedness outstanding at the Closing (other
than any current liabilities included in the calculation of NWC pursuant to
Section 2.5);

(iv) _minus_ , Company Transaction Expenses;

 



1 (v) minus, the amount by which the Final NWC is less than the Target NWC, or
plus the amount by which the Final NWC is greater than the Target NWC; and

(vi) _plus_ , any Deferred Consideration Payments as set forth in Section 2.3
below; and

The "Closing Date Purchase Price" shall be the sum of amounts described in
clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding sentence. The Closing Date Purchase
Price shall be estimated at the Closing in accordance with Section 2.2(c), and
the Estimated Closing Date Purchase Price shall be paid by the Buyer on the
Closing Date in accordance with Section 2.2(d). The Estimated Closing Date
Purchase Price is subject to adjustment after the Closing in accordance with
Section 2.5.

 

(b) _Stock Consideration_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.2 to the contrary,
(X) Buyer may elect to pay Seller a portion of the Deferred Consideration
Payments in Innospec Stock, valued at the Innospec Stock Value, for
distribution to and for the benefit of those Management Members identified on
Exhibit B, in accordance with Exhibit B and the Management Stock
Consideration Agreements, and pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited
Liability Company Agreement of Seller, as amended through the date hereof (the
"Seller LLC Agreement") and (Y) Buyer and Seller may mutually agree that
Seller shall receive up to 20% of the Deferred Consideration Payments in
Innospec Stock that are allocable to the interests of members of Seller other
than the Management Members (the "Non-Management Members"), valued at the
Innospec Stock Value (collectively, the "Stock Consideration"). For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will
the issuance of the Stock Consideration be of an amount that
requires Innospec shareholder approval under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(d).

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Innospec Stock Value" shall be
equal to the numerical average of the volume weighted average prices on NASDAQ
for one share of Innospec Stock for the ten consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the date of the Deferred Consideration Payment (with
respect to a Deferred Consideration Payment that includes Innospec Stock),
provided, however, that if, during such ten (10) trading day period, Buyer
pays a dividend in, splits, combines into a smaller number of shares, or
issues by reclassification any additional shares of Innospec Stock, then the
Innospec Stock Value shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to Seller the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action,
and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the
Innospec Stock Value.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no fractional shares of Innospec Stock
shall be issued.

(c) _Estimated Closing Date Purchase Price_. At least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause Company to prepare in consultation
with, and deliver to, Buyer, (i) a consolidated balance sheet of Company and
Sub estimated as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"),
(ii) a consolidated income statement of Company and Sub for the calendar month
of September 2014 (estimated if necessary for such month), prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistent with the manner of preparation of the
Financial Statements (the "Estimated Closing Income Statement"), and (iii) a
schedule and worksheet setting forth Companys good faith estimate of the
Closing Date Purchase Price (the "Estimated Closing Date

 



2  Purchase Price"), including: (A) a statement setting forth Companys good
faith estimate of the Closing Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash"),
Company Indebtedness outstanding as of the Closing (the "Estimated Closing
Indebtedness"), and Company Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses"), and (B) an estimated calculation of the Adjusted
EBITDA for the calendar month of September 2014 which shall be: (1) in the
form of and use the methodology reflected in the example Adjusted EBITDA
Statement set forth as Part 1 of Exhibit C hereto (the "Example
Adjusted EBITDA Statement") (with such form to be completed using financial
components that are determined in accordance with GAAP consistent with the
manner of preparation of the Financial Statements); (2) aggregated with the
Adjusted EBITDA for July and August 2014 for purposes of arriving at the
estimated calculation of the annualized Adjusted EBITDA for the Measurement
Period, and (3) include reasonable support for the calculations made therein.
For purposes of calculating the Estimated Closing Date Purchase Price, the
parties agree to use $1,919,000 for the Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar month
of July 2014 and $2,623,000 for the Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar month of
August 2014, as reflected in the Example Adjusted EBITDA Statement, which
Seller represents have been prepared using financial components that were
determined in accordance with GAAP consistent with the manner of preparation
of the Financial Statements. Company and Sub will permit Buyer and
its advisors and representatives reasonable access to the books, records and
other documents pertaining to or used in connection with the preparation of
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated Closing Income Statement, and
the schedule and worksheet setting forth the Estimated Purchase Price, each
of which shall be subject to Buyers reasonable approval. The Estimated
Closing Cash shall be added to the Closing Date Purchase Price and the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness and Estimated Company Transaction Expenses
shall each be subtracted from the Closing Date Purchase Price as provided in
Section 2.2(a).

 

(d) _Payment to Seller_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid
to Seller the Estimated Closing Date Purchase Price by wire transfer of
immediately available funds for the Closing Date Purchase Price.

(e) _Payment to Others_. At the Closing, Buyer shall also pay or cause to be
paid: (i) to each of the Advisors, on behalf of Company, their respective
portions of Company Transaction Expenses, if any, and (ii) to the lenders, on
behalf of Company, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness.



   Section 2.3 | Deferred Consideration Payments. 
---|--- 

(a) Within sixty (60) days following the end of each Deferred Consideration
Period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (a "Deferred Consideration
Statement") setting forth its calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and the Free Cash
Flow for such Deferred Consideration Period which: (1) shall be in the forms
of the Example Adjusted EBITDA Statement and the Example Free Cash Flow
Statement; (2) in the case of the Adjusted EBITDA, shall be prepared
consistent with the manner set forth in Section 2.2(c)(B), and in the case of
the Free Cash Flow, shall be prepared in accordance with the methodology
reflected in the Example Free Cash Flow Statement and to the extent consistent
therewith using financial components determined in accordance with GAAP; and
(3) shall include reasonable support for the calculation made therein, and its
determination of any Deferred Consideration Payment owed by Buyer to Seller.

 

(b) If Seller agrees with a Deferred Consideration Statement, it shall provide
written notice thereof to Buyer within thirty (30) days after its receipt of
such Deferred Consideration Statement. If Seller disagrees with a Deferred
Consideration Statement, Seller may, within thirty (30) days after its receipt
of such Deferred Consideration Statement, provide written notice

 



3  thereof to Buyer (the "Deferred Consideration Dispute Notice"), which shall
provide reasonable detail concerning each item that Seller disputes in such
Deferred Consideration Statement and include reasonable support for each such
position. During such 30-day period after its receipt of such Deferred
Consideration Statement and any subsequent time period in which the Deferred
Consideration Statement is being disputed as provided in this Section 2.3(b),
Buyer shall provide Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access,
upon reasonable advance written notice to Buyer, to the books, records and
working papers of Buyer and Company and Sub relating to the calculations
underlying the Deferred Consideration Statement, the personnel of Buyer,
Company, Sub, and, if applicable, the outside accountants of Buyer and Company
and Sub, in each case, who were involved in the preparation of the
Deferred Consideration Statement. If within the 30-day period following
delivery of a Deferred Consideration Statement, Seller provides Buyer with
written notice that Seller agrees with a Deferred Consideration Statement, or
if within such 30-day period Seller fails to deliver a Deferred Consideration
Dispute Notice, then in either of such circumstances, such Deferred
Consideration Statement shall then be conclusively deemed a "Final Deferred
Consideration Statement," and shall then be final and binding upon Buyer and
Seller for all purposes. For a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by
Buyer of a Deferred Consideration Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller shall use
good faith commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the disputed items set
forth in the Deferred Consideration Dispute Notice between themselves and, if
they are able to resolve all of such disputed items during such time period,
such Deferred Consideration Statement shall be revised to the extent
necessary to reflect such resolution, and as so revised shall be conclusively
deemed a "Final Deferred Consideration Statement," and shall be final and
binding upon Buyer, Company, Sub and Seller for all purposes, and the
Deferred Consideration Payment shall be made promptly by Buyer in accordance
with Section 2.3(c) below. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all of
the disputed items set forth in the Deferred Consideration Dispute Notice
within such 30-day period or such other period as they shall mutually agree
upon, and if the dispute is limited to issues that are primarily accounting in
nature, then they shall jointly engage Grant Thornton LLP (the "Independent
Accountants") and submit the disputed items to the Independent Accountants
for resolution. The (i) specific details, processes and procedures of the
dispute resolution process and (ii) the specific team of accountants that
shall review the disputed items and participate in the writing of the written
report referenced herein shall be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller and
set forth in the Independent Accountants engagement letter. The Independent
Accountants shall act as experts and not arbiters and shall determine only
those accounting items on the Deferred Consideration Statement being disputed
by Buyer and Seller as of the time of engagement of the Independent
Accountants. The Independent Accountants shall only decide the specific
accounting items under dispute and their decision for each disputed amount
must be within the range of values assigned to each item in the Deferred
Consideration Statement and the Deferred Consideration Dispute Notice.
Promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days after engagement of the
Independent Accountants, the Independent Accountants shall deliver a written
report to Buyer and Seller as to their resolution of the disputed items, which
shall include the resulting Deferred Consideration Statement incorporating
such resolutions. The Deferred Consideration Statement, as determined by the
Independent Accountants, shall be conclusively deemed the "Final Deferred
Consideration Statement" and shall, absent manifest error, be final and
binding upon Buyer, Company, Sub and Seller for all purposes. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountants incurred in connection with the
resolution of disputes pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be borne by Buyer
and Seller in proportion to the amounts of the disputed items on the Deferred
Consideration Dispute Notice, as compared to such items as determined by the
Independent Accountants and set forth on the applicable Final
Deferred Consideration Statement, with such fees and expenses to be paid by
Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, (as applicable) to the
Independent Accountants within five (5) Business Days after the Independent
Accountants determination.

 



4  Buyer and Seller each represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that
neither it, nor any of its Affiliates (i) engaged the Independent Accountants
during the two-year period prior to the date hereof, (ii) will engage the
Independent Accountants until such time as Seller and Buyer have mutually
agreed on another nationally recognized accounting firm to serve as the
Independent Accountants, or (iii) will engage the Independent Accountants
until after the Deferred Consideration Payment with respect to the Second
Deferred Consideration Period has been finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.3; provided that the engagement of the Independent Accountants
to serve in a capacity similar to the one envisioned by this Section 2.3 shall
not be deemed a breach of the preceding clauses (ii) or (iii).

 

(c) Based upon the Final Deferred Consideration Statement, Buyer shall
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days after it becomes
final) pay the following amount (each being a "Deferred Consideration
Payment") to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds and
Innospec Stock, for the benefit of the Management Members and in accordance
with the Seller LLC Agreement, if Stock Consideration is elected by Buyer, or
to Seller for the benefit of the Non-Management Members, if mutually agreed
upon by Buyer and Seller:

 

(i) For the First Deferred Consideration Period, an amount (but not less than
$0) equal to the sum of (x) 27% of the result obtained when the Adjusted
EBITDA for the First Deferred Consideration Period is multiplied by 7.5, and
(y) 49% of the Free Cash Flow for the First Deferred Consideration Period; and

 

(ii) For the Second Deferred Consideration Period, an amount (but not less
than $0) equal to the sum of (x) 22% of the result obtained when the Adjusted
EBITDA for the Second Deferred Consideration Period is multiplied by 7.5, and
(y) 22% of the Free Cash Flow for the Second Deferred Consideration Period.

 

(d) All Deferred Consideration Payments shall be subject to offset by Buyer
pursuant to the provisions of Article IX below. In the event a Loss claimed
by any of the Buyer Indemnitees has not been finally determined in accordance
with this Agreement when a Deferred Consideration Payment is otherwise due
hereunder, Buyer may retain such Deferred Consideration Payment or such
portion thereof that Buyer, in its commercially reasonable judgment, believes
in good faith is necessary to secure the payment of the undetermined Loss and
notify Seller in writing of such retention, or if Seller so demands in
writing, within twenty (20) Business Days following Sellers written demand,
Buyer shall deposit such amount in an Escrow Account, to be held in accordance
with the terms thereof until the date the Loss is finally determined. Once
the Loss, if any, is finally determined, if an Escrow Account has not been
established, Buyer shall offset such Loss against the retained Deferred
Consideration Payment, and the balance shall be thereafter promptly released
to Seller, plus interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum on the
amount released to Seller from the date any Deferred Consideration Payment is
retained by Buyer under this Section 2.3(d) to the date of release. If an
Escrow Account has been established pursuant to this Section 2.3(d), then
upon the final determination of the Loss, the parties will direct the escrow
agent to release to Buyer an amount equal to the sum of such Loss, plus
interest thereon (which shall be deemed an additional Loss incurred by Buyer)
at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date placed in escrow to the
date of release, with the balance being released to Seller. If Seller receives
payment from the Escrow Account, then Buyer shall further pay to Seller
interest with respect to such payment at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum
from the date such amount was placed in escrow to the date of Sellers receipt
thereof (but net of any interest earned with respect to the Escrow Account
that has been paid to Seller).

 



5 ---|--- 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Seller:

(i) the Estimated Closing Date Purchase Price payments called for in Section
2.2, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account of Seller
designated in writing by Seller to Buyer no later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date;

 

(ii) agreements for each Management Member respecting the potential issuance
of the Stock Consideration, in the form of Exhibit D hereto (the "Management
Stock Consideration Agreements"), duly executed by Innospec; and

 

(iii) the Transaction Documents and all other agreements, documents,
instruments or certificates required to be delivered by Buyer at or prior to
the Closing pursuant to Section 8.3 of this Agreement, all duly executed.

(b) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to
Buyer:

Sub;

 

(iii) the Management Stock Consideration Agreements, duly executed by each

transfer to Company of any Owned Intellectual Property owned by Seller or any
other asset owned by Seller that is necessary for Company to conduct its
business (the "Seller Assignment Documents"); and

 

(vi) the other Transaction Documents and all other agreements, documents,
instruments or certificates required to be delivered by Seller at or prior to
the Closing pursuant to Article VIII of this Agreement, all duly executed.



   Section 2.5 | Post-Closing Adjustments. 
---|--- 

(a) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Statement_. Within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a consolidated balance
sheet of Company and Sub as of the Closing (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), a
consolidated income statement for Company and Sub for the calendar month of
September 2014 (the "Closing Income Statement"), and a statement setting forth
the final Cash as of the Closing Date (the "Final Closing Cash"),
Company Indebtedness outstanding as of the Closing (the "Final Closing
Indebtedness"), Company Transaction Expenses as of the Closing (the "Final
Company Transaction Expenses"), and its calculation of (i) the
Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar month of September

 



6  2014, including reasonable support for the calculations made therein, (ii)
the annualized Adjusted EBITDA for the Measurement Period, including any
adjustments to the Adjusted EBITDA for July or August 2014, including
reasonable support for such calculations (any such adjustments to the July or
August 2014 Adjusted EBITDA being limited as set forth below); (iii) the NWC
as of the Closing, including reasonable support for the calculations made
therein, and (iv) the Closing Date Purchase Price, including reasonable
support for the calculations made therein (the "Post-Closing Purchase Price
Statement"). The Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Income Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistent with the manner of preparation of
the Financial Statements. The NWC as of the Closing shall be calculated using
the same methodology reflected in the form of the example NWC Statement set
forth as Part 2 of Exhibit C hereto (the "Example NWC Statement"), and the
Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar month of September 2014 shall be calculated
using the same methodology reflected in the Example Adjusted
EBITDA Statement; provided, that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Buyer and Seller agree that the Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar
months of July and August 2014 is $1,919,000 and $2,623,000, respectively, and
shall not be subject to adjustment except by Buyer in accordance herewith to
account for fraud or manifest error, or to correct for any financial
components that were not determined in accordance with GAAP applied in a
manner consistent with the manner of preparation of the Financial Statements.
If Seller agrees with the Post-Closing Statement, it shall provide written
notice thereof to Buyer within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Post-
Closing Statement. If Seller disagrees with the Post-Closing Statement,
Seller may, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Post-Closing
Statement, provide written notice thereof to Buyer (the "Purchase Price
Dispute Notice"), which shall provide reasonable detail concerning each item
that Seller disputes in the Post-Closing Statement and include reasonable
support for each such position. During such 30-day period after its receipt of
the Post-Closing Statement and any subsequent time period in which the Post-
Closing Statement is being disputed as provided in this Section 2.5(a), Buyer
shall provide Seller and its representatives with reasonable access, upon
reasonable advance written notice to Buyer, to the books, records and working
papers of Buyer, Company, and Sub relating to the calculations underlying the
Post-Closing Statement, the personnel of Buyer, Company, and Sub and, if
applicable, the outside accountants of Buyer, Company, and Sub in each case,
who were involved in the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement. If within
the 30-day period following delivery of a Post-Closing Statement, Seller
provides Buyer with written notice that Seller agrees with the Post-Closing
Statement, or if within such 30-day period Seller fails to deliver a Purchase
Price Dispute Notice, then in either of such circumstances, the Post-Closing
Statement shall then be conclusively deemed the "Final Post-Closing Purchase
Price Statement", and shall then be final and binding upon Buyer, Company,
Sub and Seller for all purposes. For a period of thirty (30) days after
receipt by Buyer of the Purchase Price Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller shall
use good faith commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the disputed items
set forth on the Purchase Price Dispute Notice between themselves and, if they
are able to resolve all of such disputed items during such time period, the
Post-Closing Purchase Price Statement shall be revised to the extent
necessary to reflect such resolution, and as so revised shall be conclusively
deemed the "Final Post-Closing Purchase Price Statement," and shall be final
and binding upon Buyer and Seller for all purposes, and any Post-Closing PP
Adjustment shall be promptly paid in accordance with Section 2.5(c) below. If
Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all of the disputed accounting items
set forth on the Purchase Price Dispute Notice within such thirty (30) day
period or such other period as they shall mutually agree upon, they shall
jointly engage the Independent Accountants and submit the disputed accounting
items to the Independent Accountants for resolution. The (i) the specific
details, processes and procedures of the dispute resolution process and (ii)
the specific team of accountants that shall review the disputed items and
participate in the writing of the written report referenced herein shall be
mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller and set forth in the

 



7  Independent Accountants engagement letter. The Independent Accountants
shall act as experts and not arbiters and shall determine only those
accounting items on the Post-Closing Purchase Price Statement being disputed
by Buyer and Seller as of the time of engagement of the Independent
Accountants. The Independent Accountants shall only decide the specific items
under dispute and their decision for each disputed amount must be within the
range of values assigned to each item in the Post-Closing Purchase Price
Statement and the Purchase Price Dispute Notice. Promptly, but no later than
thirty (30) days after engagement of the Independent Accountants, the
Independent Accountants shall deliver a written report to Buyer and Seller as
to their resolution of the disputed items, which shall include the resulting
Post-Closing Purchase Price Statement incorporating such resolutions. The
Post-Closing Purchase Price Statement, as determined by the Independent
Accountants, shall be conclusively deemed the "Final Post-Closing Purchase
Price Statement" and shall, absent manifest error, be final and binding upon
Buyer and Seller for all purposes. The final Cash, as of the Closing, as set
forth on the Final Post-Closing Purchase Price Statement is referred to herein
as the "Final Closing Cash;" the final Company Indebtedness outstanding as of
the Closing, as set forth on the Final Post-Closing Purchase Price Statement
is referred to herein as the "Final Company Indebtedness;" the final Company
Transaction Expenses, as set forth on the Final Post-Closing Purchase Price
Statement is referred to herein as the "Final Company Transaction Expenses;"
the final NWC as of the Closing, as set forth on the Final Post-Closing
Purchase Price Statement is referred to herein as the "Final NWC," and the
final Enterprise Value as of the Closing as set forth on the Final Post-
Closing Purchase Price Statement is referred to herein as the "Final
Enterprise Value." The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants
incurred in connection with the resolution of disputes pursuant to this
Section 2.5 shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in proportion to the amounts of
the disputed items on the Purchase Price Dispute Notice, as compared to such
items as determined by the Independent Accountants and set forth on the Final
Post-Closing Purchase Price Statement, with such fees and expenses to be paid
by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, (as applicable) to
the Independent Accountants within five (5) Business Days after
the Independent Accountants determination.

(b) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Purchase Price shall be:

(i) reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which the
Final Enterprise Value is less than the Estimated Enterprise Value, or
increased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which the
Final Enterprise Value is greater than the Estimated Enterprise Value;

 

(ii) reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which
the Final Closing Cash is less than the Estimated Closing Cash, or increased,
on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which the Final
Closing Cash is greater than the Estimated Closing Cash;

 

(iii) reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which
the Final Closing Indebtedness is greater than the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, or increased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount (if
any) by which the Final Closing Indebtedness is less than the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness; and

 

(iv) reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which
the Final Company Transaction Expenses are greater than the Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses, or increased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the
amount (if any) by which the Final Company Transaction Expenses are less than
the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses.

 



8 (c) _Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment_. Without duplication, all reductions
or increases set forth in Section 2.5(b) shall be aggregated and the Purchase
Price shall be reduced (a "Downward Post-Closing PP Adjustment") or increased
(an "Upward Post-Closing PP Adjustment" and, together with the Downward Post-
Closing PP Adjustment, the "Post-Closing PP Adjustment") accordingly. Any
Downward Post-Closing PP Adjustment shall be satisfied, within five (5)
Business Days after determination of the Final Post-Closing Purchase Price
Statement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Buyer. Any Upward Post-Closing PP Adjustment shall be satisfied,
within five (5) Business Days after determination of the Final Post-Closing
Purchase Price Statement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds by
Buyer to an account designated by Seller. The amount of any Post-Closing
Adjustment shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to the
date of payment at a rate equal to six percent (6%) per annum. Such interest
shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number
of days elapsed.

 

(d) _Post-Closing NWC Adjustment_. The Target NWC will be determined after the
close of the Twelve Month Measurement Period in accordance with methodology
set forth in Exhibit K hereto. After each month of the Twelve Month
Measurement Period, Buyer will provide Seller with an unaudited consolidated
balance sheet for Company and Sub for such month. Further, after the third,
sixth, ninth, and twelfth months of the Twelve Month Measurement Period, Buyer
will provide Seller with (i) Buyers calculation of the NWC for each month of
such three month period (calculated using the same methodology reflected in
the Example NWC Statement), and (ii) Buyers calculation of each such months
NWC Percentage, such that Seller can track the progress towards the final
determination of the Target NWC (collectively, the "Quarterly NWC Report");
provided that the fourth and final Quarterly NWC Report shall further include
the Buyers calculation of the Target NWC using the first three (3) Final
Quarterly NWC Reports. If Seller agrees with a Quarterly NWC Report, it shall
provide written notice thereof to Buyer within thirty (30) days after its
receipt of the same. If Seller disagrees with a Quarterly NWC Report, Seller
may, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of such Quarterly NWC Report,
provide written notice thereof to Buyer (the "NWC Dispute Notice"), which
shall provide reasonable detail concerning each item that Seller disputes in
such Quarterly NWC Report and include reasonable support for each
such position. If within the 30-day period following delivery of a Quarterly
NWC Report, Seller provides Buyer with written notice that Seller agrees with
such Quarterly NWC Report, or if within such 30-day period Seller fails to
deliver a NWC Dispute Notice, then in either of such circumstances, such
Quarterly NWC Report shall then be conclusively deemed a "Final Quarterly NWC
Report," and shall then be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller for all
purposes, including its use in the calculation of the Target NWC. For a
period of thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer of the NWC Dispute Notice,
Buyer and Seller shall use good faith commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve the disputed items set forth on the NWC Dispute Notice between
themselves and, if they are able to resolve all of such disputed items during
such time period, such Quarterly NWC Report shall be revised to the extent
necessary to reflect such resolution, and as so revised shall be conclusively
deemed a "Final Quarterly NWC Report," and shall be final and binding upon
Buyer and Seller for all purposes, including its use in the calculation of the
Target NWC. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all of the disputed
accounting items set forth on the NWC Dispute Notice within such thirty (30)
day period or such other period as they shall mutually agree upon, they shall
jointly engage the Independent Accountants and submit the disputed
accounting items to the Independent Accountants for resolution. The (i) the
specific details, processes and procedures of the dispute resolution process
and (ii) the specific team of accountants that shall review the disputed items
and participate in the writing of the written report referenced herein shall
be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller and set forth in the Independent
Accountants engagement letter. The Independent Accountants shall act as
experts and not arbiters and shall determine only those

 



9  accounting items on the Quarterly NWC Report being disputed by Buyer and
Seller as of the time of engagement of the Independent Accountants. The
Independent Accountants shall only decide the specific items under dispute
and their decision for each disputed amount must be within the range of values
assigned to each item in the Quarterly NWC Report and the NWC Dispute Notice.
Promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days after engagement of the
Independent Accountants, the Independent Accountants shall deliver a written
report to Buyer and Seller as to their resolution of the disputed items, which
shall include the resulting Quarterly NWC Report incorporating
such resolutions. The Quarterly NWC Report, as determined by the Independent
Accountants, shall be conclusively deemed the "Final Quarterly NWC Report" and
shall, absent manifest error, be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller for
all purposes. Promptly after the forth Final Quarterly NWC Report is
determined, Buyer shall use the Final Quarterly NWC Reports to calculate the
Target NWC in accordance with Exhibit K. If the Final NWC is less than the
Target NWC, then the amount of such shortfall (together with interest thereof
from and including the Closing Date to the date of payment at a rate equal to
six percent (6%) per annum) will reduce the Deferred Consideration Payment for
the First Deferred Consideration Period on a dollar-for-dollar basis. If the
Final NWC is greater than the Target NWC, then such excess (together with
interest thereof from and including the Closing Date to the date of payment at
a rate equal to six percent (6%) per annum) shall be added to the Deferred
Consideration Payment for the First Deferred Consideration Period on a dollar-
for-dollar basis (any such reduction or increase in the Purchase Price, the
"NWC Adjustment"). If there is an unresolved dispute with respect to the NWC
Adjustment at the time the First Deferred Consideration Payment is due, and
Buyer believes the resolution will result in the Final NWC being less than the
Target NWC, then Buyer may offset against the Deferred Consideration Payment
in accordance with Section 2.3(d) an amount Buyer reasonably believes is
necessary to cover the NWC Adjustment (plus interest) or so much thereof as in
dispute (which shall be deemed a Loss for purposes of Section 2.3(d)).

(e) _Adjustments for Tax Purposes_. Any payments made pursuant to Section 2.5
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

liability" as that term is defined in Part I, Subtitle, E, Title IV of ERISA,
and if any Employer were to withdraw from a "multi-employer plan" at or after
the Closing, none of the Employers would have any such "withdrawal liability;"
(iv) no Action has been initiated by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
to terminate any such plan or to appoint a trustee for any such plan; (v) no
Benefit Plan that is subject to Part III of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA has
failed to satisfy the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, whether or not waived; and (vi) no "reportable
event," as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any
Benefit Plan.

 

(f) To the Knowledge of Seller, except as required by applicable Law, no
provision of any Benefit Plan could reasonably be expected to result in any
limitation on Buyer or any of its Affiliates from amending or terminating any
Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date, and no such termination would result in
any Liability to Buyer for any additional contributions, penalties, premiums,
fees, fines, excise taxes, or any other charges or liabilities. The Employers
have no commitment or obligation and have not made any representations to any
employee, member, manager, consultant or independent contractor, whether or
not legally binding, to adopt, amend or modify any Benefit Plan in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise.

 

(g) Except as detailed on Section 3.20(g) of the Disclosure Schedules, to the

period of time beyond the end of the current plan year (except pursuant to
Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code or
applicable state medical benefits continuation law ("COBRA")) and the
Employers may terminate any such benefits upon thirty (30) days notice or
less without any Liability therefore. Each Benefit Plan subject to
the requirements of COBRA has been operated in compliance therewith. None of
the Employers has contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as defined
in Section 5000(c) of the Code). No person or entity other than the Employers
is, or has in the last five (5) years been, considered to be within a

the Employers within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of
ERISA.

 

(h) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened Action
relating to a Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), nor is
there any basis for such an Action. No Benefit Plan nor any fiduciary thereof
has been the direct or indirect subject of an order or investigation,
examination or audit by a Governmental Authority or quasi-governmental
agency, and there are no matters pending before any Governmental Authority,
including the IRS and the DOL with respect to any Benefit Plan. No Benefit
Plan has within the three years prior to the date hereof been the subject of

compliance, self-correction or similar program sponsored by any Governmental
Authority.

 

(i) There has been no amendment to, announcement by Seller, Company, Sub, or
any of their Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Benefit Plan that would increase the annual expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred for the most
recently completed fiscal year with respect to any stockholder,
director, employee, consultant or independent contractor, as applicable. None
of Seller, Company, Sub, or any of their Affiliates has any commitment or
obligation or has made any representations to any stockholder, officer,
employee, consultant or independent contractor, whether or not legally
binding, to adopt, amend or modify any Benefit Plan or any collective
bargaining agreement.

 

(j) To the Knowledge of Seller, each Benefit Plan that is subject to Section
409A of the Code has been operated in compliance with such section and all
applicable regulatory guidance (including notices, rulings and proposed and
final regulations). No tax Liability has arisen and is currently unpaid in
relation to a violation of Section 409A of the Code, nor is any tax Liability
expected to arise in connection with any payment as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(k) Each individual who is classified by Company or Sub as an independent
contractor has been properly classified for purposes of participation and
benefit accrual under each Benefit Plan.

(l) Except as detailed on Section 3.20(l) of the Disclosure Schedules,
neither the execution of this Agreement nor any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of
any additional or subsequent events): (i) entitle any current or
former member, manager, equity holder, officer, employee, contractor or
consultant of Company or Sub to severance pay or any other payment; (ii)
accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting of any stock options or
other payments, or increase the amount of any compensation due to any such
individual; (iii) limit or restrict the right of Company or Sub to merge,
amend or terminate any Benefit Plan; or (iv) increase the amount payable under
or result in any other material obligation pursuant to any Benefit Plan.

 



26 (m) To the Knowledge of Seller, for all Benefit Plans that are welfare plans
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), the Employers or their insurance
companies have established reserves at least sufficient to pay all claims
incurred under the provisions of such plans on, prior to and after the Closing
Date. The Employers have not received notice of any retrospective premium
charge for claims relating to any period prior to the Closing Date under such
contracts.

 

(n) No employer securities, employer real property or other employer property
is included in the assets of any Benefit Plan. 

(o) To the Knowledge of Seller, to the extent applicable, the Employers
currently conduct and have conducted all Benefit Plans in compliance with the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and all
regulations and formal guidance promulgated thereunder, including regulations
addressing privacy, security, maintenance, disclosure, confidentiality and
transmission of certain health-related information that are promulgated at 45
CFR Parts 160, 162, and 164.

(p) To the Knowledge of Seller, neither the Employers nor any Benefit Plan
has engaged in any transaction that is considered by the IRS to be a "Listed
Transaction." No Benefit Plan is a plan covered by Section 412(i) of the Code
(prior to its amendment effective January 1, 2008) or Section 412(e)(3) of
the Code as amended effective January 1, 2008.

 

(q) Company does not have outstanding, and has never issued, any option
grants.

authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of Innospec. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Innospec, and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer and Seller) this Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Innospec enforceable
against Innospec in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions. When each of the other Transaction Documents to which Innospec is
or will be a party has been duly executed and delivered by Innospec (assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party thereto), such
Transaction Document will constitute a legal and binding obligation of
Innospec enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

The execution, delivery and performance by Innospec of this Agreement and the

conflict with or result in a violation or breach of, or default under,
any provision of the Organizational Documents of Innospec; (b) conflict with

assets or business of Innospec; or (d) result in the creation or imposition of
any Encumbrance other than Permitted Encumbrances on any properties or assets
of Innospec, except in the case of Section 5.2(c) above, for such defaults or
other events which, either individually or in the aggregate, would not (x)
have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or (y) materially impair the ability of
Innospec to perform its obligations under this Agreement and each Transaction
Document to which each is, or is specified to be, a party. No consent,
approval, Permit, Governmental Order, declaration or filing with, or notice
to, any Governmental Authority is required by Innospec in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
except for (i) such filings as may be required under the HSR Act, (ii) those

the ability of Innospec to perform its obligations under this Agreement and
each Transaction Document to which each is, or is specified to be, a party and
(iii) those that may be required solely by reason of Sellers (as opposed to
any other third partys) participation in the transactions contemplated
hereby.

---|--- 

(a) Since December 31, 2011, Innospec has filed with or furnished to the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents required to be so filed or furnished (the
"Innospec SEC Documents"). All of the Innospec SEC Documents (other than
preliminary material), as of their respective filing dates, complied as to
form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and, in each case, the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to such the Innospec
SEC Documents. None of the Innospec SEC Documents at the time of filing
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material

 



35  fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been modified or
superseded by later Innospec SEC Documents. As of their respective dates, the
consolidated financial statements of Innospec included in the Innospec SEC
Documents complied as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects
in accordance with the applicable requirements of GAAP, the financial position
of Innospec as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to notes and to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments).

 

(b) To the Knowledge of Innospec, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Innospec SEC Documents.

control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) that comply in all material respects with the requirements of
the Exchange Act.



   Section 5.4 | Sufficiency of Innospec Stock. 
---|--- 

Innospec has, and will have, sufficient Innospec Stock to satisfy its
obligations hereunder. At such time as each of the conditions and holding
periods under Rule 144 (as promulgated under the Securities Act and in effect
as of the applicable time) with respect to the transferability of the
Stock Consideration by a Non-Management Member have been satisfied, at
Sellers request and subject to Innospecs receipt of customary representation
letter(s) and opinion(s) of counsel, Innospec will direct its stock transfer
agent to remove the Rule 144 restrictive legend from the Stock Consideration
issued to the applicable Non-Management Member(s), such that such Stock
Consideration will transferable without registration under the Securities Act,
subject to compliance by such Non-Management Members with any other
applicable securities laws or other applicable laws.



   Section 5.5 | Brokers. 
---|--- 

Except as set forth in Section 5.5 of the Disclosure Schedules, no broker,
finder or investment banker engaged by or acting on behalf of Innospec is
entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Innospec.

existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore

promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after receipt
thereof by Seller or its Representatives) advise Buyer orally and in writing
of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the
same.

(c) Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
Section 6.3 shall include having such provision specifically enforced by any
court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any
such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer and
that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer.



   Section 6.4 | Notice of Certain Events. 
---|--- 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, Seller shall promptly notify
Buyer in writing of:

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence
or taking of which (A) has had, or could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (B)
has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the failure of
any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 to be satisfied;

(ii) any notice or, to the Knowledge of the Company, other communication from

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iv) any Actions commenced or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened in
writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Seller,
Company, or Sub that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.17.

 



38 (b) Buyers receipt of information pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall not

Disclosure Schedules.

(c) From the date hereof until the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or
taking of which (A) has had, or could reasonably be expected to have,

---|--- 

Seller shall deliver to Buyer written resignations, effective as of
the Closing Date, of the officers and managers of Company and Sub requested

   Section 6.6 | Confidentiality. 
---|--- 

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, hold, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its or their
respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information,
whether written or oral, concerning Company or Sub, except to the extent that
Seller can show that such information (a) is generally available to the public
through no breach by Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives of its confidentiality obligations or (b) is
lawfully acquired by Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives from and after the Closing from sources which are not
prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation. If Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of Law, Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such
information which Seller is advised by its counsel in writing is legally
required to be disclosed. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.6 to the
contrary, Seller and its Affiliates shall be permitted to disclose the
existence and terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby to Persons (i) who are

 



39  current investors or financing sources of Seller or its Affiliates, or (ii)
to whom such disclosure is reasonably necessary to do business with Seller and
its Affiliates and who shall agree to keep such information confidential;
provided that no such disclosures are reasonably deemed by Innospec to create
the need to file or amend an 8-K or to otherwise make a public announcement.

 

(b) Until the Closing, the information provided will be subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 10, 2013, between
Company and Innospec (as it may be amended from time to time, the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the parties hereto shall not, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and Representatives not to, use such information for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. If, for
any reason, the Closing does not occur, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.



   Section 6.7 | Non-competition; Non-solicitation. 
---|--- 

(a) For a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or assist others in
engaging in the Restricted Business in the Territory; or (ii) have an
interest in any Person that engages directly or indirectly in the Restricted
Business in the Territory in any capacity, including as a partner,
shareholder, equity holder, member, manager, employee, principal, agent,
trustee or consultant; or (iii) intentionally interfere in any material
respect with the business relationships (whether formed prior to or after the
date of this Agreement) between Company or Sub, on the one hand,
and customers or suppliers of Company or Sub, on the other hand, with respect
to the Restricted Business in the Territory. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) Seller may own, directly or indirectly, solely as a financial investor,
securities of any Person that would otherwise be prohibited by the preceding
sentence, provided Seller neither, directly or indirectly, owns 10% or more of
any class of securities of such Person, nor is a controlling Person of, or a
member of a group which controls, such Person; and (ii) any non-employee
board members of Seller, other than CSL Capital Management, LLC or its
controlled Affiliates, may hold positions on boards of other companies that
engage in the Restricted Business; and (iii) Seller and its controlled
Affiliates shall be able to continue to invest in companies that are not
primarily in the Restricted Business as of the date of such investment nor
have the intention as of such date to enter into business competitive
with Company; provided, however, that during the Restricted Period Seller and
its Affiliates will not direct or encourage such companies to enter into the
Restricted Business in the Territory.

 

(b) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any
of its controlled Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any
employee of Company or Sub, or encourage any such employee to leave such
employment or hire any such employee who has left such employment, except
pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any
such employees; provided, that nothing in this Section 6.7(b) shall prevent
Seller or any of its Affiliates from hiring (i) any employee whose employment
has been terminated by Company, Sub, or Buyer, or (ii) after one year from
the date of termination of employment, any employee whose employment has been
terminated by the employee.

(c) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, solicit or entice, or attempt to
solicit or entice, any clients or customers of Company or Sub, or potential
clients or customers of Company or Sub, for purposes of diverting their
business or services from Company or Sub.

 



40 (d) Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this Section
6.7 would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of a
breach or a threatened breach by Seller of any such obligations, Buyer
shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be
available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief,
including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance
and any other relief that may be available from a court of competent
jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

(e) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 6.7
are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and
constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this Section 6.7 should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly
empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed,
in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service, or
other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in
this Section 6.7 and each provision hereof are severable and distinct
covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such
covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable
the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

 



   Section 6.8 | Governmental Approvals and Consents. 
---|--- 

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, (i) make, or cause to
be made, all filings and submissions (including those under the HSR Act)
required under any Law applicable to such party or any of its Affiliates; and
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained,
all consents, authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental
Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Each party shall cooperate
fully with the other party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain
all such consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. The parties hereto
shall not willfully take any action that will have the effect of delaying,
impairing or impeding the receipt of any required consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals.

 

(b) Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all
notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are
described in Section 3.5 of the Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of Innospec, Buyer, Seller,
Company or Sub shall be required to compensate any third party, commence or
participate in any legal or administrative proceeding, claim, suit or action
or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third
party to obtain any such consent.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the parties undertakings pursuant to
subsections (a) and (b) above, each of the parties hereto shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to:

(i) respond to any inquiries by any Governmental Authority regarding
antitrust or other matters with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;

 



41 (ii) avoid the imposition of any order or the taking of any action that
would restrain, alter or enjoin the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

(iii) in the event any Governmental Order adversely affecting the ability of
the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has
been enacted, promulgated, enforced or entered, to have such Governmental
Order vacated or lifted.

 

(d) If any consent, approval or authorization necessary to preserve any right
or benefit under any Contract to which Company or Sub is a party is not
obtained prior to the Closing, Seller shall, subsequent to the Closing,
cooperate with Buyer, Company, and Sub in attempting to obtain such consent,
approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable. If
such consent, approval or authorization cannot be obtained, Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide Company and Sub with the rights
and benefits of the affected Contract for the term thereof, and, if Seller
provides such rights and benefits, Company or Sub shall assume all
obligations and burdens thereunder.

(e) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between Seller, Company, or Sub with Governmental Authorities in the ordinary
course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law or any
disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the
other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it
being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each party shall give notice to the
other party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact
with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other party with
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion,
appearance or contact.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.8 shall require,
or be construed to require, Seller, Company, Sub, Buyer or any of their
Affiliates to agree to (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or
after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or interests of Buyer,
Seller, Company, Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) any
conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any
such assets, businesses or interests which, in either case, could reasonably
be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Buyer Material
Adverse Effect or materially and adversely impact the economic or business
benefits to Buyer or Seller of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or (iii) any material modification or waiver of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

 



42 ---|--- 

(a) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by Seller prior to the Closing, or for any other reasonable purpose,
for a period of 4 years after the Closing, Buyer shall:

 

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of Company and
Sub relating to periods prior to the Closing in a consistent in all material
respects with the prior practices of Company and Sub; and

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Seller reasonable
access (including the right to make, at Sellers expense, photocopies), during
normal business hours, to such books and records;

 

provided, however, that any books and records related to Tax matters shall be
retained pursuant to the periods set forth in Article VII.

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by, or against,
or incurred by Buyer, Company, or Sub after the Closing, or for any other
reasonable purpose, for a period of 4 years following the Closing, Seller
shall:

 

(i) retain the books and records of Seller which relate to Company and Sub and
their operations for periods prior to the Closing; and

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Buyer, Company, or
Sub reasonable access (including the right to make, at Buyers expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books and records;

provided, however, that any books and records related to Tax matters shall be
retained pursuant to the periods set forth in Article VII.

 

(c) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to provide the other party
with access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to
this Section 6.9 where such access would violate any Law.



   Section 6.10 | Closing Conditions. 
---|--- 

From the date hereof until the Closing, each party hereto shall, and Seller
shall cause Company and Sub to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take
such actions as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions
set forth in Article VIII hereof. Prior to or concurrently with the
Closing, all contracts, arrangements or Liabilities between Company or Sub,
on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than Company and
Sub), on the other hand, shall be terminated without any ongoing Liability of
any party thereto, and Seller shall take such action as may be necessary so
that, effective as of the Closing, there shall be no Liabilities owed to or
from Company or Sub, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than Company and Sub), on the other hand.



   Section 6.11 | Public Announcements. 
---|--- 

Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or stock exchange requirements
(based upon the reasonable advice of counsel), no party to this Agreement
shall make any public announcements in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any news media
without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the parties shall cooperate as to
the timing and contents of any such announcement.

 



43 ---|--- 

Following the Closing, each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such additional documents,
instruments, conveyances and assurances and take such further actions as may
be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain executed estoppel certificates prior to the Closing
from each of Companys and Subs landlords, in substantially the form
of Exhibit H hereto and, to the extent applicable, non-disturbance agreements
from ground lessors or lenders to any of the landlords of Company and Sub that
have an interest superior to the leasehold interest of Company and Sub.

 



   Section 6.13 | Deferred Consideration Payment Covenants. 
---|--- 

(a) On or before the Closing Date, Seller will establish an operations
committee consisting of two (2) members of Sellers board of managers (the
"Operations Committee"), and such Operations Committee shall initially consist
Charles S. Leykum and Vivek Raj. After the expiration of the Second Deferred
Consideration Period, Sellers obligation to maintain the Operations Committee
shall expire.

 

(b) From the Closing Date until the expiration of the Second Deferred
Consideration Period, in order to facilitate the measurement of the Adjusted
EBITDA, Buyer shall cause Company and Sub (i) to be operated collectively on a
stand-alone basis and as a separate independent business unit distinct from
Buyer and its other existing businesses; and (ii) maintain separate financial
books and records for Company and Sub (although the books and records of
Company and Sub may be consolidated with each other).

 

(c) From the Closing Date until the expiration of the Second Deferred
Consideration Period, Buyer and Company agree that Company will not undertake
any of the following actions without disclosing to Sellers Operations
Committee in writing its intent to take such action and such information as
Seller may reasonably request with respect to such action: (i) selling,
liquidating or winding-down the revenue-generating businesses of Company or
Sub whether by merger, stock sale, asset sale or otherwise; (ii) providing
discounts to customers, except as may be consistent with past practice
or reasonably believed to be necessary to retain the customer, or pursuant to
arrangements in place prior to Closing; (iii) implementing purchasing or
supplying programs, transfer pricing, or other arrangements, other than as is
consistent with past practice at Company that may disadvantage the business
of Company and Sub versus Buyers other businesses or Affiliates; or (iv)
operate the business of Company and Sub other than in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice. The parties hereto agree that the
Operations Committee shall have ten (10) Business Days after its receipt of
notice and the requested information to provide Buyer with written notice of
its conclusions on the impact of any of actions described in clauses (c)(i)
and (c)(iii) and five (5) Business Days after its receipt of notice and the
requested information to provide Buyer with written notice of its conclusions
on the impact of any of the actions described in clauses (c)(ii) and (c)(iv)
on the future Deferred Consideration Payments. If the Operation Committee does
not respond with such notice within the applicable period, Seller shall be
deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the actions described in
Companys or Buyers notice require no adjustment to the Deferred
Consideration Payments. If, however, the Operation Committee does respond with
written conclusions within such applicable Business Day period, then the
parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the impact
of such actions on the future Deferred Consideration Payments and any
appropriate adjustments to each Deferred Consideration Payment (or the
calculation thereof) as a result thereof; provided, however, that the parties
agree that no adjustments will be made unless the impact of such action on
Adjusted EBITDA, individually or in the aggregate with other actions described
herein, is reasonably expected to equal or exceed $50,000. 

 



44 (d) From the Closing Date until the expiration of the First
Deferred Consideration Period, Buyer and Company agree that Company will not
undertake any of the following actions without disclosing to Sellers
Operations Committee in writing its intent to take such action and such
information as Seller may reasonably request with respect to such action: (i)
sell, transfer or encumber any assets of Company, valued at greater than
$250,000 or that is otherwise outside the ordinary course of business; (ii)
fire, unless for cause, hire, or renew the contract of any senior management
member of Company or enter into any employment contract with a base salary in

transaction. The parties hereto agree that the Operations Committee shall have
ten (10) Business Days after its receipt of notice and the requested
information to provide Buyer with written notice of its conclusions on the
impact of any of such actions on the future Deferred Consideration Payments.
If the Operation Committee does not respond with such notice within such ten
(10) Business Day period, Seller shall be deemed to have acknowledged and
agreed that the actions described in Companys or Buyers notice require no
adjustment to the Deferred Consideration Payments. If, however, the Operation
Committee does respond with written conclusions within such ten (10) Business
Day period, then the parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
agree on the impact of such actions on the future Deferred Consideration
Payments and any appropriate adjustments to each Deferred Consideration
Payment (or the calculation thereof) as a result thereof; provided, however,
that the parties agree that no adjustments will be made unless the impact of
such action on Adjusted EBITDA, individually or in the aggregate with
other actions described herein, is reasonably expected to equal or exceed
$50,000.

(e) After the expiration of the First Deferred Consideration Period, and
until the expiration of the Second Deferred Consideration Period, Buyer and
Company agree that Company will not undertake any of the following actions
without disclosing to Sellers Operations Committee in writing its intent to
take such action and such information as Seller may reasonably request with
respect to such action: (i) sell, transfer or encumber any assets of Company,
valued at greater than $1,000,000 or that is otherwise outside the ordinary
course of business; (ii) change the principal business of Company, enter into

Company for a purchase price in excess of $5,000,000 or that is otherwise
outside the ordinary course of business of Company; or (v) approve Companys
initial budget, and all subsequent annual budgets, and all material deviations
therefrom. The parties hereto agree that the Operations Committee shall have
ten (10) Business Days after its receipt of notice and the requested
information to provide Buyer with its conclusions on the impact of any of such
actions on the future Deferred Consideration Payment. If the Operation
Committee does not respond with such notice within such ten (10) Business Day
period, Seller shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the
actions described in Companys or Buyers notice require no adjustment to the
future Deferred Consideration Payment. If, however, the Operation Committee
does respond with written conclusions within such ten (10) Business Day
period, then the parties agree to use commercially

 



45  reasonable efforts to agree on the impact of such actions on the future
Deferred Consideration Payment and any appropriate adjustments to such
Deferred Consideration Payment (or the calculation thereof) as a result
thereof; provided, however, that the parties agree that no adjustments will be
made unless the impact of such action on Adjusted EBITDA, individually or in
the aggregate with other actions as described herein, is reasonably expected
to equal or exceed $50,000.

(f) In the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreement with
respect to the impact of such action on the Deferred Consideration Payment(s)
and the appropriate adjustments to such payment(s) or calculation thereof
within thirty (30) Business Days following Buyers written notice to Seller
delivered pursuant to Section 6.13(c), Section 6.13(d) or Section 6.13(e),
either party may give written notice to the other party and to the Independent
Accountants, who will be asked to confirm or disagree with the positions taken
by the parties. The Independent Accountants may request information from
Company, Buyer or Seller or the Operations Committee. Each party will provide
to the Independent Accountants all information reasonably requested to enable
the Independent Accountants to determine the impact of such action on the
Deferred Consideration Payment(s) and the appropriate adjustment as a result
thereof (which shall be no adjustment if the impact of such action on Adjusted
EBITDA is reasonably expected to be less than $100,000). The final
determination of the Independent Accountants with respect to such matter shall
be final and binding on all parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants incurred in connection with the resolution of disputes pursuant
to this Section 6.13(f) shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty
percent (50%) by Seller, or such other proportion as the Independent
Accountants deem appropriate based upon its determination as to who and to
what extent each party prevailed, with such fees and expenses to be paid by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand (as applicable), to the
Independent Accountants within five (5) Business Days after the
Independent Accountants determination.

(g) Subject to the terms of this Section 6.13, after the Closing, Buyer
shall have sole discretion with regard to all matters relating to the
operation of Company and Sub and shall have no obligation to operate Company
or Sub in order to achieve any Deferred Consideration Payment or to maximize
the amount of any Deferred Consideration Payment; provided, that Buyer shall
not, directly or indirectly, take any actions (i) to intentionally avoid,
circumvent or reduce any of the Deferred Consideration Payments hereunder, or
(ii) to divert away from Company, whether or not to any other Affiliates of
Buyer, any customers or prospective customers of Company for any business for
goods or services offered by Company.

 

(h) Buyer agrees to cause Company to deliver to Seller monthly consolidated
financial statements of Company and Sub by the fifteenth (15th) business day
of each succeeding month for all calendar months through the conclusion of the
Second Deferred Consideration Period.

expense item that is included in the determination of Adjusted EBITDA,
reported by Company at any time during the First or Second Deferred
Consideration Period, it shall provide Buyer written notice of the question or
concern, and Buyer will, within fifteen (15) Business Days, explain, in
writing, its actions with respect to the questioned items and such
information as Seller may reasonably request with respect to the same. Should
Seller disagree with the calculations of any item affecting the Adjusted
EBITDA, it will give written notice to Company, Buyer and the Independent
Accountants, who will be asked to confirm or disagree with the positions taken
by Company. The Independent Accountants may request information from Company,
Buyer or Seller. Each party will provide to the Independent Accountants all
information reasonably

 



46  requested, whether of Company, Buyer or any Affiliates, to enable the
Independent Accountants to determine Companys Adjusted EBITDA for a Deferred
Consideration Period. The final determination of the Independent Accountants
of Companys Adjusted EBITDA for a Deferred Consideration Period shall be
final and binding on all parties.



   Section 6.14 | Disclosure Schedule; Notices of Breaches. 
---|--- 

From time to time prior to the Closing, Seller may supplement or amend the
Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or
discovered which, if known, existing or occurring at the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in
such sections of the Disclosure Schedules. No such supplement or amendment
shall be evidence, in and of itself, that the representations and warranties
in the corresponding Section are no longer true and correct in all material
respects or that such items are material. It is specifically agreed that such
proposed supplement or amendment may seek to add immaterial, as well as
material, items to the Disclosure Schedule. Any disclosure in any such
supplement or amendment shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
including for purposes of indemnification or termination rights contained in
this Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 have been satisfied.



   Section 6.15 | Contact with Customers and Suppliers. 
---|--- 

Buyer hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and shall not
permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates to) contact
any employee, supplier, distributor, customer or other material business
relation of Company or Sub prior to the Closing without the prior written
consent of Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed.

ARTICLE VII

 

TAX MATTERS



   Section 7.1 | Tax Covenants. 
---|--- 

(a) Seller and Buyer agree to treat the purchase and sale of the Membership
Interests pursuant to this Agreement, as the purchase and sale of the assets
of Company and Sub for federal income tax purposes. The parties agree to
report, and cause their respective Affiliates to report, such transaction
in the manner described for all Tax purposes, and not to take, or cause or
allow their respective Affiliates to take, any position inconsistent therewith
in any proceeding or Tax Return.

 

(b) For purposes of Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable regulations
thereunder, the Purchase Price plus any liabilities of the Company shall be
allocated among the assets of Company and Sub in accordance with the
methodology set forth in Exhibit F hereto (the "Purchase Price Allocation").
The parties and their respective Affiliates shall (i) timely file all Tax
Returns required to be filed in connection with the Purchase Price Allocation
(including IRS Form 8594 and any supplemental filings to reflect any revisions
to the Purchase Price Allocation) and (ii) prepare and file all Tax Returns
and determine all Taxes in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price
Allocation, except as may be otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or similar provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law). Each of the parties shall notify the other
party if it (or any of its Affiliates) receives notice that any taxing
authority proposes any allocation that differs from the Purchase
Price Allocation.

 



47 (c) None of Buyer, Company or Sub shall file or permit to be filed any
amended Tax Return with respect to Company or Sub for any (i) Pre-Closing Tax
Period or (ii) any Straddle Period with respect to which Seller would have any
liability without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
(including any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be
borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer. The
parties will cooperate to timely file any necessary Tax Returns with respect
thereto. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avail itself
of any available exemptions from any such Taxes and fees, and to cooperate
with the other party in providing any information and documentation that may
be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

 

(e) Seller at its cost shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns
of Company and/or Sub with respect to all Tax periods ending on or before the
Closing Date. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and without a change of
any election or any accounting method and shall be submitted by Seller to
Buyer (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by
Buyer, supporting documentation) at least forty-five (45) days prior to the
due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If Buyer objects to any
item on any such Tax Return, it shall, within twenty (20) days after delivery
of such Tax Return, notify Seller in writing that it so objects, specifying
with particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal
basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly
delivered, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and Seller are unable
to reach such agreement within ten days after receipt by Seller of such
notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Independent Accountant and
any determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final. The
Independent Accountant shall resolve any disputed items within thirty (30)
days of having the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may
require. If the Independent Accountant is unable to resolve any disputed items
before the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as
prepared by Seller and then amended to reflect the Independent Accountants
resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall
be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

 

(f) Buyer at its cost shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns
of Company and/or Sub other than Tax Returns described Section 7.1(e). Any
such Tax Return relating to a Straddle Period shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and without a
change of any election or any accounting method and shall be submitted by
Buyer to Seller (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent
requested by Seller, supporting documentation) at least forty-five (45) days
prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If Seller
objects to any item on any such Tax Return relating to a Straddle Period, it
shall, within twenty (20) days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Buyer
in writing that it so objects, specifying with particularity any such item
and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a
notice of objection shall be duly delivered, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate
in good faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such
items. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement within ten (10)
days after receipt by Buyer of such notice, the disputed items shall be
resolved by the Independent Accountant and any determination by the
Independent Accountant shall be final. The Independent Accountant shall
resolve any disputed items within thirty (30) days of having the item referred
to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the Independent
Accountant is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date for
such Tax Return, the

 



48  Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer and then amended to reflect
the Independent Accountants resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. The
preparation and filing of any Tax Return of Company or Sub that does not
relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be exclusively within the control of
Buyer.

 



   Section 7.2 | Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements. 
---|--- 

Any and all existing Tax sharing agreements (whether written or not) binding
upon Company or Sub shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such
date neither Seller, Company, Sub nor any of Sellers Affiliates and their
respective Representatives shall have any further rights or liabilities
thereunder.



   Section 7.3 | Tax Indemnification. 
---|--- 

(a) Except to the extent treated as a liability in the calculation of Final
NWC, Seller shall indemnify Company, Sub, Buyer, and each Buyer Indemnitee and
hold them harmless from and against (a) any Loss attributable to any breach of
or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made in Section 3.22; (b) any
Loss attributable to any breach or violation of, or failure to fully perform,
any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in Article VII; (c) all
Taxes of Company or Sub, or relating to the business of Company or Sub, for
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods; (d) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Company or Sub (or any
predecessor of Company or Sub) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing
Date by reason of a liability under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or
any comparable provisions of foreign, state or local Law; and (e) any and all
Taxes of any person imposed on Company or Sub arising under the principles of
transferee or successor liability or by contract or otherwise, relating to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing Date. Seller shall reimburse
Buyer for any Taxes of Company or Sub that are the responsibility of
Seller pursuant to this Section 7.3 within ten (10) Business Days after
payment of such Taxes by Buyer, Company, or Sub.

 

(b) For purposes of this Section 7.3, (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be determined without
regard to any materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or other similar
qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or
warranty, and (ii) in such case, each such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement shall be read as if all such qualifications were omitted
therefrom.

 

(c) Once a Loss is agreed to by Seller or finally adjudicated to be payable
pursuant to this Agreement, Seller shall satisfy its obligations within
thirty (30) days of such agreement or adjudication by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The parties hereto agree that should Seller not
make full payment of any such obligations within such thirty (30) day period,
any amount payable shall accrue interest from and including the first day
following the end of the thirty (30) day period to the date such payment has
been made at a rate per annum equal to six percent (6%). Such interest shall
be calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number of
days elapsed. Buyer may elect to offset against any Deferred Consideration
Payment otherwise due, any Loss agreed to by Seller or otherwise finally
determined to be payable.

 



49 ---|--- 

In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date (each such period, a "Straddle
Period"), the portion of any such Taxes that are treated as Pre-Closing Taxes
for purposes of this Agreement shall be:

 

(a) in the case of Taxes based upon, or related to, income or receipts, deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended with the
Closing Date; and

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire period.

 



   Section 7.5 | Contests. 
---|--- 

Buyer agrees to give written notice to Seller of the receipt of any
written notice to Company, Sub, Buyer, or any of Buyers Affiliates which
involves the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any Action, in
respect of which an indemnity may be sought by Buyer pursuant to this Article
VII (a "Tax Claim"); provided, that failure to comply with this provision
shall not affect Buyers right to indemnification hereunder, except and only
to the extent that Seller forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such
failure. Except with respect to Tax Claims relating exclusively to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, Buyer shall control the contest or resolution of any Tax
Claim; provided, however, that Buyer shall obtain the prior written consent of
Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before
entering into any settlement of a claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or ceasing to defend any such claim; and, provided further, that Seller shall
be entitled to participate in the defense of a claim relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose, the
fees and expenses of which separate counsel shall be borne solely by Seller.
With respect to any Tax Claim relating exclusively to one or more Pre-Closing
Tax Periods, Seller shall control the contest or resolution of such Tax Claim;
provided, however, that Seller shall obtain the prior written consent of Buyer
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend
such claim; and, provided further, that Buyer shall be entitled to participate
in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose, the fees and expenses of which separate counsel shall be borne
solely by Buyer.



   Section 7.6 | Cooperation and Exchange of Information. 
---|--- 

Seller and Buyer shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing
any Tax Return pursuant to this Article VII or in connection with any audit or
other proceeding in respect of Taxes of Company. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions
thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by tax authorities. Each
of Seller and Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers,
records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of
Company or Sub for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until
the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which
such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions
except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of such extensions
for the respective Tax periods. Prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other
documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of Company or Sub for any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer (as the
case may be) shall provide the other party with reasonable written notice and
offer the other party the opportunity to take custody of such materials.

 



50 ---|--- 

Any indemnification payments pursuant to this Article VII shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.



   Section 7.8 | Survival. 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions
of Section 3.22 and this Article VII shall survive for the full period of all
applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof) plus sixty (60) days.

 



   Section 7.9 | Tax Refunds. 
---|--- 

Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Seller within thirty (30) days after
receipt, any refunds of Taxes with respect to which Seller has agreed to
provide indemnification under this Agreement or refunds of Taxes that are
treated as a liability in the calculation of the Final NWC (including
any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes incurred in respect of the
receipt or accrual of the refund); provided, however, that Buyer shall be
entitled to any refunds of Taxes to the extent such refunds are treated as an
asset in the calculation of the Final NWC. Upon the request of Seller, Buyer
shall file (or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns (including amended Tax
Returns) or other documents claiming any refunds to which Seller is entitled
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. In the event that any such
Tax refund is subsequently disallowed in whole or part by any Governmental
Authority, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for the Losses with respect thereto.
Seller shall promptly reimburse Company for any expenses incurred in filing,
defending or prosecuting any Tax refund paid to Seller pursuant to this
Section 7.9.



   Section 7.10 | Overlap. 
---|--- 

To the extent that any obligation or responsibility pursuant to Article IX

the provisions of this Article VII shall govern.

assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") against, and shall hold each
of them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them
for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Buyer Indemnitees based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason
of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
of Seller contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by or on

breach thereof shall be pursuant to Article VII), as of the Closing Date

specified date, the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with
reference to such specified date); or

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of, or failure to perform, any
covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement (other than any breach or

inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with reference to such
specified date); or

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Buyer or Innospec pursuant to this Agreement (other than
Article VII, it being understood that the sole remedy for any such breach

    Section 9.4 | Certain Limitations. 
---|--- 

The indemnification provided for in Section 9.2 and Section 9.3 shall be
subject to the following limitations:

(a) Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 9.2(a) (other than with respect to a claim for indemnification
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty in Section 3.1, Section 3.2,
Section 3.3, Section 3.4, Section 3.19, Section 3.21(e), Section 3.23, Section
3.24 and Section 3.26 (the "Buyer Basket and Cap Exclusions"), until the
aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section
9.2(a) (other than those based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by
reason of the Buyer Basket and Cap Exclusions, for which Seller shall be
liable for all Losses, subject to the balance of the limitations set forth
herein) exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Basket"), in which event Seller shall be
required to pay or be liable for the Losses in excess of the Basket in
accordance with this Article IX. Moreover, if Buyer fails to obtain any of the
estoppel certificates referenced in Section 6.12, Buyer Basket and Cap
Exclusions shall also include Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed
upon, the Buyer Indemnitees based upon, arising out of, with respect to, or by
reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in
Section 3.9 or Section 3.10 that would have been cured or waived by the
applicable landlords execution of such estoppel certificate.

(b) Neither Buyer nor Innospec shall be liable to the Seller Indemnitees for
indemnification under Section 9.3(a) (other than with respect to a claim for
indemnification based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in Section 4.1,
Section 4.4, Section 5.1 and Section 5.5 (the "Seller Basket and Cap
Exclusions"), until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification under Section 9.3(a) (other than those based upon, arising out
of, with respect to

 



56  or by reason of the Seller Basket and Cap Exclusions, for which Buyer and
Innospec shall be jointly and severally liable for all Losses, subject to the
balance of the limitations set forth herein) exceeds the Basket, in which
event Buyer and Innospec, jointly and severally, shall be required to pay or
be liable for the Losses in excess of the Basket in accordance with this
Article IX.

 

(c) Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 9.2(a) for any Losses in excess of an amount equal to the Cap
Amount; _provided_ , _that_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cap Amount
shall not apply to, or take account of, any Losses based upon, arising out of,
with respect to or by reason of the Buyer Basket and Cap Exclusions, breaches
of Article VI, or any fraud. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, in no
event shall the aggregate indemnification to be paid by Seller under this
Article IX exceed the Purchase Price.

 

(d) Neither Buyer nor Innospec shall be liable to the Seller Indemnitees for
indemnification under Section 9.3(a) for any Losses in excess of an amount
equal to the Cap Amount; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Cap Amount shall not apply to, or take account of, any Losses based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of the Seller Basket and Cap
Exclusions, breaches of Article VI, or any fraud.

(e) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article IX shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified
party under insurance policies or otherwise from a third party with respect to
such Losses (net of any Tax or expenses incurred in connection with such
recovery, and net of any increased insurance premiums to be incurred as a
consequence of such recovery). Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to recover under insurance policies for any Losses prior to seeking
indemnification under this Agreement.

(f) Seller shall have no liability to indemnify with respect to any Losses in
respect of any matter that is taken into account in the calculation of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article II.

 

(g) For purposes of this Article IX, (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement shall be determined without
regard to any knowledge (including the defined terms "Seller Knowledge" and
"Knowledge of Seller"), materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect, Buyer
Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained in or
otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty, and (ii) in such
case, each such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be read
as if all such qualifications were omitted therefrom. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the "Seller Knowledge" or
"Knowledge of Seller" qualifiers in Section 3.9, the last sentence of Section
3.10(b), the last sentence of Section 3.12(e), Section 3.15, Section 3.17(a),
Section 3.18, Section 3.20(h), Section 3.21(b), the second to last sentence of
Section 3.21(c), and Section 3.23.



   Section 9.5 | Indemnification Procedures. 
---|--- 

The party making a claim under this Article IX is referred to as the
"Indemnified Party", and the party against whom such claims are asserted under
this Article IX is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party".

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this

 



57  Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative
of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with
respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later
than ten (10) calendar days after receipt of such notice of such Third Party
Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by as
a result of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe
the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all
material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount,
if reasonably practicable, of the Losses that has been or may be sustained by
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys
expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel who is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
in good faith in such defense (at the Indemnified Partys cost and expense);
provided, that (i) if the Indemnifying Party is Seller, such Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of any such
Third Party Claim that is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that
is a supplier or customer of Company, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party
Claim that seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party (each, a "Special Claim"). The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to participate in the defense of any Special Claim at the
Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel who
is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. The Indemnified Party shall not
settle any Special Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall be permitted to withhold
its consent to any proposed settlement that does not provide for an
unqualified release of the Indemnifying Party of any liability thereunder. In
the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, subject to Section 9.5(b), it shall have the right to take such action
as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims
pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject
to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the defense thereof. The fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party, provided, that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to
the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one
(1) counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party determines counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly
notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided
in this Agreement, or fails to reasonably diligently prosecute the defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 9.5(b),
pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for
any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party
Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including
making available (subject to the provisions of Section 6.6) records relating
to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 



58 (b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, except as provided in this Section 9.5(b). If a firm offer
is made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the
admission of liability, or the creation of a financial or other obligation on
the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying
Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall
give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten days after
its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to contest or
defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the
Indemnifying Party for Losses as to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed
the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent
to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set
forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified
Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 9.5(a), it shall not agree
to any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than ten (10) days
after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The failure to
give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such
notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall
allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether
and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and
the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to Companys
premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond
within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms
and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

(d) _Cooperation_. Upon a reasonable request by the Indemnifying Party, each
Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder in respect of any Direct
Claim, hereby agrees to consult with the Indemnifying Party and act reasonably
to take actions reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in order to
attempt to reduce the amount of Losses in respect of such Direct Claim. Any
costs or expenses associated with taking such actions shall be included as
Losses hereunder.

 

(e) _Tax Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
control of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding in respect of Taxes of
Company (including, but not limited to, any such claim in respect of a breach
of the representations and warranties in Section 3.22 hereof or any breach or
violation of or failure to fully perform any covenant, agreement, undertaking
or obligation in Article VII) shall be governed exclusively by Article VII
hereof.

 



59 ---|--- 

Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated
to be payable pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall
satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) days of such agreement or
adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The parties
hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make full payment of any
such obligations within such fifteen (15) day period, any amount payable shall
accrue interest from and including the first day following the end of the
fifteen (15) day period to the date such payment has been made at a rate per
annum equal to six percent (6%). Such interest shall be calculated daily on
the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Buyer may
elect to offset against any Deferred Consideration Payment otherwise due
(subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX), any Loss agreed to
by the Indemnifying Party or otherwise finally determined to be payable.

 



   Section 9.7 | Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. 
---|--- 

All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by
the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.



   Section 9.8 | Effect of Investigation. 
---|--- 

The representations, warranties and covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and
the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall
not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its Representatives) or
by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives
knew or should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or
might be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified Partys waiver of any
condition set forth in Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, as the case may be.



   Section 9.9 | Exclusive Remedies. 
---|--- 

Subject to Section 6.7 and Section 11.11, the parties acknowledge and agree
that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other
than claims arising from fraud on the part of a party hereto in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VII and
this Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action (including rights of contribution, if any), known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against the other parties
hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives
arising under or based upon any Law (including any such Law relating to
environmental matters or arising under or based upon any securities Law,
common Law or otherwise), except pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in Article VII and this Article IX. Nothing in this Section 9.9
shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to
which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any
Persons fraud.

Exhibit B

 

Stock Consideration 

 

At Buyers election, each of the following Management Members may be required
to accept, in lieu of cash, Innospec Stock for all (or such lesser portion as
Buyer may elect) of such Management Members allocable share of the Deferred
Consideration Payments payable to Seller pursuant to this Agreement:

 

Jeff Hibbeler

Corbin Barnes

 

Jeff Dawson

Jaime de los Santos

 

Mike Brown.

For purposes of the foregoing, a Management Members allocable share shall be
determined solely with reference to such Management Members "D" units in the
Seller. If Buyer elects to exercise the right to pay in Innospec Stock in lieu
of cash, then it will so notify Seller in writing, whereupon Seller shall
promptly inform Buyer, in writing, of each of such Management Members
allocable share of the applicable Deferred Consideration Payment, such that
Buyer can calculate the number of shares of Innospec Stock (valued at the
Innospec Stock Value) that will needed to be issued in lieu of cash. Any
Innospec Stock so issued to such Management Members will be credited (at the
Innospec Stock Value) against the cash otherwise owed to Seller with respect
to a Deferred Consideration Payment, and will be treated for all purposes as
a payment made to Seller, which was remitted directly to such Management
Member(s) at the direction of Seller.

 

Seller will not (i) redeem a Management Members "D" unit interests in Seller
prior to such Management Members receipt of his entire allocable share of
the Deferred Consideration Payments, (ii) otherwise effectuate, facilitate, or
consent to, any transfer of such Management Members "D" unit membership
interests in Seller, (iii) otherwise effectuate, facilitate, or consent to
any transaction or circumstance whereby such Management Members "D" units are
converted or reclassified into something other than "D" units in Seller, (iv)
revise the Seller LLC Agreement in a manner that has the effect of shifting a
Management Members allocable share of the Deferred Consideration Payments
from his or her "D" units to other units held by such Management Member, or
(v) otherwise take, or consent to, any action designed to frustrate the
intent of this provision. Seller represents Sellers LLC Agreement has not
been amended since the first amendment dated June 1, 2012, in any manner that
would be deemed a violation of this Exhibit B had the amendment occurred
subsequent to the execution of this Agreement. ---|---|---|---|---

("Company"), and the undersigned individual identified as the "Management
Member" on the signature page hereto (the "Management Member"). Capitalized
terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
to them in the Purchase Agreement (as defined below).

 

WHEREAS, the Company has entered into that certain Membership Interest
Purchase Agreement, dated even date herewith, by and among IOC Holdings, LLC
("Seller"), Innospec Oil Field Chemicals, LLC ("Buyer") and the Company (the
"Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, Buyer, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company, has agreed to purchase from Seller all of
the outstanding membership interest in Independence Oil Field Chemicals, LLC
(the "Transaction");

 

WHEREAS, Management Member is a member of Seller;

 

WHEREAS, the Purchase Agreement provides that a portion of the Deferred
Consideration Payments payable thereunder in respect of the
Management Members Class D Units may be paid directly to the Management
Member in the form of restricted and unregistered common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Company (the "Restricted Stock"); and

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to entering into the Purchase Agreement and closing
the Transaction, the parties to the Purchase Agreement have required that
Company and Management Member enter into this Agreement with respect to the
potential issuance of Restricted Stock to Management Member;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1\. _Acknowledgements_. Management Member hereby acknowledges and agrees that:
(i) at the election of Buyer, all or any portion of the Deferred
Consideration Payments to which Management Member is entitled with respect to
their Class D Units of the Seller, may be paid in the form of Restricted Stock
in lieu of cash, which Restricted Stock shall be valued at the Innospec Stock
Value for the purposes of calculating any such payment; (ii) any payment with
Restricted Stock will be effected through the issuance of electronic stock
certificates to a restricted shareholder account established
with Computershare for the benefit of the Management Member; (iii) Management
Member may receive more or less Restricted Stock than other Management Members
(as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement) in connection with any
Deferred Consideration Payments; and (iv) that other members of Seller may
receive benefit from Deferred Consideration Payments in forms that are
different from that received by Management Member, including cash or other
distributions from Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge and agree that in no event will Company issue  Restricted Stock in an amount that requires Company shareholder approval
under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635 or any successor provision and that the Company
will instead pay to the Management Member an equivalent amount of cash.
Management Member will not (i) sell his or her Class "D" Units in Seller prior
to such Management Members receipt of his or her entire allocable share of
the Deferred Consideration Payments, (ii) otherwise effectuate, facilitate,
or consent to, any transfer of such Management Members Class "D" membership
interests in Seller, (iii) otherwise effectuate, facilitate, or consent to any
transaction or circumstance whereby such Management Members "D" units are
converted or reclassified into something other than "D" units in Seller, or
(iv) otherwise take, or consent to, any action designed to frustrate the
intent of this provision.

the Companys sole discretion), directly or indirectly, Sell (as defined
below) any of such Restricted Stock issued for that Deferred Consideration
Period. Management Member also agrees that during the Restricted
Period, Management Member will not enter into any swap agreement, pledge
agreement, agreement to Sell or other arrangement that transfers to any other
person or entity any of the economic consequences of ownership of such
Restricted Stock which is subject to that particular Restricted Period.

b. Management Member further acknowledges and agrees that any Sale of
Restricted Stock issued to Management Member pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, regardless of whether the Restricted Period with respect to such
Restricted Stock shall have expired, shall be made only in accordance with all
applicable securities and other laws, including, without limitation, Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

c. Any attempt to Sell or effect any other transaction in violation of this
Agreement shall be null and void.

sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any
option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase,

contract to purchase, purchase of any option or contract to sell, grant of any
option, right or warrant to purchase, loan or other disposition or transfer)

standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, has all requisite power and

required reports, schedules, registration statements and other documents (the
"SEC Documents") required to be filed or furnished with the United States
Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). As of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, the SEC Documents complied as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Securities
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder applicable to such SEC Documents.

 

Unless Management Member receives prior written notice from Company otherwise,
and acknowledges and consents to the contents of such notice in writing,
each of the foregoing representations and warranties of the Company shall be
deemed to be made as of the date of any and each issuance of Restricted Stock
to Management Member pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, except that on such
subsequent dates, the phrase "Since December 31, 2011" in the representation
and warranty set forth in the first sentence of Section 3(c) be deemed to
change to since the date that is the end of the fiscal year that at such time

warranted to Management Member that such Restricted Stock was duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

4\. _Representations and Warranties of Management Member_. Management Member
hereby represents and warrants to Company as of the date hereof, and as a
condition to and upon the issuance of any Restricted Stock to Management
Member pursuant to the Purchase Agreement shall be deemed to have represented
and warranted, as follows:

 

a. Management Member is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a)
promulgated under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
because (i) he is a natural person whose individual net worth, or joint net
worth with his spouse, excluding the value of his primary residence, exceeds
$1,000,000 at the time of his purchase, and/or (ii) he is a natural person
who had an individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the two most
recent years or joint income with his spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of
those years and reasonably expects to reach the same income level in the
current year. 

b. Any Restricted Stock acquired by Management Member pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement is being acquired for investment for Management Members own
account only and without a view to distribution of such Restricted Stock.

c. No Restricted Stock issued to Management Member has been offered or sold
to Management Member by means of publicly disseminated advertisements, sales
literature

 



3  or other communication, and neither Company nor any person acting on its
behalf has offered or sold Management Member any Restricted Stock by means of
any form of general solicitation or general advertising.

d. Management Member has been made aware of and had the opportunity to review
the SEC Documents, and to ask and receive answers to questions in relation
thereto and to Companys business and operations, as well as to request and
receive all information Management Member considered relevant to an investment
in the Restricted Stock, and is aware of and understands fully the
information and disclosures contained therein with respect to Companys
business and prospects and an investment in the Restricted Stock.

 

e. Management Member has such knowledge and experience in financial, business
and tax matters that he is capable of evaluating the risks and merits of
making an investment in the Restricted Stock and, in making a decision whether
to proceed with such investment, has not relied on any representations or
warranties except as expressly made herein or in the Purchase Agreement.

 

f. Management Member is aware that an investment in Restricted Stock carries
significant risks and is able to bear the economic risks inherent in his
investment in the Company and can afford to lose the entire value of such an
investment.

g. Management Member understands that the Restricted Stock has not been
registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and are being
offered and sold in reliance upon exemptions provided in the Securities Act
and state securities laws for transactions not involving any public offering
and, therefore, cannot be resold or transferred unless they are subsequently
registered under the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws
or unless an exemption from such registration is available. Management
Member also understands that certificates representing the Restricted Stock

Target NWC Methodology

The Target NWC Percentage will be calculated as follows:



     | A. | For each month of the Twelve Month Measurement Period, the
percentage of NWC will be calculated relative to the prior three months
revenues for the Company and Sub (determined in accordance with GAAP
and consistent with the manner of preparation of the Financial Statements)
annualized (each being a monthly "NWC Percentage"). 
---|---|--- 
 

For example, the May 2015 NWC Percentage would be calculated as follows:

 



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    May 2015 NWC % |  | = |  | _$ NWC for month ending May 31,
2015_ 
   |  |  |  | 4 x (sum of March 2015, April 2015 and May 2015
Revenues) 
 

On a quarterly basis, Buyer will provide Seller with its calculation of the
NWC Percentage for each month of the Twelve Month Measurement Period and
shall provide Seller and its advisors and representatives reasonable access to
the books, records and other documents pertaining to or used in connection
with its calculations.

 



     | B. | The Target NWC Percentage will be calculated based on the
arithmetic average of the 12 monthly NWC Percentages for the Twelve Month
Measurement Period (the "Target NWC Percentage"). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | C. | The "Target NWC" would then be calculated as follows: 
---|---|--- 

Target NWC Percentage x the annualized trailing three month revenue for the
period ending on last day of calendar month that precedes the Closing, unless
the closing occurs on or after the 16th day of the calendar month, in which
event it will be an amount equal to the Target NWC Percentage x the annualized
trailing three month revenue for the period ending on the last day the
calendar month in which the Closing occurred. IOC HOLDINGS, LLC

otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the
Purchase Agreement.

_Fire Suppression_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Purchase Agreement, Seller covenants and agrees to cause the warehouse
properties owned by Company as of the date hereof (located in Pleasonton,
Texas, Midland, Texas and Williston, North Dakota) to be inspected on or
before the ninetieth (90th) day after Closing by a qualified third party
reasonably accepted to Seller and Buyer to determine whether the fire
suppression systems for such warehouses are in compliance with applicable
national guidelines and local law. If the same are determined by such third
party to be non-compliant, then Seller shall be solely responsible for any
associated costs reasonably incurred to bring such fire suppression systems
into compliance.

_401(k) Plan_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Purchase Agreement, Seller covenants and agrees that if there is a
"Qualification Failure," as defined in Revenue Procedure 2013-12, with respect
to the Independence Oilfield Chemicals 401(k) Plan (the " _Plan_ ") that
arises or has arisen from an action or failure to act occurring on or before

top heavy for 2013 or 2014, Seller will be solely responsible for any top
heavy contributions that need to be made with respect to the non-key employees
for 2013 and 2014, in accordance with Section 416 of the Code, and the IOC Holdings, LLC

non-key employees will equal 3% of the employees compensation (or if less,
the maximum percentage contributed on behalf of any key employee).

whether they otherwise contributed to the Plan.

 

 _Intellectual Property_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in the Purchase Agreement, Seller shall indemnify and defend each of

reason of any claim of infringement by [name removed] with respect to the
matter disclosed on Section 3.12(e) of the Disclosure Schedules.

 

 _Hard Standing for Totes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in the Purchase Agreement, Seller covenants and agrees to cause
the properties owned by Company as of the date hereof (located in Pleasonton,
Texas and Midland, Texas) to be inspected on or before the ninetieth (90th)
day after Closing by a qualified third party reasonably accepted to Seller and
Buyer to determine whether the hard standing surfaces on which the Company
stores its chemical totes are in compliance with applicable national
guidelines and local law. If the same are determined by such third party to be
non-compliant, then Seller shall be solely responsible for any associated
costs reasonably incurred in connection with ensuring that totes are stored in
compliance.

_Computer Software_. Finally, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the Purchase Agreement, Seller covenants and agrees to cause
Company and Sub prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after Closing to obtain all

manner as such business is conducted as of the date hereof: (i) [name

[name removed]. Seller shall be responsible for any associated costs incurred
in connection with obtaining such licenses. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the Company shall be solely responsible for the renewal fees for
any such licenses.

Except as expressly modified by this letter agreement, the Purchase Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect. This letter agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. In the event of termination of the
Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms, this letter agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party
