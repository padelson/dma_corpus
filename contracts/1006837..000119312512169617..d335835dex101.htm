acceleration, loss or Encumbrance that would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No material consent of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing

existing and in good standing under the Laws of Australia and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted,
except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing or in good
standing, or to have such power or authority, would not have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect. The Purchaser has made available to the Seller prior
to the date of this Agreement true and complete copies of the constitution of
the Purchaser, each as amended through the date hereof. The Purchaser is not
in violation of its constitution in any material respect.

 



14 4.2 Authority. The Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the

the Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions

part of the Purchaser are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Purchaser, and, assuming due authorization and delivery by
the Seller, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with its
terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (ii)
equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

4.3 No Conflict; Required Filings.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement do not and will not (i) contravene or conflict with the
constitution of the Purchaser, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters
referenced in Section 4.3(b), contravene or conflict with or constitute
a violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable to the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective properties or
assets or (iii) result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a
material benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, contract,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or license binding upon the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or result in the creation of any
Encumbrance (other than Permitted Encumbrances) upon any of the properties or
assets of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), any such contravention, conflict, violation, default,
termination, cancellation, acceleration, loss or Encumbrance that would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No material consent of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required to be obtained or made by the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than (i) if applicable, compliance with, filings
under and formal clearance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by the ACCC for the purposes of Part IV of the CC Act, (ii) if applicable,
filings with and approval from the FIRB for the purposes of the FAT Act, (iii)
confirmations to the ACMA that the Purchaser and all directors and officers of
the Purchaser are not disqualified entities or disqualified persons for the
purposes of the Telecom Act and (iv) those that, if not made or obtained,
individually or in the aggregate, would not materially hinder or materially
delay the Closing or reasonably be expected to result in a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.

 



15 4.4 Legal Proceedings. There are no claims, actions, suits, investigations
or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened,
against the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
properties or assets before any Governmental Authority, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

4.5 Financing; Guarantee.

 

(a) The Purchaser has provided the Seller with true, accurate and complete
copies of an executed debt commitment letter and related term sheets
excluding any details on any fees or interest rate terms payable by the
Purchaser (" _Financing Commitment_ ") from Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC
(the " _Lender_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions
of which, the Lender has committed to provide the Purchaser with loans in the
amounts described therein, the proceeds of which may be used to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Financing_ "). The
Financing Commitment is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser
and the other parties thereto. The Financing Commitment is in full force and
effect, and the Financing Commitment has not been withdrawn, rescinded or
terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and no such
amendment or modification is contemplated. The Purchaser is not in breach of
any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment, and
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach, default or failure to
satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. As of the date hereof, the
Purchaser is not aware of any fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to (A) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth
in the Financing Commitment inaccurate, (B) result in any of the conditions
in the Financing Commitment not being satisfied, (C) cause the Financing
Commitment to be ineffective or (D) otherwise result in the Financing not
being available on a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Lender has not
notified the Purchaser of its intention to terminate the Financing Commitment
or not to provide the Financing. The net proceeds from the Financing will be
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to pay any fees and expenses of or payable by the Purchaser in connection
therewith. The Purchaser has paid in full any and all commitment or other
fees required by the Financing Commitment that are due as of the date hereof,
and will pay, after the date hereof, all such commitments and fees as they
become due. There are no side letters, understandings or other agreements or
arrangements relating to the Financing to which the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates are a party. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or
the conditions precedent thereto, other than as set forth in the Financing
Commitment (the " _Disclosed Conditions_ "). No Person has any right to
impose, and none of the Lender or the Purchaser has any obligation to accept,
any condition precedent to such funding other than the Disclosed Conditions
nor any reduction to the aggregate amount available under

 



16  the Financing Commitment on the Closing Date (nor any term or condition
which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under
the Financing Commitment on the Closing Date). The Purchaser has no reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any conditions to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing, or that the Financing will
not be available to the Purchaser on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement for the Purchaser
to obtain the Financing or any alternative financing.

(b) If the Purchaser secures alternative funding arrangements with another
party or parties (the " _New Lender"_ ) prior to Closing (the " _New
Financing_ "), it may provide the Seller with true, accurate and complete
copies of the executed debt commitment letter and related term sheets (the "
_New Financing Commitment"_ ) in respect of such New Financing, and if the
Seller is satisfied (acting reasonably) with the New Financing, the New
Financing Commitment and the New Lender and communicates such satisfaction to
the Purchaser (in writing), then from the time of that written communication a
reference in this Agreement to:

 

(i) the "Lender" will be deemed to be a reference to the "New Lender";

 

(ii) the "Financing" will be deemed to be a reference to the "New Financing";
and

 

(iii) the "Financing Commitment" will be deemed to be a reference to the "New
Financing Commitment". 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, and without limitation, the parties agree that
the Seller would be acting reasonably for the purposes of clause 4.5(b) if
the Seller was not satisfied with New Financing on the basis that the New
Financing would cause a delay to Closing.

4.6 Finders Fee. Neither the Seller nor the Company nor any of their
respective stockholders, members, option holders, directors, managers,
officers or Affiliates will incur any liability to any party for any
brokerage or finders fee or agents commission, or the like, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of the Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 

4.7 No Additional Warranties; No Representations.

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges that it and its representatives (i) have
received access to such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts
and other assets of the Seller, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries
which it and its representatives have desired or requested to review, (ii)
have had access to the Data Site, (iii) have conducted an independent
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) have had full opportunity to meet with
the management of the Seller, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries and

ACCC, the ACMA, the FIRB, state antitrust enforcement authorities or any
competition authorities, regulatory authorities or national security
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other Person
may assert under any applicable Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate

 



21  each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible, including, without limitation (X) proposing, negotiating, committing
to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of the
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and (Y) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after
the Closing Date would limit the freedom of the Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries (including the Companys and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
its or its Subsidiaries (including the Companys or its
Subsidiaries) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the Closing, and (iv) subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Authority, keep each other apprised of the
status of and cooperate with each other with respect to matters relating to
the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly

their respective Affiliates, from any third party and/or any Governmental
Authority with respect to such transactions.

(c) Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall permit counsel for the other
party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Authority. Each of the Seller and the
Purchaser agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion,
either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate. Upon receipt of prior notice thereof, each of the Seller and
the Purchaser shall ensure that its appropriate officers and employees shall
be available to attend, as the other party or the applicable Governmental
Authority may request, any scheduled hearings or meetings in connection with
the matters addressed by this Section 5.2. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 5.2, materials provided to the other party or its
outside counsel may be redacted to remove any estimate of the valuation of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or the Business, or the identities of other
potential acquirers. Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall take
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this Section 5.2 so as to preserve any
applicable privilege.

(d) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser shall
not, and the Purchaser shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any action
(including any acquisition of businesses or assets) which would reasonably be
expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement due to the actions of any Governmental Authority.

 



22 (e) The Purchaser will, and the Seller will procure that Primus
Telecommunications Inc does, use best endeavours to negotiate in good faith a
"Transition Service Agreement" between the Purchaser and Primus
Telecommunications Inc, a working but un-negotiated draft of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit A. The Purchaser and the Seller agree that the terms of the
final "Transition Services Agreement" shall include a term of 180 days and
that the services will be provided (where commercial arrangements are
currently in place) on terms that are no less favourable than the terms
currently in place between Primus Telecommunications Inc and the Company or
its Subsidiaries at the date of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt the
parties expressly acknowledge that finalization and execution of
the "Transition Services Agreement" is not a condition to Closing.

5.4 Financing

 

(a) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its
best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Financing Commitment, including using its best efforts to (i) comply with
its obligations under the Financing Commitment, (ii) maintain in effect the
Financing Commitment, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the Financing Commitment on terms and conditions no less
favorable to the Purchaser than those contained in the Financing Commitment,
(iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the Purchaser
contained in the Financing Commitment (or any definitive agreements related
thereto), including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement
fees required as a condition to the Financing, (v) enforce all of its rights
under the Financing Commitment (or any definitive agreements related thereto)
and (vi) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing Date (it being
understood that it is not a condition to the Closing under this Agreement, nor
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, for the
Purchaser to obtain the Financing or any alternative financing). The Purchaser
shall keep the Seller informed on a reasonable basis and in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (including providing
the Seller with copies of all definitive agreements and other documents
related to the Financing). The Purchaser shall give the Seller prompt notice
upon becoming aware of any breach by any party of either of the Financing
Commitment or any termination of the Financing Commitment. The Purchaser shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Seller, amend, modify,
supplement or waive any of the conditions or contingencies to
funding contained in the Financing Commitment (or any definitive agreements
related thereto) or any other provision of, or remedies under, the Financing
Commitment (or any definitive agreements related thereto), in each case to the
extent such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver could reasonably be
expected to have the effect of (A) adversely affecting the ability of the
Purchaser to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or (B) amending, modifying, supplementing or waiving the conditions or
contingencies to the Financing in a manner materially adverse to the Seller.
In the event all conditions applicable to the Financing Commitment have been
satisfied, the Purchaser shall use its best efforts to cause the Lender to
fund the Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including by taking enforcement action to cause the persons
providing the Financing to fund such Financing). In the event that
any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, the

 



23  Purchaser shall notify the Seller and use its best efforts to arrange
alternative financing from the same or other sources on terms and conditions
not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Purchaser than those
contained in the Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, and in an amount
sufficient to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 

(b) The Seller will, and will cause the Company to, at the Purchasers sole
expense, cooperate reasonably with the Purchaser and its authorized
representatives in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, including
(i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings on reasonable advance
notice, (ii) furnishing information (including financial
statements) reasonably required to be included in the preparation of offering
memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents,
and (iii) cooperation in respect of the preparation of any underwriting or
placement agreements, pledge and security documents and other definitive
financing documents; provided that the Company shall not be required to become
subject to any obligations with respect to such agreements or documents prior
to the Closing. Any information provided to the Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 5.3(b) shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. The
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Seller, the Company and their
respective Affiliates and representatives shall not have any responsibility
for, or incur any liability to any Person under or in connection with, the
arrangement of the Financing or any alternative financing that the Purchaser
may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that the Purchaser shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates and
representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or any alternative
financing and any information utilized in connection therewith.

 



24 5.5 Confidentiality; Access to Information

 

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges that the information Made Available to it by
the Seller and its Affiliates (or their respective agents or representatives)
is subject to the terms of that certain Confidentiality and Standstill
Agreement, dated as of 31 October 2011, by and between the Purchaser and the
Primus Telecommunications Group, Incorporated (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the confidentiality
and non-disclosure provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate
with respect to "Evaluation Material" (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or the Business;
provided, however, that the Purchaser hereby further acknowledges and agrees
that its confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations in
the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate only with respect to such
"Evaluation Material" relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or the
Business and that any and all other "Evaluation Material" provided or Made
Available to it by the Seller or its Affiliates (or their respective agents
or representatives) concerning the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Company, its Subsidiaries and/or the Business) shall remain subject to the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms to the extent not modified by this Section
5.4(a).

(b) Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Seller shall, subject to
compliance with applicable Laws and any Contracts to which the Seller or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) is a party,
provide the Purchaser access and the opportunity to make such investigation of
the management, employees, properties, businesses and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and such examination and provision
of information relating to the books, records and financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, as it reasonably requests including regular
meetings (as agreed by the Seller acting reasonably) with senior Employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that neither the Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to disclose to the Purchaser or
any agent or representative of the Purchaser any information if it believes in
good faith that doing so could result in a loss of the ability to
successfully assert a claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and
work product privileges) or such disclosure would violate any applicable Law
or contractual requirement. Any such investigation and examination will be
conducted under reasonable circumstances after appropriate advance notice and
in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
Business. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) shall affect any
warranty by the Seller in this Agreement or any condition to the obligations
of the Purchaser hereunder. Neither the Purchaser nor any of its
representatives shall be permitted to perform any onsite procedure (including
any onsite environmental study) with respect to any property of the Company
or its Subsidiaries.

5.6 Public Announcements. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to issue a joint
press release announcing this Agreement. The Seller and the Purchaser will
consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance
of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
press release or other 

 



25  public statement or comment prior to such consultation except, in each case,
as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with, or requirement of, the New York Stock Exchange, in the case
of the Seller or its Affiliates or requirements of, the Australian Securities
Exchange in the case of the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without
the prior consent of the Purchaser, the Seller may, and may cause the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries to disseminate the information included in a press
release or other document previously approved for external distribution by the
Purchaser.

 

5.7 Books and Records.

(a) The Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the Purchaser at Closing all properties, books, records,
Contracts, information and documents relating primarily to the Business that
are not then in the possession or control of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Seller
will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Purchaser any
remaining properties, books, records, Contracts, information and documents
relating primarily to the Business that are not already in the possession or
control of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Subject to Section 7.2(a) (relating to the preservation of Tax records),
the Seller and the Purchaser agree that each of them will preserve and keep
the books of accounts, financial and other records held by it relating to the
Business (including accountants work papers) for a period of six (6) years
from the Closing Date in accordance with their respective corporate records
retention policies; provided, however, that prior to disposing of any such
records in accordance with such policies (if such records would be disposed of
prior to the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date), the applicable
party shall provide written notice to the other party of its intent to
dispose of such records and shall provide such other party the opportunity to
take ownership and possession of such records (at such other partys sole
expense) to the extent they relate to such other partys business or
obligations within thirty (30) days after such notice is delivered. If such
other party does not confirm its intention in writing to take ownership and
possession of such records within such thirty (30) day period, the party who
possesses the records may proceed with the disposition of such records. The
Seller and the Purchaser shall make such records, other information relating
to the Business, employees and auditors available to the other as may be
reasonably required by such party (i) in connection with, among other things,
any audit or investigation of, insurance claims by, legal proceedings against,
disputes involving or governmental investigations of the Seller or
the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) in order to enable
the Seller or the Purchaser to comply with their respective obligations under
this Agreement and each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated
hereby or thereby or (iii) for any other reasonable business purpose relating
to the Seller, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates.

5.8 Further Action. From time to time after the Closing Date, and for no
further consideration, each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver such
assignments, transfers,

 



26  consents, assumptions and other documents and instruments and take such
other actions as may reasonably be necessary to appropriately consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including (a) transferring back to the
Seller or its designated Affiliates any asset or liability which was
inadvertently transferred to, or held by, the Company or its Subsidiaries at
the Closing, (b) transferring to the Purchaser any asset or liability
contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred to the Purchaser and which
was not so transferred at the Closing and (c) remitting promptly to the Seller
or the Purchaser, as the case may be, any cash amounts actually received
for accounts receivable of the Business generated prior to the Closing Date,
in the case of the Seller, or on or after the Closing Date, in the case of the
Purchaser.

5.9 Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring or required to incur such expenses; provided, however, that all fees
paid in respect of the CC Act, the FAT Act, the Telecom Act or other
regulatory filings shall be borne by the Purchaser.

 

5.10 Notice of Developments. Each party shall give prompt written notice to
the other party of any statement or information contained in such partys
warranties that is incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect. Nothing
in this Agreement, including this Section 5.9, shall be interpreted or
construed to imply that the Seller is making any warranty as of any date
other than as otherwise set forth herein. During the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Closing, the Seller shall be entitled to update the
Disclosure Letter to the extent information contained therein or any warranty
of the Seller becomes untrue or incomplete or inaccurate after the date
hereof due to events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof. If the
Closing occurs, any such update shall be deemed to have amended the Disclosure
Letter, to have qualified the relevant warranties contained in Article III
and to have cured any breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed
hereunder by reason of such event or circumstance.

5.11 Indebtedness; Intercompany Accounts. No later than one day prior to the
Closing Date, (a) the Seller shall discharge (or otherwise cause to be
extinguished), to the extent practicable, any and all Indebtedness for
borrowed money of the Company or its Subsidiaries owed to any Person and (b)
the Seller shall, at no cost to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
terminate or cancel any and all intercompany accounts and Contracts
(excluding ordinary course arms length trade payables and receivables)
between the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand.

5.12 Waiver of Conflicts and Attorney-Client Privilege.

 

The Purchaser hereby waives, on its own behalf, and agrees to cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to waive, (a) any conflicts that may arise in
connection with any legal counsel that represents the Seller or the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement (the " _Current
Representation_ ") so that such counsel may undertake after the Closing the
representation of the Seller , or any current officer,

 



27  director, employee, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of the Company
or its Subsidiaries (a " _Post-C_ _losing Representation_ ") and (b) their
rights of attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between
such counsel and the Seller or any such officer, director, employee, manager,
member, stockholder or Affiliate occurring during the Current Representation
in connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including for both (a)
and (b) in connection with a dispute with the Purchaser on or following the
Closing.

5.13 Insurances.

Until the Closing Date the Seller will maintain, or cause there to be
maintained, insurance on the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
comprising insurance no less than that taken out by the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement and will not cause or permit, nor
cause nor permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to cause or permit such
insurance to lapse or be cancelled prior to the Closing Date.

Purchaser after Closing, in respect of which the Purchaser may seek to make
any Claim or Action against the Seller (any such claim, demand, action or
proceeding being hereinafter called a "Third Party Claim"), the following
procedure applies (but does not (for the avoidance of doubt) operate in any
way to increase the liability of the Seller for a breach of the Warranties or
under the indemnity in section 10.1):

(a) the Purchaser will give prompt written notice of the Third Party Claim to
the Seller and will consult with the Seller concerning such claim provided,
however, that the failure to give such notice does not relieve the Seller of
its obligations under this Agreement unless the ability of the Seller to
defend the Third Party Claim is materially impaired as a result of such
failure to give notice;

 



42 (b) the Purchaser will not themselves, nor allow the Company or its
Subsidiaries, to admit, compromise, settle or pay any Third Party Claim or
take any other steps which may in any way prejudice the defence of the Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Seller, except as may be
reasonably required in order to prevent any judgment against the Company or
its Subsidiaries or where the Seller has not agreed within 30 business days
after receiving notice under paragraph (a) to defend the Third Party Claim or
is not proceeding with such defence in good faith; 

(c) if and so long as the Seller has agreed to defend the Third Party Claim
and is proceeding with such defence in good faith, the Purchaser will or will
procure that the Company or its Subsidiaries will, permit the Seller at the
expense of the Seller to take such reasonable action in the name of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to defend or otherwise settle the Third Party
Claim as the Seller may reasonably require provided that the legal counsel
engaged by the Seller to conduct the defence is acceptable to the Purchaser
(acting reasonably) and the Purchaser may participate in the defence at their
expense; and 

(d) the Purchaser will ensure that the Seller and its representatives are
given reasonable access at the Sellers expense to such of the documents and
records of the Company or its Subsidiaries and of the Purchaser as are in the
possession or under the control of the Purchaser, the Company or its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably required by the Seller in relation to any
action taken or proposed to be taken by the Seller under Section 10.8(c).

10.7 Further Indemnity. 

Without limiting any other clause of this Agreement, the Seller will indemnify
and keep indemnified and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against any and
all Loss incurred or suffered by or brought or made against the Purchaser, the
Company or its Subsidiaries which arises from any action or claim brought by
any third party in relation to or as a consequence of any agreement or
understanding entered into by the Seller, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
of the Affiliates with that third party in respect of:

(a) the sale or proposed sale of the Shares (or any part of them), the shares
of any of the Subsidiaries or the assets and undertaking of the Company or its
Subsidiaries; or

 

(b) any negotiation or discussions or solicitation in respect of the matters
referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section.

referred to in this Section.

rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

14.4 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, including
all exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement and supersede any and all other prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between or among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and do
not, and are not intended to, confer upon any Person (other than the
Purchaser and the Seller) any rights or remedies hereunder.

14.5 Amendment; Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in
the case of an amendment, by the Seller and the Purchaser, or in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. Any party
may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the warranties
of any other party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or acts of any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by
any other party hereto with any of the agreements contained herein or, except
as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such partys conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Seller or the
Purchaser in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder.

 

14.6 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

14.7 Disclosure Letter. The Disclosure Letter shall be construed with and as
an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if the same had been
set forth verbatim herein.

 

14.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of Victoria, Australia, without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of Victoria, Australia or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than Victoria, Australia.

 



56 14.9 Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns,
shall be brought or otherwise commenced in any court in Victoria, Australia.
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts
and courts competent to hear appeals from such courts and agrees that it will
not bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law), and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this Section 14.9, (ii) any claim that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise) and (iii) any claim that (A) the action or proceeding
in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such
action or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such court. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that notice or the service of process in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be properly served or
delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by Section 14.1. Each of the
parties agrees that any Government Order or court judgment obtained may be
enforced in any court in the United States. 

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY
WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW) ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. FURTHER, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY OR PERSON WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF
RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY THIS
SECTION 14.9(b).

14.10 Construction. The headings of Articles and Sections in this Agreement
are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or

by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict

14.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including
by facsimile or electronic transmission), each of which shall be an original,
with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the
same instrument, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered (by facsimile, electronic
