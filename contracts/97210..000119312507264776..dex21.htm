\- iv - _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this " _Agreement_
"), dated as of December 11, 2007 by and among Teradyne, Inc.,, a
Massachusetts corporation (" _Parent_ "), NAC Equipment Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Purchaser_ "), and Nextest Systems Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
" _Company_ ").

_RECITALS:_

A. The Board of Directors of, or authorized committee thereof, each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company has approved, and deems it advisable and in
the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the
acquisition of the Company by Parent upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

B. In furtherance thereof and pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser has agreed
to commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company (the " _Shares_ ") at a
price per Share of $20.00 (such amount or any different amount per Share that
may be paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Offer Price_ "), subject to any withholding of Taxes required by Law, net to
the seller in cash upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

C. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a
condition and inducement to Parents and Purchasers willingness to enter into
this Agreement, the stockholders of the Company listed on _Schedule A_ have
entered into Stockholders Agreements, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (collectively, the "
_Stockholder Agreement_ "), pursuant to which such stockholders have, among
other things, agreed to tender their Shares in the Offer and have given
Purchaser a proxy to vote all of the shares of capital stock of the Company
that such stockholders own.

D. Following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser will be merged with and into
the Company with the Company as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ ",
and together with the Offer and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the " _Transactions_ "), in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), whereby each issued and
outstanding Share not owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or the
Company will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash.

E. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of Directors_
") has unanimously, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein: (i) determined that the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders;
(ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger; and
(iii) determined to recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the
Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser and, to the extent applicable, adopt
this Agreement. F. The Board of Directors of, or authorized committee thereof, Parent and
Purchaser have, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
unanimously declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger.

G. Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to (i) make certain
representations and warranties in connection with the Offer and the
Merger; (ii) make certain covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger; and (iii) prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND MERGER

Section 1.1 The Offer. 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8.1, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within 10 Business Days) after the
date hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase for cash all Shares (other than
Restricted Stock) at the Offer Price, subject to:

(i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn prior to any
then scheduled Expiration Date (as defined below) that number of
Shares which, together with the Shares then beneficially owned by Parent or
Purchaser (if any), represents in the aggregate a majority of such Shares
outstanding on a fully diluted basis on the date of purchase (where "on a
fully diluted basis" means the number of Shares outstanding, together with
the Restricted Stock and the shares of Common Stock which the Company may be
required to issue pursuant to the exercise, conversion or exchange of any
Company Options, RSUs, Equity Interests or other rights to acquire Shares
then outstanding, whether or not vested or then exercisable) (the " _Minimum
Condition_ "); and

(ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the other
conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_.

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for any Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to
the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by
Parent or Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in
_Annex I_. Subject to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the
satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Purchaser of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in  _Annex I_ , Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and
accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after Purchaser is legally
permitted to do so under applicable Law. The Offer Price payable in respect of
each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
paid net to the seller in cash, and without interest, subject to withholding
as provided in Section 2.2(e).



 

\- 2 - (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum
Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_.
Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price
or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or
as previously approved by the Company in writing, Purchaser shall not (i)
decrease the Offer Price; (ii) change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer; (iii) reduce the number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer;
(iv) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer that are different than or
in addition to the conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ ; (v)
amend or waive the Minimum Condition; (vi) amend any other terms of the Offer
set forth in this Agreement in any manner materially adverse to the holders of
Shares, or (vii) extend the expiration of the Offer in a manner other than
set forth at Section 1.1(e) hereof.

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date
that is 20 Business Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date to which
the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later
date to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, is referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ ").

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows:

(i) _Offer Conditions Not Satisfied_. If on or prior to any then scheduled
Expiration Date, all of the conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum
Condition and all other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ )
shall not have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted
hereunder, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the
Offer for periods of up to 10 Business Days each until the earlier of (x) the
date on which the Minimum Condition has been met and all of the conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_ are satisfied or waived or (y) the date
on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1.

(ii) _Required by Applicable Law or Nasdaq_. Purchaser shall extend the Offer
for any period or periods required by applicable Law, rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC (or its staff) or Nasdaq.

(f) Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering
period" in accordance with Rule 14d-l1 under the Exchange Act as provided for
below. In the event that more than 80% of the then outstanding Shares have
been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
following the Expiration Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) provide for a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of at least 10 Business Days immediately
following the Expiration Date unless Parent and Purchaser exercise the 90%
Top-Up Option. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for
payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered and not validly  



 

\- 3 -  withdrawn pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering period"
promptly after any such Shares are tendered during such "subsequent offering
period". The Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a "subsequent
offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this Section 1.1(f).

(g) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company except in the
event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1. In
the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto.

(h) On the date of the commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Purchaser shall file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), pursuant to Regulation M-A
under the Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_ "), a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO
shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively, together with any
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and
Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to
be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company further represents
that, as of the date of this Agreement, Merrill Lynch, the Companys
financial advisor, has delivered to the Company Board of Directors its written
opinion that, as of the date of this Agreement, the consideration to be
received by the holders of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is
fair to such holders from a financial point of view and has agreed not to
unreasonably withhold its consent to include such written opinion in the
Schedule 14D-9 so long as the full text of such opinion is reproduced therein
and Merrill Lynch has approved in advance the text of any accompanying
disclosure. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it in
writing for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law. Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected
(if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and
Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to all the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral
responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses and Parent and Purchaser
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated prior to
the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall promptly return, and
shall cause any depository, acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.



  

\- 4 - (i) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(j) Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all
information concerning Parent, Purchaser and the Offer that may be required by
applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested by Company for inclusion in
the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed by the Company.

Section 1.2 Company Actions.

(a) Except and to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.2 hereof, the
Company Board of Directors shall: (i) recommend that the holders of the Shares
accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and,
if necessary under applicable Law, adopt this Agreement in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the " _Company Recommendation_ "); and
(ii) include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, as described
below, and permit Parent to include the Company Recommendation in the Offer
Documents.

(b) Contemporaneous with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in
a manner that complies with Rule 14D-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "). The Company further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it in writing for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as
otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable),
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9
before it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration
to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and
shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments, and any
written or oral responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the
Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel.



 

\- 5 - (c) The Company shall promptly furnish to Purchaser in writing all information
concerning the Company that may be required by applicable securities Laws or
reasonably requested by Purchaser for inclusion in the Schedule TO or the
Offer Documents.

(d) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall promptly
furnish or cause to be furnished to Purchaser or its designated agent mailing
labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer
files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares
as of the most recent practicable date, together with copies of all lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all other
information in the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial
owners of the Shares, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such
information and assistance (including, but not limited to, lists of holders of
the Shares, updated promptly from time to time upon Purchasers request, and
their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions) as Purchaser
or its agent may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer
to, and seeking approval of the Merger from, the record and beneficial
holders of the Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, until consummation of
the Offer, Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in any
such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection
with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated,
upon the Companys request Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Company or,
at Purchasers option, destroy, all copies of such information.

Section 1.3 Directors.

(a) Promptly after Purchaser first accepts for payment any Shares tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the " _Appointment Time_ "), and from
time to time thereafter as Shares are accepted for payment by Purchaser,
Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board of Directors as is
equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board of
Directors (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Purchaser
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate
number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and any of its
affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding; provided
that in no event shall the number of Purchaser designees constitute less than
a majority of the Company Board of Directors. The Company shall, upon
Purchasers request at any time following the purchase of and payment for
Shares pursuant to the Offer, take such actions, including but not limited to
promptly (and in any event to the extent reasonably practicable within one (1)
Business Day) filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company
Board of Directors, promptly (and in any event to the extent reasonably
practicable within one Business Day) increasing the size of the Company Board
of Directors (including by amending the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Certificate_ "), the Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ", and together with
the Company Certificate, the " _Company Governing Documents_ ") of the Company
if necessary so as to increase the size of the Company Board of Directors)
and/or promptly (and in any event to the extent reasonably practicable within
one Business Day) securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent
directors as are necessary or desirable to enable Purchasers designees to be
so elected or designated to the Company Board of  



 

\- 6 -  Directors, and shall use its best efforts to cause Purchasers designees to
be so elected or designated at such time. Any and all members of the
Company Board of Directors immediately prior to such appointments by Parent
who remain on the Company Board after such appointments by Parent shall be
referred to as " _Continuing Directors_ " and each a " _Continuing Director_
". The Company shall, upon Purchasers request following the Appointment
Time, also cause Persons elected or designated by Purchaser to constitute the
same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company
Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the Company Board of Directors,
(ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of the
Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each
case to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the Marketplace Rules of
the Nasdaq Global Market (the " _Nasdaq_ "). The Company shall promptly upon
execution of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3(a), including mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9)
the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to
enable Purchasers designees to be elected or designated to the Company Board
of Directors. Purchaser shall supply the Company with information with respect
to Purchasers designees and Parents and Purchasers respective officers,
directors and affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not
limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a
matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the Company
Board of Directors prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.3(a)

Proxy Statement be in a form ready to print and mail to the stockholders of
the Company as promptly as practicable following the Appointment Time and the

misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law,
and the Company further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected
(if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and, if any such correction is made
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement as provided in Section

required by the Exchange Act or the SEC (or its staff).



 

\- 9 - (b) The Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors, shall, in
accordance with and subject to the requirements of applicable Law:

(i) (A) as promptly as practicable following the Appointment Time and the

(the " _Short Form Threshold_ "), following the Appointment Time and the
expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by Purchaser pursuant
to and in accordance with this Agreement, if applicable, and the exercise of
the 90% Top-Up Option, if applicable, Parent shall cause the Merger to become

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders of any securities of the Company or common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "):

(a) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Purchaser
Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



 

\- 10 - (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are owned by the Company and any Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser or any of
their respective subsidiaries or affiliates shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.5(b) below, each issued
and outstanding Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time,
all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest thereon.

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company to act
as the payment agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "),
which Paying Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration. Such
funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its
sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of
the Shares. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit
of holders of Shares.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and whose Shares
were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Such letter and instructions can be
faxed to the holder of record upon request. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the  



 

\- 11 -  Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such payment shall be
made to the holder of record by bank check; provided that any holder of
record entitled to a payment in excess of $500,000 shall have the right to
receive payment by electronic wire transfer, in which case payment shall be
made net of any applicable wire transfer fees. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that: (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer; and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax
either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without
interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six months
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying
Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the relevant Merger Consideration or Offer Price otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts that Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is  



 

\- 12 -  required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash held
by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_
, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to (i) direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the U.S. government, (ii) commercial paper obligations receiving
the highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or (iii) money market funds
invested solely in any of the foregoing, or a combination thereof; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the value of the cash held by the Paying
Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2 is reduced below the amount necessary to
pay any unpaid Merger Consideration, Parent shall immediately deposit
additional funds with the Paying Agent sufficient to correct this deficiency.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the
property of Parent and paid to Parent upon demand.

Section 2.3 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead the holder of
such Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights. At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of the
Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
dissent under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.



 

\- 13 - (b) The Company shall serve prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands received
by the Company for dissenters rights of any Shares, and Purchaser shall have
the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect
to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand,
or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.4 Top-Up Option.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _90%
Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, to purchase, at a price per share equal to the
Offer Price, payable in cash, that number of shares of Common Stock (the "
_90% Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lesser of: (x) the lowest number of
shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Common
Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser and their respective subsidiaries at
the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the
shares of Common Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis (after giving
effect to the issuance of the 90% Top-Up Option Shares); and (y) an aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock in excess of the Companys total authorized
and unissued shares of Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the 90%
Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise
and the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, the Short Form
Threshold would be reached (assuming the issuance of the 90% Top-Up Option
Shares) and (ii) if the number of 90% Top-Up Option Shares issued equals or
exceeds 20% of the number of the issued and outstanding Shares as of the date
hereof all of the conditions set forth in Article VII must be satisfied or
waived (other than those that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the
time of the Closing).

(b) Provided that no applicable Law or other legal impediment shall prohibit
the exercise of the 90% Top-Up Option or the issuance of the 90% Top-
Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or
issuance illegal, Purchaser may exercise the 90% Top-Up Option, in whole but
not in part, at any one time after the Appointment Time and prior to the
earlier to occur of: (i) the Effective Time; and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

(c) In the event Purchaser wishes to exercise the 90% Top-Up Option,
Purchaser shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _90% Top-Up Exercise
Notice_ ", the date of which notice is referred to herein as the " _90% Top-Up
Notice Date_ ") specifying the denominations of the certificate or
certificates evidencing the 90% Top-Up Option Shares which Purchaser wishes to
receive, and the place, time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale
pursuant to the 90% Top-Up Option (the " _90% Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company
shall, promptly after receipt of the 90% Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a
written notice to Purchaser confirming the number of 90% Top-Up Option Shares
and the aggregate purchase price therefor (the " _90% Top-Up Notice Receipt_
"). At the 90% Top-Up Closing, Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate
price required to be paid for the 90% Top-Up Option Shares and the Company
shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate or certificates
representing the 90%  



 

\- 14 -  Top-Up Option Shares. The purchase price for the 90% Top-Up Option Shares
may be paid by Purchaser, at its election, either in cash or by executing
and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount
equal to such purchase price, or by any combination of cash and such
promissory note. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the
applicable federal rate determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code, shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. Such
certificates may include any legends that are required by federal or state
securities Laws. Parent and Purchaser understand that the Shares which
Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the 90% Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, or will
be upon the purchase of the 90% Top-Up Option Shares, an Accredited Investor,
as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.
Purchaser agrees that the 90% Top-Up Option and the 90% Top-Up Option Shares
to be acquired upon exercise of the 90% Top-Up Option are being and will be
acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or
for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of
the Securities Act.

Section 2.5 Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock and Other Equity Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Common Stock
granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable, shall be assumed and converted automatically at
the Effective Time into an option to acquire shares of Parent Stock, on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Option (including vesting schedule) except that (i) the number of
shares of Parent Stock subject to each such option or right shall be
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction (the "
_Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the Merger
Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price of
Parent Stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the five consecutive trading
days immediately preceding (but not including) the Closing Date (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant
to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y)
the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of a Company Option
an appropriate notice setting forth the terms of such assumption and
conversion. With respect to any Company Option that is an "incentive stock
option" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the parties hereto intend that such assumption and
conversion shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, conform to the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

(b) At the Effective Time, (i) each share of Restricted Stock which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
upon the expiration of the applicable vesting or other lapse restrictions, and
shall remain subject to the same forfeiture or repurchase conditions in effect
on the date hereof and (ii) any repurchase rights in favor of the Company
with respect to Restricted Stock and unvested shares of Common Stock issued
pursuant to the exercise of Company Options shall be assigned to any successor
to the Company, including Parent. 



 

\- 15 - (c) At the Effective Time, each RSU that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by Parent and converted
automatically into a Parent restricted stock unit. Each RSU so assumed and
converted will continue to have, and be subject to, substantially the same
terms and conditions, except that each converted RSU shall be for that number
of whole shares of Parent Stock equal to the product of the number of shares
of Common Stock that were subject to the RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (rounded down
to the nearest whole share).

(d) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Company Stock Rights pursuant to this Section 2.5, including the reservation,
issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.5. Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares
of Parent Stock subject to the assumed Company Stock Rights prior to the 15th
day following the Effective Time.

(e) All amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.5 shall be paid without
interest and shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes that Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
shall be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or
any provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the Restricted Stock and RSUs in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent.

leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized,
validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or

another Subsidiary of the Company free and clear of all Liens and (ii) have

this Section 5.2(a) by any director, officer, legal counsel, financial
advisor, accountant or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
willful and knowing violation by any other Representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.2(a), at any time
prior to the Appointment Time, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Alternative Proposal received after the date hereof that the

with its outside counsel and nationally recognized independent
financial advisors, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal, that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2, and subject
to compliance with Section 5.2(e), (i) furnish non-public information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person or group making

participate in discussions or negotiations with such person or group and their
respective Representatives regarding such Alternative Proposal.

(c) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)

(v) resolve to propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board of Directors may withdraw,
modify or qualify the Company Recommendation (a " _Change of Company
Recommendation_ ") if, prior to the Appointment Time, the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith that (A) in the absence of any breach of
the Companys obligations under this Section 5.2 an unsolicited bona fide
written Alternative Proposal received by the Company constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (B) other than in response to an Alternative Proposal and
following consultation with outside counsel that the exercise of its fiduciary
duties so require, but in any such case (whether described by the foregoing
clause (A) or clause (B)) (1) only after the third Business Day following
Parents receipt of written notice (an " _Adverse Recommendation Notice_ ")
advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors desires to effect a Change
of Company Recommendation (and the manner and timing in which it intends to
do so), and the Company provides Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and negotiates in
good faith with Parent with respect thereto during the three Business Day
period after Parent has received the Adverse Recommendation Notice, in each
case as would enable the Company Board of Directors or committee thereof to
proceed with the Company Recommendation; and (2) if such Adverse
Recommendation Notice is due to the existence of a Superior Proposal, the
Company has complied with the requirements of Section 5.2(e), including
without limitation specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal,
and Parent shall not have within three Business Days of the receipt of the
Adverse Recommendation Notice made an offer or proposal that the Company Board
of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its nationally
recognized independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel) to be at
least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal
(with any change to the financial or other material terms of such Superior
Proposal requiring a new Adverse Recommendation Notice to the Buyer and a new
three Business Day period as described in this paragraph) . Nothing in this
Section 5.2(c) shall be deemed to permit the Company to take any action
described in clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the first sentence of this
Section 5.2(c) unless it has terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(a)(iii) and paid to Parent the fees specified in Section 8.2(b).

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from: (i) disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) pending disclosure of its position thereunder; or (ii) making
any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Company Board of Directors to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary obligations to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(e) The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of: (i) any Alternative Proposal or any
inquiries, proposals or offers reasonably expected to lead to an Alternative
Proposal; (ii) any request for information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with or reasonably expected to be related to an
Alternative Proposal; and (iii) any inquiry or request for discussion or
negotiation that would reasonably be expected to result in an
Alternative Proposal, including in each case the identity of the person
making any such Alternative Proposal, indication, inquiry, offer or request
and the  



 

\- 44 -  material terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal, indication,
inquiry or offer. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed on
a current basis of the status (including any material changes to the terms
thereof) of any such discussions or negotiations regarding any such
Alternative Proposal, indication, inquiry or offer or any material
developments relating thereto, (ii) provide to Parent promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all
correspondence and other written materials, including those provided by
electronic mail, sent or provided to the Company from any third party or sent
or provided by the Company to any third party that include the terms or
conditions of any such Alternative Proposal or any financing in connection
with any Alternative Proposal and (iii) if Parent shall make
a counterproposal, consider in good faith the terms of such counterproposal
(the Company agreeing that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any such
information to Parent, except to the extent that any third partys debt
financing sources shall have imposed confidentiality restrictions on the
Company with respect to the interest rates or specific pricing terms of such
debt financing). The Company shall provide or make available to Parent
(subject to the Confidentiality Agreement) any non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not previously provided to
Parent contemporaneously with providing any such information to any person
making an Alternative Proposal or its Representatives.

(f) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations
regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Alternative Proposal. The Company shall direct that all copies of all
nonpublic information it or its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives
have distributed on or prior to the date of this Agreement to other potential
purchasers be returned to the Company or destroyed (with a certification as
to such destruction by a responsible officer) as soon as possible.

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer made by any person for (i) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, tender offer, dissolution, liquidation or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) the
acquisition by any person of 15% or more of the consolidated total assets
(based on fair market value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (iii) the acquisition by any person of 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or equity securities of any Subsidiary.

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide,
unsolicited Alternative Proposal on terms that the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys nationally
recognized, independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and
taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and
this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement), to be more favorable to the Company stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that for purposes of
the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "15% or more" in the
definition of Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "all or
substantially all"; and _provided_ _further_ that no Alternative Proposal
shall be deemed a Superior Proposal if any financing required to consummate
such Alternative Proposal is not committed.

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to: (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any
applicable Law or otherwise to cause the fulfillment of all conditions to the

Transactions, and pay any fees due in connection with such applications or

half of such fees), as promptly as is reasonably practicable, and in any event
within five Business Days, with respect to applications or filings under the

\- 47 -  applications or filings under any other competition Laws, after the date

or any other Governmental Entity in connection with such applications or
filings or the Transactions; and (v) reasonably coordinate and cooperate with
each other party in the making of any applications or filings (including
furnishing any information the other party may require in order to make any
such application or filing), or obtaining any approvals, required in
connection with the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other competition
Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Parent nor Purchaser
(nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall have any obligation to (A)
propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, holding separate, license or other
disposition of any assets or businesses (including any assets or business of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries); or (B) otherwise take or commit to
take any actions that would limit the freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporations) or affiliates freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall become subject to, or
consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental
Entity to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct,
restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the
Company or any of its affiliates, unless such requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order is binding on the Company only in the event
that the Closing occurs. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform
the other of any material communication with, and proposed
understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity
regarding any such application or filing. If a party hereto intends to
participate in any meeting or conference call with any Governmental Entity in
respect to any such filings, investigations or other inquiry, then such party
shall give the other party reasonable prior notice of such meeting or
conference call and invite Representatives of the other party to participate

_however_ , that the Company and Parent shall reasonably coordinate and
cooperate in determining whether any actions, notices, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be given or obtained, or should be given or obtained,
from parties to any Company Material Contracts in connection with
consummation of the Transactions and seeking any such actions, notices,
consents, approvals or waivers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company, Parent nor Purchaser shall be required to make any material payment
to any third party or agree to any material limitation on the conduct of its
business, in order to obtain any such consent.

(c) From the date of this Agreement until the consummation of the Offer, each
of Purchaser and the Company shall promptly notify the other in writing of any
pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser or the Knowledge of the Company (as
the case may be),  



 

\- 48 -  threatened Legal Proceeding: (i) challenging or seeking material damages in
connection with the Transactions; or (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Transactions or otherwise limit in any material respect
the right of Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser to own or operate all or
any portion of the businesses or assets of the Company. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense
or settlement of any such litigation and shall consider Parents views with
respect to such litigation and shall not settle any such litigation without
the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required to provide any notice or information to Parent the
provision of which the Company in good faith determines would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the Companys or any other Persons attorney
client or other privilege with respect to such information.

(d) If any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by
a Governmental Entity challenging the Transactions as violative of
any applicable Law, each of the Company and Purchaser shall, and shall cause
their respective affiliates to, reasonably cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to contest and resist, except insofar as the Company and
Purchaser may otherwise agree, any such action or proceeding, including any
action or proceeding that seeks a temporary restraining order or preliminary
injunction that would prohibit, prevent or restrict consummation of the
Transactions.

(e) Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of Purchaser
beneficially owned by it, or sign a written consent in lieu of a meeting of
the stockholders of Purchaser, in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in

So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Parent, nor
any of their respective controlled affiliates, shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to
the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other
party, unless such party determines, after consultation with outside counsel,
that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the
listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect
to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such party shall
endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a
meaningful opportunity to the other parties to review and comment upon such
press release or other announcement and shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the party seeking to issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or
this Agreement shall not be required to provide any such review or comment to
the other party in connection with any disclosure contemplated by Section 5.2.
The Company and Parent agree to issue a joint press release announcing
this Agreement.

Section 6.5 Directors and Officers Insurance and Indemnification.

(a) Parent and Purchaser agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
now existing in favor  



 

\- 49 -  of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may
be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organization
documents or in any agreement shall, solely with respect to acts or omissions
prior to the Effective Time, survive the Transactions and shall continue in
full force and effect. For a period of six years from the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, solely
with respect to acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time, the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Companys and any Company Subsidiarys certificates of incorporation and by-
laws or similar organization documents as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder, solely with respect to acts or omissions prior
to the Effective Time, of any individuals who at the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any action
pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this Section 6.5.

 

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage with respect to matters arising at or
before the Effective Time providing coverage no less favorable to the
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than the coverage
provided by such policies on the date of this Agreement. At Parents option,
in lieu of such insurance, following the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation may purchase a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and
conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising at or before the Effective Time. If such "tail"
policy is obtained, no party shall have any further obligation to purchase or
pay for any insurance pursuant to this Section 6.5.

(c) Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing
the obligations provided in this Section 6.5

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organization
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.
The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the consummation of the
Transactions and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties.

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person it shall make proper provision so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume the respective obligations of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation set forth in this Section 6.5.



 

\- 50 - Section 6.6 State Takeover Laws.

If any "control share acquisition", "fair price" or other anti-takeover Laws
enacted under state or federal Laws becomes or is deemed to become applicable
to the Company, the Offer, the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer,
the Merger or any other Transaction, then the Company Board of Directors shall
take all action necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of such status
or regulations on the Offer, the Merger or the Transactions.

Section 6.7 Certain Tax Matters.

During the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company
shall: (i) timely (taking into account any extension of time within which to
file) file all material Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and prepare such Tax Returns in all material respects in a
manner consistent with past practice; (ii) timely pay all Taxes shown as due
on such Tax Returns, except for such Taxes contested in good faith and for
which an adequate reserve has been established in accordance with GAAP on the
appropriate financial statements; and (iii) promptly notify Parent of any
federal or state income or franchise, or other material Tax, suit claim,
action, investigation, proceeding or audit pending against or involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax matters (or any
significant developments with respect to ongoing Tax matters), including
without limitation material Tax liabilities and material refund claims.

Section 6.8 Section 16. 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take such steps as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be duly approved for purposes of Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act or exempt thereunder. Provided that the Company
shall first provide to Parent the names of its stockholders and the number of
shares of Common Stock or Company Options which may be subject to Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act and any other information reasonably requested by
Parent and relating to the same, the Board of Directors of Parent, or an
authorized committee thereof, shall, prior to the Effective Time, take
appropriate action to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act, the issuance of the Merger Consideration to holders of Company Options in
accordance with Section 2.5.

Section 6.9 Obligations of Purchaser.

Parent hereby guarantees Purchasers obligations under this Agreement
and agrees to be liable for any breach of this Agreement by Purchaser.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all Benefit Plans
and compensation  



 

\- 51 -  arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, _provided_ that nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit the amendment or termination of any such Benefit
Plans, Foreign Plans, arrangements and agreements in accordance with their
terms and applicable Law. For a period of 12 months following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current
employee and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company
Employees_ ") compensation and benefits that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the compensation and benefits provided to Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent also shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to perform the Companys obligations under the change in control
and other agreements between the Company and certain of its officers and
employees unless any such officer or employee agrees otherwise.

(b) Company Employees shall continue to participate in the Benefit Plans or
Foreign Plans following the Effective Time unless and until Parent chooses to
have some or all of the Company Employees participate in one or more New
Plans. If and to the extent Company Employees are permitted to become
participants in one or more New Plans, then for purposes of vesting, waiting
period, eligibility to participate, and level of benefits under such New
Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect
to the same period of time. To the extent permitted under the applicable New
Plan, for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and, to the extent permitted by the applicable New
Plan or otherwise practicable without adverse tax consequences, Parent shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the
Transactions ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins, and overlapping with the portion of the current
plan year of such New Plan which has elapsed prior to such participation date,
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) The Company may pay each Company Employee employed as of immediately prior
to December 29, 2007 and then participating in the Companys 2008 fiscal year
bonus plan, and any former Company Employee terminated by, or pursuant to an
agreement with, the Company or its Subsidiaries, that remains eligible to
participate in such plan to the extent permitted by the terms of such plan,
and at the earlier of the Effective Time or the times, consistent with past
practices, in which the Company would ordinarily make payment pursuant to its
2008 fiscal year bonus plan for the period ending December 29, 2007, the
Company  



 

\- 52 -  Employees bonus entitlement under all such plan as of December 29, 2007. As
of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall adjust such bonus plan and
its targets and objectives so that the bonus period will begin January 1, 2008
and end December 31, 2008. Bonus payments hereunder shall be calculated
without taking into account any expenses or costs associated with or arising
as a result of transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any non-
recurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred
had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred.

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that at the Effective Time a "change of
control" (or similar phrase) shall occur within the meaning of the Company
Stock Plans (and award agreements thereunder) and the Benefit Plans and the
Foreign Plans, as applicable, including without limitation the employee change
of control agreements.

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries will, at the request of Parent prior to
the Closing Date, take all action necessary to terminate any Benefit
Plan subject to Section 401(k) of Code prior to the Closing on terms
reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Surviving Corporation, and their
Affiliates shall not be prohibited by this Section 6.10 from treating the
employees as at-will employees (subject to any contrary employment agreements
or applicable Law), or terminating or transferring or changing the terms of
the employment of any employee, or adopting, amending, or terminating any
benefit plan or other compensatory arrangement. No provision of this Section
6.10 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or any
current or former director or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any
other matter.

Section 6.11 Standstill Agreements; Confidentiality Agreements.

During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries is a party, other than client and customer agreements entered
into by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. During such period, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement, including by
using reasonable best efforts to obtain injunctions to prevent any breaches of
such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof
in any court having jurisdiction.

FORM OF SUPPORT AGREEMENT



 

\- 71 - STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT

This STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), is dated as of December 11,
2007, by and between Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the
"Parent") and the stockholders listed on the signature pages hereto (each a
"Stockholder" and collectively, the "Stockholders").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, Parent, NAC Equipment Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Purchaser"), and Nextest Systems
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), are entering into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as it may be
amended from time to time in accordance with its terms, the "Merger
Agreement"), providing for, among other things, Purchaser to commence a cash
tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common
Stock") followed by the subsequent merger of Purchaser with and into the
Company with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
therein (capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement); and

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Stockholder is the record and beneficial
owner of the number of shares of Company Common Stock set forth, and in
the manner reflected, on _Attachment A_ hereto (the "Owned Shares"); and

WHEREAS, as a condition to Parent and Purchasers willingness to enter into
and perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement, Parent and Purchaser
have required that each Stockholder agree, and each Stockholder has agreed,
(i) to tender in the Offer (and not withdraw) all of such Stockholders Owned
Shares as well as any shares of Company Common Stock acquired by such
Stockholder after the execution of this Agreement (all of which, after so
acquired, shall constitute "Owned Shares"), whether upon the exercise of
options, conversion of convertible securities or otherwise, and any other
voting securities of the Company (whether acquired heretofore or hereafter)
that are beneficially owned by such Stockholder or over which such Stockholder
has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote (collectively, the "Voting
Shares"), and (ii) that in the event that a vote of the Companys stockholders
is required in furtherance of the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, such Stockholder will vote all of
such Stockholders Voting Shares in favor of any such proposal, and (iii) to
take the other actions described herein; and

WHEREAS, each Stockholder desires to express its support for the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, by executing this Agreement; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration given to each party hereto, the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 1\. _Agreement to Tender and Vote; Irrevocable Proxy_.

1.1 _Agreement to Tender_. Each Stockholder hereby agrees that promptly after
the commencement of the Offer, but in any event no later than 5 p.m. New York
time on the third Business Day before the initially scheduled expiration of
the Offer, such Stockholder shall tender into the Offer all of such
Stockholders Owned Shares. No Stockholder shall withdraw any of such
Stockholders Owned Shares previously tendered.

1.2 _Agreement to Vote_. Each Stockholder hereby agrees that, during the time
this Agreement is in effect, at any meeting of the stockholders of the
Company, however called, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, such
Stockholder shall be present (in person or by proxy) and vote (or cause to be
voted) all of its Voting Shares (a) in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and (b) against any Alternative Proposal and against any action or
agreement that would delay, prevent, impede or impair the ability of Parent
and Purchaser to complete the Offer or the Merger or the ability of the
Company to consummate the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.

1.3 _Irrevocable Proxy_. Solely with respect to the matters described in
Section 1.2, for so long as this Agreement has not terminated in accordance
with Section 6.1, each Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints Parent (or any
nominee of Parent) as its attorney and proxy with full power of substitution
and resubstitution, to the full extent of such Stockholders voting rights
with respect to such Stockholders Voting Shares (which proxy is irrevocable
and which appointment is coupled with an interest, including for purposes of
Section 212 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) to vote all such
Stockholders Voting Shares solely on the matters described in Section 1.2,
and in accordance therewith. Each Stockholder hereby revokes any proxies
previously granted that would otherwise conflict with the proxy contemplated
pursuant to this Section 1.3 and agrees to execute any further agreement or
form reasonably necessary or appropriate to confirm and effectuate the grant
of the proxy contained herein. Such proxy shall automatically terminate upon
the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1.

2\. _Representations and Warranties of Stockholders_. Each Stockholder hereby
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

2.1 _Due Organization_. Such Stockholder, if a corporation or other entity,
has been duly organized, is validly existing and is in good standing under
the laws of the state of its formation or organization.

2.2 _Power; Due Authorization; Binding Agreement_. Such Stockholder has full
legal capacity, power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by such Stockholder and constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of such Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be subject to the effect
of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and to general principles of equity.

  

 

A-2 2.3 _Ownership of Shares_. On the date hereof, the Owned Shares set forth
opposite such Stockholders name on _Attachment A_ hereto are owned of record
or beneficially by such Stockholder in the manner reflected thereon and
include all of the Voting Shares owned of record or beneficially by such
Stockholder, free and clear of any claims, liens, encumbrances and security
interests, except (if applicable) as set forth on _Attachment A_ hereto, which
encumbrances or other items do not affect in any respect the ability of such
Stockholder to perform such Stockholders obligations hereunder. As of the
date hereof such Stockholder has, and as of the expiration of the Offer such
Stockholder will have (except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement), sole
voting power (to the extent such securities have voting power) and sole
dispositive power with respect to all of the Owned Shares, except as otherwise
reflected on _Attachment A_.

2.4 _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such
Stockholder does not, and the performance of the terms of this Agreement by
such Stockholder will not, (a) require such Stockholder to obtain the consent
or approval of, or make any filing with or notification to, any governmental
or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign, (b) require the consent or
approval of any other person or entity pursuant to any agreement, obligation
or instrument binding on such Stockholder or its properties and assets, (c)
conflict with or violate any organizational document or law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment or decree applicable to such Stockholder or pursuant to
which any of its or its affiliates respective properties or assets are bound
or (d) violate any other agreement to which such Stockholder or any of its
affiliates is a party including, without limitation, any voting agreement,
stockholders agreement, irrevocable proxy or voting trust. The Voting Shares
are not, with respect to the voting or transfer thereof, subject to any other
agreement, including any voting agreement, stockholders agreement, irrevocable
proxy or voting trust. 

2.5 _Acknowledgment_. Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges that each
of Parent and Purchaser is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance
upon such Stockholders execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.

3\. _Representations and Warranties of Parent_. Parent hereby represents and
warrants to the Stockholders as follows:

3.1 _Power; Due Authorization; Binding Agreement_. Parent is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Parent has full corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent, and no other proceedings on
the part of Parent are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of Parent, except that enforceability may be subject to the effect
of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and to general principles of equity.



 

A-3 3.2 _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
does not, and the performance of the terms of this Agreement by Parent will
not, (a) require Parent to obtain the consent or approval of, or make any
filing with or notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority,
domestic or foreign or (b) conflict with or violate any organizational
document or law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to
Parent or pursuant to which any of its or its subsidiaries respective assets
are bound.

4\. _Certain Covenants of the Stockholders_. Each Stockholder hereby covenants
and agrees with Parent as follows:

4.1 _Restriction on Transfer, Proxies and Non-Interference_. Each Stockholder
hereby agrees, while this Agreement is in effect, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, and otherwise as is contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
the Offer, not to (a) other than as may be specifically required by a court
order, which such Stockholder shall use its reasonable best efforts to
avoid (including by offering substitute consideration or property) and
provided further that such Stockholder shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause any such Voting Shares to be transferred subject to this Agreement,
sell, transfer, pledge, encumber (except as set forth on _Attachment A_ or
due to this Agreement), assign or otherwise dispose of (including, without
limitation, by gift, merger, consolidation or reorganization), or enter into
any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to
the sale, transfer, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of,
or limitation on the voting rights of, any of the Voting Shares (any such
action, a "Transfer"), provided that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit
the exercise by such Stockholder of any options to purchase Voting Shares, (b)
grant any proxies or powers of attorney, deposit any Voting Shares into a
voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any Voting
Shares, (c) take any action that would cause any representation or warranty of
such Stockholder contained herein to become untrue or incorrect or have the
effect of preventing or disabling Stockholder from performing its
obligations under this Agreement, or (d) commit or agree to take any of the
foregoing actions. Any action taken in violation of the foregoing sentence
shall be null and void ab initio and each Stockholder agrees that any such
prohibited action may and should be enjoined. If any involuntary Transfer of
any of the Voting Shares shall occur (including, but not limited to, a sale by
a Stockholders trustee in any bankruptcy, or a sale to a purchaser at any
creditors or court sale or any sale or transfer by operation of law,
including, without limitation, by will or intestacy), the transferee (which
term, as used herein, shall include any and all transferees and subsequent
transferees of the initial transferee) shall take and hold such Voting Shares
subject to all of the restrictions, liabilities and rights under this
Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect until valid
termination of this Agreement.

4.2 _Additional Shares_. Each Stockholder hereby agrees, while this Agreement
is in effect, that any shares of Company Common Stock acquired by such
Stockholder after the date hereof shall be subject to the terms of this
Agreement as though owned by such Stockholder on the date hereof.

4.3 _No Limitations on Actions_. Each Stockholder signs this Agreement solely
in its capacity as the record and/or beneficial owner, as applicable, of the
Owned Shares; any trustee who signs this Agreement on behalf of a
Stockholder that is a trust is signing only in his fiduciary capacity and not
as an individual; this Agreement shall not limit or otherwise affect the  



 

A-4  actions of such Stockholder or any affiliate, employee or designee of such
Stockholder or any of its affiliates in any other capacity, including
such persons capacity, if any, as an officer of the Company or a member of
the board of directors of the Company; and nothing herein shall limit or
affect the Companys rights in connection with the Merger Agreement.

4.4 _No Solicitation_. Stockholder agrees, while this Agreement is in effect,
not to directly or indirectly engage in any activity which would
be prohibited pursuant to Section 5.2(a) of the Merger Agreement if engaged
in by the Company.

4.5 _Disclosure_. Each Stockholder hereby permits Parent or the Company to
publish and disclose in any proxy materials (including all documents and
schedules filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission) its identity and
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock and the terms of this Agreement.

4.6 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, at the request of Parent and
without further consideration, each Stockholder shall execute and deliver
such additional documents and take all such further action as may be necessary
or reasonably desirable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

5\. _Stop Transfer Order_. In furtherance of this Agreement, and concurrently
herewith, each Stockholder shall and hereby does authorize the Company or the
Companys counsel to notify the Companys transfer agent that there is a stop

Agreement is in effect. At the request of Parent, each Stockholder
shall cause to be provided to Parent evidence of such stop transfer order.

with its terms, (ii) the acceptance by Parent of the tender of the Owned
Shares pursuant to the Offer, and (iii) the consummation of the Merger.

6.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
with no liability on the part of any party hereto; provided, however, no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any breach
of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination; and provided, further,
that upon payment of the Termination Fee (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
Stockholder shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.3  _Non-Survival_. The representations and warranties made herein shall not
