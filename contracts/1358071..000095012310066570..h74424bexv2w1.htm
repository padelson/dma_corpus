<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;To make a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, an Indemnified Party shall

Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer

the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.
