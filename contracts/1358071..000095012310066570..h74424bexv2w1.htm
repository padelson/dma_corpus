   ##### 

  

   

designated in a written notice delivered by Sellers Representative to Buyer

 Section 4.02 _Title Defects and Identified Claims Definitions_. 

  

 (a) The term _"Title Defect,"_ as used in this Agreement, means, with respect to any given Asset other than Office Property, any encumbrance, encroachment, irregularity, defect in or objection to a Sellers ownership of such Asset (expressly excluding Permitted Encumbrances) that causes such Seller, or Buyer from and after the Closing, not to have Good and Defensible Title to such Asset. 

  

 (b) The term _"Identified Claim,"_ as used in this Agreement, means claims, demands, losses, any requirement to deliver operations of an Asset to another party, or penalties which could be reasonably expected to materially diminish the operation or value of an Asset other than any Office Property after the Closing; _provided, however_ , Identified Claims shall not include (i) Permitted Encumbrances, (ii) the costs of routine plugging and abandoning of wellbores, (iii) Title Defects or (iv) Environmental Defects. 

  

 (c) The term _"Good and Defensible Title,"_ as used in this Agreement, means, with respect to a given Asset other than Office Property, such ownership by any Seller in such Asset that, subject to and except for the Permitted Encumbrances: 

   

 (i) with respect to each Well or Well location set forth in _Exhibit B_, entitles such Seller (and Buyer, from and after the Closing) to receive not less than the percentage or decimal interest set forth in _Exhibit B_ as such Sellers _"Net Revenue Interest"_  of all Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from such Well or Well location as to the currently producing interval in each producing Well and as to the interval or zone identified in _Exhibit B_ with respect to each non-producing Well or Well location, all without reduction, suspension or termination of such interest throughout the productive life of such Well or Well location, except as specifically set forth in _Exhibit B_; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) with respect to each Well or Well location set forth in _Exhibit B_, obligates such Seller (and Buyer, from and after the Closing) to bear not greater than the percentage or decimal interest set forth in _Exhibit B_ as such Sellers _"Working Interest"_ of the costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development, drilling, equipping, testing, completing, sidetracking, working and operation of such Well or Well location as to the currently producing interval in each producing Well and as to the interval or zone identified in _Exhibit B_ with respect to each non-producing Well or Well location, all without increase throughout the productive life of such Well or Well location, except as specifically set forth in _Exhibit B_ and except to the extent any such increase is accompanied by a proportionate increase in the applicable Net Revenue Interest; 

   

 (iii) with respect to the Subject Interests and Surface Rights, is owned of record (from the appropriate records of the applicable county, parish, country and, in the case of U.S. federal leases, from the appropriate records of the applicable office in the Bureau of Land Management and, in the case of U.S. state leases, from the appropriate records of the applicable State Land Office); 

   

 (iv) with respect to each Well or Well location set forth in _Exhibit B_ located within the jurisdiction of any municipality, having the required Permits necessary to drill and operate any such Well or Well location; and 

   

 (v) is free and clear of all liens, obligations, encumbrances and defects in title. 

  

 Section 4.03 _Notice of Title Defects and Identified Claims_. 

  

 (a) If Buyer discovers any Title Defect or Identified Claim affecting any Asset, Buyer may, at its option, notify Sellers Representative prior to 6:00 p.m., local time in Midland, Texas, on October 15, 2010 (the _"Defects Deadline"_ ) of such Title Defect or Identified Claim. To be effective, such notice (a _"Defects Notice"_ ) must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received by Sellers Representative prior to the Defects Deadline, (iii) describe the Title Defect or Identified Claim, (iv) to the extent known, identify the specific Asset or Assets affected by such Title Defect or Identified Claim, and (v) include Buyers good faith estimate of the Defect Value of such Title Defect or Identified Claim. Any matters that may otherwise constitute a Title Defect or Identified Claim, but of which Sellers Representative has not been notified by Buyer in accordance with this Section 4.03(a), shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer, except to the extent any unasserted Title Defect or Identified Claim would constitute (A) a breach of Sellers special warranty of title contained in the Assignment, (B) a breach of any of Sellers representations or warranties set forth in Article V (subject to Section 15.13) or (C) a Retained Obligation. Upon the receipt by Sellers Representative of any Defects Notice from Buyer, Sellers shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure such Title Defect or Identified Claim to Buyers reasonable satisfaction at any time prior to the Closing. 

  

 (b) The value attributable to each Title Defect or Identified Claim (the _"Defect Value"_ ) that is asserted by Buyer in a Defects Notice shall be determined based upon the criteria set forth below: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) if a Title Defect is a lien upon any Asset, the Defect Value is the amount necessary to be paid to remove the lien from the affected Asset; 

   

 (ii) if a Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest attributable to any Well or Well location is less than that stated in _Exhibit B_, then the Defect Value is the product of any Allocated Value attributed to such Asset, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between the Net Revenue Interest applicable thereto set forth in _Exhibit B_ and the actual Net Revenue Interest, and the denominator of which is the applicable Net Revenue Interest set forth in _Exhibit B_; 

   

 (iii) if a Title Defect or Identified Claim represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon the affected Asset (including any increase in Working Interest for which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest) for which the economic detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the Defect Value shall be determined by Buyer taking into account the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect or Identified Claim, the legal effect of the Title Defect or Identified Claim, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect or Identified Claim over the life of the affected Asset and the Defect Values placed upon the Title Defect or Identified Claim by Buyer; 

   

 (iv) if a Title Defect or Identified Claim is not then currently in effect or does not adversely affect an Asset throughout the entire productive life of such Asset, such fact shall be taken into account in determining the Defect Value; 

   

 (v) the Defect Value of a Title Defect or Identified Claim shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another Defect Value under this Agreement; 

   

 (vi) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary the Defect Value of a Title Defect or an Identified Claim may not exceed the Allocated Value of the affected Asset; 

   

 (vii) Buyers right to assert Title Defects and Identified Claims hereunder shall not be diminished or otherwise adversely affected by any materiality qualification contained in any of Sellers representations and warranties in Article V; and 

   

 (viii) such other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a proper evaluation. 

  

 Section 4.04 _Remedies for Title Defects and Identified Claims_. 

  

 (a) With respect to each Title Defect or Identified Claim described in a Defects Notice that is not cured on or before the Closing to Buyers reasonable satisfaction, the Defect Values for such Title Defects and Identified Claims asserted by Buyer in such Defects Notice shall be included in the Aggregate Default Threshold. If Closing occurs, then, except as provided in Sections 4.06 and 4.07, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price for Title Defects or Identified Claims. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) If any Title Defect is in the nature of an unobtained consent to assignment or other restriction on assignability, the provisions of Section 4.07 shall apply. 

  

 (c) Any dispute regarding the validity of any Title Defect, Identified Claim and/or Defect Value asserted by Buyer in a Defects Notice shall be a Disagreement subject to exclusive and final resolution by a Referee in accordance with Article XIV and Sellers Representative may elect to submit such Disagreement to a Referee in accordance with Article XIV. Subject to the termination right set forth in Section 11.01(d), the Closing shall be delayed until the resolution of all such Disagreements. If Sellers Representative does not so submit any such Disagreement with respect to any Title Defect or Identified Claim or any Defect Value for any Title Defect or Identified Claim to a Referee in accordance with Article XIV within five Business Days after the delivery to Sellers Representative from Buyer of the Defects Notice asserting such Title Defect or Identified Claim or such Defect Value for such Title Defect or Identified Claim then (i) Sellers shall be deemed to have waived any rights to object to or dispute such Title Defect or Identified Claim and any such Defect Value for any such Title Defect or Identified Claim and (ii) such Defect Value shall become final and binding for all purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.05 _Warranty of Title_. The documents to be executed and delivered by each Seller to Buyer transferring title to the Assets (other than the Office Property) as required by this Agreement, including the Assignment and Bill of Sale attached as _Exhibit E_ (the  _"Assignment"_ ), shall provide for a special warranty of title, subject to Permitted Encumbrances. The documents to be executed and delivered by each Seller to Buyer transferring title to the Office Property as required by this Agreement, including (a) the Assignment and Bill of Sale attached as  _Exhibit F_ (the _"Office Assignment"_ ) and (b) the Special Warranty Deed attached as  _Exhibit G_ (the _"Office Deed"_ ), shall each provide for a special warranty of title, subject to (i) liens of the types described in clauses (b) and (c) of the definition of "Permitted Encumbrances" and (ii) easements, rights-of-way, servitudes and similar rights that individually and in the aggregate do not and will not materially interfere with the ownership, operation, development or value of the Office Property (the matters described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence, the _"Office Permitted Encumbrances"_ ). The term _"Permitted Encumbrances"_ shall mean any of the following matters to the extent the same are valid and subsisting and affect the Assets: 

  

 (a) the Leases and operating agreements set forth in _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit C_, to the extent complete executed copies of the same (with all exhibits, schedules and attachments) are included in the Records and the same do not operate to reduce the respective Net Revenue Interests of any Seller, or Buyer from and after the Effective Time, below those set forth in  _Exhibit B_ or subclause (h) of _Schedule 5.12_, increase the respective Working Interests of any Seller, or Buyer from and after the Effective Time, above those set forth in  _Exhibit B_ or subclause (h) of _Schedule 5.12_ without a corresponding increase in the subject Net Revenue Interests, delay or prevent timely drilling and development of the Subject Interests or receipt of proceeds of Hydrocarbon production therefrom, or materially interfere with, diminish or detract from the operation, development, ownership or value of the affected Asset; 

  

 (b) any unfiled materialmans, mechanics, repairmans, employees, contractors, operators liens or other similar liens or charges for liquidated amounts arising in the ordinary 

   ##### 

  

 

course of business where payment of such amounts is not delinquent, and (i)
that any Seller has agreed to retain or pay pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or (ii) for which any Seller is responsible for paying or
releasing, and which are released, at the Closing; 

   

 (c) any current period liens for taxes and assessments affecting the Assets that are not yet due or delinquent, to the extent any Seller has agreed to pay the same pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or which are to be prorated pursuant to the terms this Agreement; 

  

 (d) to the extent that the same do not and will not at any time materially interfere with the ownership, operation, development or value of the Assets, any (i) easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other rights in respect of surface operations, pipelines, grazing, hunting, lodging, canals, ditches, reservoirs or the like and (ii) easements for streets, alleys, highways, pipelines, telephone lines, power lines, railways and other similar rights-of-way on, over or in respect of property owned or leased by any Seller or over which any Seller owns rights-of-way, easements, permits or licenses; 

  

 (e) all lessors royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, carried interests, production payments, reversionary interests and other burdens on or deductions from the proceeds of production created or in existence as of the Effective Time, whether recorded or unrecorded;  _provided that_ such matters do not operate to reduce the respective Net Revenue Interests of any Seller, or Buyer from and after the Effective Time, below those set forth in _Exhibit B_ or subclause (h) of _Schedule 5.12_ or increase the respective Working Interests of any Seller, or Buyer from and after the Effective Time, above those set forth in _Exhibit B_ or subclause (h) of _Schedule 5.12_ without a corresponding increase in the subject Net Revenue Interests; 

  

 (f) preferential rights to purchase or similar agreements with respect to which (i) written waivers or consents are obtained from the appropriate parties for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) required written notices have been given for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the holders of such rights and the appropriate period for asserting such rights has expired without an exercise of such rights; 

  

 (g) required third party consents to assignments or similar agreements with respect to which written waivers or consents are obtained from the appropriate parties for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (h) all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other actions by Governmental Authorities in connection with the sale or conveyance of oil and gas leases or interests therein that are customarily obtained subsequent to such sale or conveyance; 

  

 (i) rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Authority to control or regulate any of the Assets and the applicable laws of such Governmental Authorities; 

  

 (j) Title Defects and Identified Claims which Buyer has waived or is deemed to have waived pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and 

   ##### 

  

  

 (k) liens and encumbrances which are released at Closing pursuant to Section 10.07(i). 

  

 Section 4.06 _Preferential Rights to Purchase_. Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with all preferential right to purchase provisions encumbering any Asset prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall notify Buyer of the existence of any preferential purchase rights and if any preferential purchase rights are exercised or if the requisite period has elapsed without said rights having been exercised. If a third party who has been offered an interest in any Asset pursuant to a preferential right to purchase elects prior to the Closing to purchase such Asset pursuant to the aforesaid offer, the interest so affected will be eliminated from the Assets and the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset. Otherwise, the interest offered as aforesaid shall be conveyed to Buyer at the Closing subject to any preferential right to purchase of any third party for which notice has been given but the time period for response by the holder of such preferential right extends beyond the Closing and Buyer shall assume all duties, obligations and liabilities arising from such preferential right to purchase. Without limiting the foregoing, if any such third party timely and properly elects to purchase an interest in any Asset subject to a preferential right to purchase after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be obligated to convey said interest to such third party and shall be entitled to the consideration for the sale of such interest. 

  

 Section 4.07 _Consents to Assignment_. Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents from third parties to assign the Assets to Buyer prior to Closing (other than governmental approvals that would be customarily obtained after Closing). To the extent such consents are not obtained by Sellers or Buyer prior to Closing, then such failure shall constitute a Title Defect as to that portion of the Assets affected thereby. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer, at its sole option, shall have the right to exclude any Asset which is subject to a consent to assignment that has not been obtained prior to Closing. If Buyer elects to exclude any such Asset, then the Cash Consideration shall be reduced at Closing by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Asset excluded.

Regardless as to whether or not Sellers Representative is able to obtain such a protective order or other remedy, Buyer shall be permitted to disclose such Environmental Information without any liability hereunder to the extent legally compelled.

Gray and his spouse and their respective heirs, representatives and estates, desires to Dispose of all or any part of the lands shown on  _Exhibit 7.14(b)_ within the cross-hatched outline or any improvements located thereon (the  _"Residence Property"_ ), such Disposing person (the _"Offeror"_ ) shall give written notice (the " _Offer Notice_ ") to (i) Sellers Representative, if Buyer is the Offeror or (ii) Buyer, if any Seller or affiliate of a Seller is the Offeror.

Failure to so elect and agree to the terms and conditions of the offer within such 15-day period shall be deemed a waiver by the Offeree of the preferential purchase right.

If such Disposition is not completed within the 120 day period, the proposed Disposition shall again become subject to the preferential purchase right of this Section 7.14.

 (ii) an amount equal to all costs and expenses (including rentals, royalties, production and severance taxes, capital expenditures, insurance and lease operating expenses, but excluding income taxes, franchise taxes, and similar taxes paid by or imposed on Seller that are based on net income, gross income or gross receipts) paid by Sellers that are attributable to the Assets and attributable to the period of time from and after the Effective Time; 

   

 (iii) the value of all merchantable Hydrocarbons attributable to the Wells in storage as of the Effective Time above the sales connection or upstream of the applicable sales meter, such value to be the current market price or the price paid, less taxes and gravity adjustments deducted by the purchaser of such Hydrocarbons; 

   

 (iv) an amount equal to the capital costs incurred and paid by Sellers from July 1, 2010 until Closing to drill and complete the wells set forth on _Schedule 10.02(a)(iv)_ (the _"Specified Wells"_ ); _provided that,_ for the avoidance of doubt, such capital costs include the capital costs to drill and complete to a Specified Wells initial objective depth and do not include any costs or expenses relating to sidetracking, deepening, recompleting or plugging back or any reworking, workover costs or expenses or lease operating expenses; and

 (i) an amount equal to all unpaid ad valorem, property, production, severance and similar taxes and assessments based upon or measured by the ownership and operation of the Assets that are attributable to periods of time prior to the Effective Time, which amounts shall, to the extent not actually assessed (and not otherwise accurately ascertainable), be computed based on such taxes and assessments for the preceding tax year (such amount to be prorated for the period of Sellers and Buyers ownership before and after the Effective Time); 

   

 (ii) an amount equal to all revenues collected by each Seller with respect to the Assets and attributable to Hydrocarbons produced after the Effective Time;

 (c) If an aggregate net gas imbalance relative to the Subject Interests exists as of the Effective Time based upon the information in _Schedule 5.16_ or any subsequent independent gas balancing statements (a _"Gas Imbalance"_ ), the Cash Consideration shall be increased if the Subject Interests are underproduced, or decreased if the Subject Interests are overproduced, by the product of (i) the amount (measured in thousand cubic feet _"Mcf"_ ) of such Gas Imbalance, and (ii) $4.50 per Mcf. 

  

 (d) The adjustments described in Sections 10.02(a), (b) and (c) are referred to in this Agreement as the _"Cash Consideration Adjustments_. _"_

   ##### 

  

   

from and after the Effective Time, including all drilling costs, all capital
expenditures, and all overhead charges under applicable operating or other
agreements (regardless of whether any Seller or an affiliate of any Seller
serves as operator prior to the Closing), and (ii) except as
otherwise provided in Section 10.02(b)(vi), Sellers will receive all proceeds
from sales of Hydrocarbons that are produced and saved prior to the Effective
Time and any other revenues arising out of the ownership or operation of the
Assets prior to the Effective Time, net of all applicable
production, severance, and similar taxes, and net of all costs and expenses
that are incurred in the ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the
Effective Time including all drilling costs, all capital expenditures, and
all overhead charges under applicable operating or other agreements. 

  

 (b) Not later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers Representative shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement of the estimated Cash Consideration Adjustments taking into account the foregoing principles (the _"Closing Statement"_ ). Sellers Representative shall make available to Buyer in Sellers offices all documents supporting the estimated Cash Consideration Adjustments. The Cash Consideration paid by Buyer to Sellers Representative at Closing shall be the Cash Consideration, as adjusted by the estimated Cash Consideration Adjustments set forth in the Closing Statement; _provided that_ if Buyer notifies Sellers Representative on or before the Closing Date that it disputes in good faith Sellers Representatives estimate of the Cash Consideration Adjustments, then the Cash Consideration paid at Closing shall be the amount that is midway between Sellers Representatives and Buyers estimated amounts. The Cash Consideration paid at Closing shall be subject to post-Closing adjustment in accordance with Section 10.04. 

  

 Section 10.04 _Post-Closing Adjustments to Cash Consideration_. 

  

 (a) On or before 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers Representative a revised Closing Statement setting forth the actual Cash Consideration Adjustments. To the extent reasonably required by Buyer, each Seller shall, and shall cause its officers, managers, employees, agents and representatives to, assist in the preparation of the revised Closing Statement. Buyer shall provide Sellers Representative such data and information as Sellers Representative may reasonably request supporting the amounts reflected on the revised Closing Statement in order to permit Sellers Representative to perform or cause to be performed an audit. The revised Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the 60th day following receipt thereof by Sellers Representative (the _"Final Settlement Date"_ ), unless Sellers Representative gives written notice of its disagreement (a _"Notice of Disagreement"_ ) to Buyer prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in detail the dollar amount, nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer in a timely manner and the Parties are unable to otherwise resolve the dispute evidenced by the Notice of Disagreement, then such dispute evidenced by the Notice of Disagreement shall be subject to exclusive and final resolution by a Referee in accordance with Article XIV. If Buyer fails to deliver to Sellers Representative a revised Closing Statement on or before 90 days after the Closing Date, then Sellers Representative may elect to compel Buyers delivery of a revised Closing Statement and seek the resolution of all matters related thereto by a Referee in accordance with Article XIV. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) If the amount of the Cash Consideration as set forth on the Final Statement exceeds the amount of the estimated Cash Consideration paid at the Closing, then Buyer shall pay to Sellers Representative, in immediately available funds, the amount by which the Cash Consideration as set forth on the Final Statement exceeds the amount of the estimated Cash Consideration paid at the Closing within five Business Days after the later of Final Settlement Date and the second Business Day after Sellers Representative designates, in a written notice delivered by Sellers Representative to Buyer, one or more accounts for such payment. If the amount of the Cash Consideration as set forth on the Final Statement is less than the amount of the estimated Cash Consideration paid at the Closing, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer, in immediately available funds, the amount by which the Cash Consideration as set forth on the Final Statement is less than the amount of the estimated Cash Consideration paid at the Closing (the _"Post-Closing Adjustment"_ ), within five Business Days after the later of Final Settlement Date and the second Business Day after Buyer designates, in a written notice delivered by Buyer to Sellers Representative, one or more accounts for such payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the term _"Final Statement"_ means (i) if the revised Closing Statement becomes final pursuant to Section 10.04(a), such revised Closing Statement, or (ii) upon resolution of any Disagreement regarding a Notice of Disagreement by a Referee in accordance with Article XIV, the revised Closing Statement reflecting such resolution, which the Parties shall issue following such resolution. Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable for any payment due pursuant to this Section 10.04(b). 

  

 Section 10.05 _Transfer Taxes_. The Parties do not expect that there will be any sales, use or other transfer taxes imposed with respect to the property transfers undertaken pursuant to this Agreement; however, if any such sales, use or other transfer taxes are applicable to such transfers, Buyer shall be responsible for such sales, use or other transfer taxes (other than taxes on gross income, net income or gross receipts). The Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable law, the amount of any of the foregoing taxes. 

  

 Section 10.06 _Ad Valorem and Similar Taxes_. All ad valorem, property, severance and similar taxes and assessments based upon or measured by the value of the Assets (but not income taxes, franchise taxes or similar taxes based upon net income, gross income or gross receipts) shall be divided or prorated between Sellers and Buyer as of the Effective Time. Sellers shall retain responsibility for such taxes attributable to the period of time prior to the Effective Time and Buyer shall assume responsibility for the period of time from and after the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, the following taxes shall be divided or prorated in the following manner: (a) in the case of a tax that is attributable to the severance and production of Hydrocarbons, the portion of any such tax that is attributable to the period of time prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be the amount of such taxes that would be payable with respect to the ownership and operation of the Assets as of the end of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time as if such period were treated as ending as of the day prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) in the case of a tax that is in the nature of a property or ad valorem tax, the portion of any such tax that is attributable to the period of time prior to the Effective Time shall be the amount of such tax for the entire tax period (or, in the case of such tax determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such tax for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the day 

   ##### 

  

   

immediately preceding the Effective Time and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire period. 

  

 Section 10.07 _Actions of Sellers at the Closing_. At the Closing, Sellers shall execute (where applicable) and deliver to Buyer the following:

 (B) the remedies set forth in this Section 11.02 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Sellers against Buyer and any of its former, current or future partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents or representatives for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated; 

  

 (C) except to the extent otherwise provided in this Section 11.02, the Parties agree that, if this Agreement is terminated, the Parties shall have no liability to each other under or relating to this Agreement; and

Except as otherwise provided in Article XIV, if any Party resorts to legal proceedings to enforce this Agreement, including arbitration, the prevailing Party in such proceedings shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs incurred by such Party, including reasonable attorneys fees, in addition to any other relief to which such Party may be entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 Section 12.04 _Sellers  Indemnification_. PROVIDED THAT THE CLOSING OCCURS AND SUBJECT TO SECTIONS 11.03, 12.05 AND 15.13, SELLERS SHALL JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY RELEASE, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS BUYER, ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE FORMER, CURRENT OR FUTURE, PARTNERS, MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, OWNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, THE " _BUYER INDEMNITEES_ ") FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES AS A RESULT OF, ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATED TO (A) THE RETAINED OBLIGATIONS, OR (B) ANY INACCURACY OR BREACH OF (I) ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY SELLER SET FORTH IN ARTICLE V OR (II) ANY COVENANT, OBLIGATION OR AGREEMENT OF ANY SELLER CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT THAT BY ITS TERMS IS TO BE PERFORMED AFTER THE CLOSING, IN EACH CASE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF ANY OF THE BUYER INDEMNITEES 

   ##### 

  

   

EXCLUDING ANY LOSSES AS A RESULT OF, ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATED TO ANY BUYER
INDEMNITEES GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. 

  

 Section 12.05 _Limits on Indemnification_. Subject to Section 15.13, no Seller will have any liability under Section 12.04(B) for claims for indemnification as a result of, arising out of or related to any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of any Seller set forth in Article V that survives the Closing until the Buyer Indemnitees have aggregate Losses equal to $25,000,000 arising from such types of claims for indemnification, and then the recoverable Losses under Section 12.04(B) for such types of claims for indemnification shall include the entire amount of such Losses in excess of $10,000,000; _provided that_ the foregoing limitation shall not apply to Losses arising from claims for a breach of the representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in Sections 5.01 through Section 5.06 or Section 5.31. 

  

 Section 12.06 _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows: 

  

 (a) The term _"Indemnifying Party"_ , as used in this Agreement in connection with particular Losses, means the party or parties having an obligation to indemnify another party or parties with respect to such Losses pursuant to this Agreement. The term  _"Indemnified Party"_ , as used in this Agreement in connection with particular Losses shall mean the party or parties having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Losses by another party or parties pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (b) To make a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, an Indemnified Party shall provide written notice (the _"Claim Notice"_ ) to the Indemnifying Party of its claim under this Section 12.06, specifying in such Claim Notice, in reasonable detail, the nature and basis for such claim for indemnification under this Agreement. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a third party against the Indemnified Party (a  _"Third-Party Claim"_ ), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third-Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third-Party Claim; _provided that_ the failure of an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third-Party Claim as provided in this Section 12.06 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Agreement except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third-Party Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the Third-Party Claim. 

  

 (c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its responsibility to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its responsibility to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend the Third-Party Claim, at its sole cost and expense. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third-Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 12.06. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim or (ii) settle any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity). 

  

 (e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its responsibility to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim or admits its responsibility but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Third-Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its responsibility for a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its responsibility for the Third-Party Claim and (ii) if responsibility is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement. 

  

 (f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Losses complained of, (ii) admit its responsibility for such Losses or (iii) dispute the claim for such Losses. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30 day period that it has cured the Losses or that it disputes the claim for such Losses, the amount of such Losses shall conclusively be deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. 

  

 Section 12.07 _Offset Rights and Limitations_. If any amounts are determined as owing by any Seller to any Buyer Indemnitee as a result of a claim pursuant to this Article XII and such amounts are not paid to such Buyer Indemnitee within five Business Days after the Buyer Indemnitee makes demand therefor, then Buyer may elect (but shall not be required to elect and may pursue remedies directly against the Sellers) to offset against the unpaid balance of principal and interest on the Promissory Note any such amount so owed. If Buyer chooses to offset against the Promissory Note in accordance with this Section 12.07 any amounts finally determined as owing by any Seller to a Buyer Indemnitee, Buyer shall give notice to Sellers Representative of its decision. As a condition to any assignment of the Promissory Note, any transferee of the Promissory Note (other than Buyer or its affiliates), shall be required to acknowledge and agree in writing that the Promissory Note will be subject to Buyers right of 

   ##### 

  

   

offset under this Section 12.07 in the event that amounts are owing to any
Buyer Indemnitee from any Seller as a result of a claim pursuant to this
Article XII. 

  

 Section 12.08 _Express Negligence_. THE PARTIES INTEND THAT THE INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE XII BE CONSTRUED AND APPLIED AS WRITTEN ABOVE, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY RULE OF CONSTRUCTION TO THE CONTRARY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE XII, BUT LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED THEREIN, SUCH INDEMNITIES SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY STATES "EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE" OR SIMILAR RULE THAT WOULD DENY COVERAGE BASED ON AN INDEMNITEES SOLE OR CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT, TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE XII, THE INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE XII SHALL APPLY TO AN INDEMNITEES SOLE OR CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS PROVISION IS "CONSPICUOUS" FOR PURPOSES OF ALL STATE LAWS.

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 13.02(a), in the event of any loss described in Section 13.02(a), at the Closing Sellers shall pay to Buyer all sums paid to Sellers by third parties by reason of the destruction or taking of such Assets, including any sums paid pursuant to any policy or agreement of insurance or indemnity, and shall assign, transfer and set over unto Buyer all of the rights, titles and interests of Sellers in and to any claims, causes of action, unpaid proceeds or other payments from third parties, including any policy or agreement of insurance or indemnity, arising out of such destruction or taking. 

  

ARTICLE XIV 
 DISAGREEMENT RESOLUTION 

   

 Section 14.01 _Disagreements_. 

  

 (a) _Scope; Appointment of Referee_. All disputes among the Parties regarding Title Defects, Identified Claims, Defect Values, Environmental Defects or Environmental Defect Values, or calculation of the Final Statement or revisions thereto _("Disagreements")_ shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this Article XIV. If the Parties are unable to reach resolution as to any such outstanding Disagreement within five days following delivery of a written notice from either Buyer or Sellers Representative to the other Parties that Buyer or 

   ##### 

  

   

Sellers Representative, as applicable, intends to submit such Disagreement
to the Referee for resolution pursuant to this Article XIV, then any Party
may, by written notice to the other Parties (a _"Referee Election Notice"_ ),
elect to submit such Disagreement to a single arbitrator (the " _Referee_ "),
who shall be selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Sellers
Representative within 15 days after the delivery of such Referee Election
Notice in accordance with following: 

   

 (i) in the case of any Disagreement regarding Title Defects or Defect Values, the Referee shall be a title attorney with at least 20 years experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in which the Assets with respect to which such Title Defects are alleged or with respect to which such Defect Values in dispute are located and who is licensed to practice law in the state in which such Assets are located; 

   

 (ii) in the case of any Disagreement regarding Environmental Defects or Environmental Defect Values, the Referee shall be an environmental consultant with at least 20 years experience involving properties in the regional area in which the Assets with respect to which such Environmental Defects are alleged or with respect to which such Environmental Defect Values in dispute are located; 

   

 (iii) in the case of any Disagreement regarding the calculation of the Final Statement or revisions thereto, the Referee shall be a senior partner of a independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and Sellers Representative; 

   

 (iv) in the case of any Disagreement regarding an Identified Claim, the Referee shall be a person qualified by education, experience and training to render a decision upon the matter in dispute; 

   

 (v) in the case of any Disagreement, the Referee shall not have had a substantial relationship with any Party or any affiliate of any Party during the two years prior to such selection; 

  

 _provided that,_ in any case, in the absence of such agreement within 15 days of the delivery of the Referee Election Notice, the Referee shall be selected as would a single arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the _"AAA Rules"_ ) notwithstanding the selection method and criteria set forth in clauses (i)-(v) above. 

  

 (b) _Additional Procedures_. All proceedings under this Article XIV shall be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico and shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA Rules, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Article XIV _._ The Referees final determination shall be made within 21 days after submission of the matters in dispute to the Referee, and the Referee shall agree to comply with this schedule before accepting appointment. In making its determination, the Referee shall be bound by terms of this Agreement, to the extent applicable, and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Referee are necessary to make a proper determination. The Referee, however, may not determine that a (a) Defect Value of a Title Defect or Defect Value of an Identified Claim is greater than the Defect Value claimed by Buyer in its applicable Defects Notice or (b) Environmental Defect 

   ##### 

  

   

Value is greater than the Environmental Defect Value claimed by Buyer in its
applicable Environmental Defects Notice. The Referee shall act as an expert
for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defects,
Identified Claims, Defect Values, Environmental Defects or Environmental
Defect Values, or calculation of the Final Statement or revisions thereto
submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to
any Party with respect to any matter. Each Seller and Buyer shall each bear
their own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Sellers
(collectively) and Buyer shall each bear one-half of the costs and expenses
of the Referee. 

  

 (c) _Waiver_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time Buyer may waive any Title Defect, Identified Claim, Defect Value, Environmental Defect or Environmental Defect Value previously asserted by Buyer. 

  

 (d) _Binding Nature_. The decision and award of the Referee with respect to any arbitration under this Article XIV shall be binding upon the Parties and final and nonappealable to the maximum extent permitted by law, and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction and enforced by any Party as a final judgment of such court. 

  

 (e) _Confidentiality_. Except to the extent necessary to enforce a decision and award of the Referee, to enforce other rights of the Parties hereunder, or as required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which the securities of any Party or any of its affiliates are listed or are in the process of being listed, the Referee and Parties, and their counsel, consultants and other representatives, shall maintain as confidential the fact any proceedings are ongoing, or have been completed, under this Article XIV, any decision and award of the Referee and all documents prepared and submitted by another Party, or its counsel, consultants and other agents and representatives, in connection with any proceedings under this Article XIV. 

  

ARTICLE XV

 Section 15.02 _Expenses_. Buyer shall pay all recording fees arising from the recordation of the Assignment and the other documents delivered at Closing, except that Sellers shall pay all recording fees arising from the recordation of the lien release documents delivered by Sellers at Closing. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Party shall be solely responsible for all expenses, including due diligence expenses, incurred by it in connection with this transaction, and no Party shall be entitled to any reimbursement for such expenses from any other Party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 15.03  _Document Retention_. As used in this Section 15.03, the term _"Documents"_  shall mean all files, documents, books, records and other data delivered to Buyer by Sellers pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement (other than those that Sellers have retained either the original or a copy of), including: financial and tax accounting records; land, title and division of interest files; contracts; engineering and well files; and books and records related to the operation of the Assets prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall retain and preserve the Documents for a period of no less than three years following the Closing Date (or for such longer period as may be required by law), and shall allow each Seller or and each of their respective representatives to inspect the Documents at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice during regular business hours during such time period. Each Seller shall have the right during such period to make copies of the Documents at such Sellers expense. 

  

 Section 15.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the documents to be executed pursuant to this Agreement, and the Exhibits, Schedules and Drilling Plan constitute the entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement. No supplement, amendment, alteration, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the Parties and specifically referencing this Agreement. 

  

 Section 15.05 _Waiver_. Unless it is a waiver which is deemed to have been made automatically at the expiration of a time limit under this Agreement, any waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement must be in writing executed by the waiving party and no such waiver shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. 

  

 Section 15.06 _Publicity_. Sellers shall consult with Buyer with regard to all publicity and other disclosures concerning this Agreement (including any term or condition hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby, the status of such transactions and the negotiations related thereto, and, except as required by applicable law, no Seller shall issue any publicity or press release without the prior consent of Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 Section 15.07 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Sections 12.03 and 12.04, nothing in this Agreement shall provide any benefit to any third party or entitle any third party to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, it being the intent of the Parties that this Agreement shall otherwise not be construed as a third party beneficiary contract. 

  

 Section 15.08 _Assignment_. Except for Buyers right to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more affiliates of Buyer prior to Closing (in which event Buyer shall have no further obligations under this Agreement) and except as provided in Section 15.16, no Party may assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Parties and any assignment made without such consent shall be void. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors, assigns and legal representatives.

 Section 15.09 _Jury Waiver_. EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY A JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. 

  

 Section 15.10 _Certain Remedies_. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that its breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to Buyer and that Buyer will not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the obligations of each Seller under this Agreement shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for by Buyer and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which Buyer may have under this Agreement or otherwise. 

  

 Section 15.11 _Notices_. Any notice, communication, request, instruction or other document required or permitted under this Agreement shall be given in writing and delivered in person or sent by U.S. Mail postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or overnight courier to the addresses for Sellers and Buyer set forth below or by facsimile to the facsimile numbers for Sellers and Buyer set forth below.

Any Party may, by written notice so delivered to the other Parties, change its
address for notice purposes under this Agreement. 

   

 Section 15.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and the Parties 

   ##### 

  

   

shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect their
original intent as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the
extent possible. 

  

 Section 15.13 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in Sections 5.01 through 5.31 shall terminate as of the Closing Date and shall thereafter be of no force or effect to the extent and only to the extent that such representations and warranties relate in any way to the environmental condition of the Assets or the compliance by Sellers or the Assets with Environmental Laws (in each case specifically excluding representations regarding offsite disposal of any wastes, pollutants, contaminates, hazardous material or other material or substances on, in or below any properties not included in the Assets). Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, (a) the representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in Sections 5.07 through Section 5.30 and the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in Section 6.06 shall survive the Closing for a period of 18 months, (b) the representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in Sections 5.01 through 5.06 and Section 5.31 and the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in Sections 6.01 through 6.05 shall survive until the date which is six months after the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations, (c) the covenants, obligations and agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed prior to or at the Closing shall terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the Closing, (d) the covenants, obligations and agreements contained in Sections 7.14, 7.15, 10.06, 10.09, 11.03, 12.07 and 15.17 that by their terms are to be performed after the Closing shall survive until fully discharged and (e) all other covenants, obligations and agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed after the Closing shall survive until the seventh anniversary of the Closing; _provided however_ , that any indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall not terminate with respect to any Losses as to which the Indemnified Party has provided a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with Section 12.06 before the termination of the applicable survival period described in this sentence. 

  

 Section 15.14 _Time of the Essence_. Time shall be of the essence with respect to all time periods and notice periods set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 15.15 _Counterpart Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Facsimile or scanned and emailed transmission of any signed original document or retransmission of any signed facsimile or scanned and emailed transmission will be deemed the same as delivery of an original. At the request of any Party, the Parties will confirm facsimile or scanned and emailed transmission by signing a duplicate original document. 

  

 Section 15.16 _Tax Deferred Exchange_. Sellers and Buyer agree that either or both of Sellers and Buyer may elect to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets as an exchange of like-kind property under section 1031 of the Code (an  _"Exchange"_ ). Each Party agrees to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Parties in the completion of such an Exchange including an Exchange subject to the procedures outlined in Treasury Regulation section 1.1031(k)-1 and/or Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37. Each of Sellers and Buyer shall have the right at any time prior to Closing to assign its rights under this Agreement 

   ##### 

  

   

to a qualified intermediary (as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v)) or an exchange accommodation titleholder (as
that term is defined in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37)
to effect an Exchange. In connection with any such Exchange, any
exchange accommodation title holder shall have taken all steps necessary to
own the Assets under applicable law. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
neither an assignment of a Partys rights under this Agreement nor any other
actions taken by a Party or any other person in connection with the Exchange
shall release any Party from, or modify, any of their respective liabilities
and obligations (including indemnity obligations to each other) under this
Agreement, and no Party makes any representations as to any particular tax
treatment that may be afforded to any other Party by reason of such
assignment or any other actions taken in connection with the Exchange.
Any Party electing to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets as an
Exchange shall be obligated to pay all additional costs incurred hereunder as
a result of the Exchange, and in consideration for the cooperation of the
other Parties, the Party electing Exchange treatment shall agree to pay
all costs associated with the Exchange and to indemnify and hold each other
Party, its affiliates, and their respective former, current and future
partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and
all liabilities and taxes arising out of, based upon, attributable to or
resulting from the Exchange or transactions or actions taken in connection
with the Exchange that would not have been incurred by the other Parties but
for the electing Partys Exchange election. 

  

 Section 15.17 _Sellers  Representative_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Seller hereby appoints Johnny C. Gray to serve as its exclusive representative and agent _("Sellers  Representative")_ under this Agreement for the purpose of (i) exercising and performing, on their behalf, all of such Sellers rights and duties under this Agreement, (ii) waiving or accepting obligations or conditions pursuant to Article VIII, (iii) terminating this Agreement pursuant to Article XI, (iv) giving and receiving of notices, requests and consents under this Agreement and any other agreement executed in connection with this Agreement, (v) making of adjustments to the Purchase Price, (vi) receiving of the Purchase Price and any other payments due to any Seller under this Agreement, (vii) the allocating and distributing of the Purchase Price and any other payments due to any Seller, and (viii) executing and delivering any written instructions to the Buyer regarding the payment of the Termination Payment in accordance with this Agreement. Buyer may act, and shall be fully protected in acting, in reliance upon any and all acts and things done and performed by or agreements made by Sellers Representative with respect to the foregoing described matters on behalf of any Seller as fully and effectively as though each had done, performed, made or executed the same. Each Seller shall jointly and severally indemnify Buyer for claims arising out of or related to Buyers reliance pursuant to this Section 15.17. 

  

 Section 15.18 _Interpretation_. This Agreement shall be deemed and considered for all purposes to have been jointly prepared by the Parties, and shall not be construed against any one Party (nor shall any inference or presumption be made) on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular provision of this Agreement, who supplied the form of Agreement, or any other event of the negotiation, drafting or execution of this Agreement.
