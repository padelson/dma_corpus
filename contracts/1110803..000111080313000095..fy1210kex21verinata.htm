of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Vested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (II) with respect to each share
of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Vested Company Option,
when, as and if any of the following become payable pursuant to the terms of

(B) a Partially In-the-Money Vested Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time: (I) to have such
Partially In-the-Money Vested Company Option converted into a number of shares

Share Estimated Fair Market Value over (y) the exercise price per share of
such



Partially In-the-Money Vested Company Option divided by (2) the Per Share
Estimated Fair Market Value and (II) to receive, with respect to each such
share of Company Common Stock (of the number of shares calculated pursuant to
clause (I)), the consideration to be received in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i) when, as and if paid in
accordance with this Agreement; and

The Company agrees that the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Options) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required (including obtaining
any required consents) to effect the transactions described in this Section
2.1(d)(i) as of the Effective Time.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Unvested Company Option
shall cease to represent a right to acquire Company Common Stock, shall be
converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Buyer common
stock, and Buyer shall assume each such option subject to this Section
2.1(d)(ii). At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option shall continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the
applicable Company Stock Plan and the agreement evidencing the grant thereof
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including provisions with respect to
vesting, except that: (i) such option will be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of Buyer common stock equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issuable upon exercise of such Unvested Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio; and (ii) the per
share exercise price of each such Unvested Company Option shall be adjusted by
dividing (x) the per share exercise price of each such Unvested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, and
rounding up to the nearest cent. The terms of each Unvested Company Option
shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as
appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, or
other similar transaction with respect to Buyer common stock after the
Effective Time. The Company agrees that the Board of Directors of the Company
(or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Options) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required
(including obtaining any required consents) to effect the transactions
described in this Section 2.1(d)(ii) as of the Effective Time.

(iii) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Underwater Company Option
shall terminate and be cancelled without any consideration being payable in
respect thereof.

(e) Treatment of Company Warrants.

(i) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of
Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, each outstanding Company Warrant shall
terminate and be cancelled, and the holder thereof shall not be entitled to
receive any consideration other than cash consideration (if any). For the
avoidance of doubt, no Company Warrants shall be assumed by Buyer pursuant to
the Merger.



(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect that at the Effective Time, and without any
further action on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub, holders of outstanding
Company Warrants that were not exercised (or deemed to automatically be
exercised on a Net Basis) prior to the Effective Time shall receive no
consideration in respect of such Company Warrants pursuant to this Agreement.

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause, at the Effective Time, and without any further
action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, each holder of:

(A) an outstanding Company Common Stock Warrant (other than an Underwater
Company Warrant) (I) to have such Company Common Stock Warrant converted into
a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the
excess of (x) the Per Share Estimated Fair Market Value over (y) the exercise
price per share of such Company Common Stock Warrant divided by (2) the Per
Share Estimated Fair Market Value and (II) to receive, with respect to each
such share of Company Common Stock (of the number of shares calculated
pursuant to clause (I)), the consideration to be received in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i) when, as and if
paid in accordance with this Agreement;

(B) an outstanding Series A Warrant (other than an Underwater Company Warrant)
(I) to have such Series A Warrant converted into a number of shares of Company
Series A Preferred Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the excess of (x) the
product of the Per Share Estimated Fair Market Value and 6.641 over (y) the
exercise price per share of such Series A Warrant divided by (2) the product
of the Per Share Estimated Fair Market Value and 6.641 and (II) to receive,
with respect to each such share of Company Series A Preferred Stock (of the
number of shares calculated pursuant to clause (I)), the consideration to be
received in respect of each share of Company Series A Preferred Stock pursuant
to Section 2.1(c)(ii) when, as and if paid in accordance with this Agreement;

(C) (I) an outstanding Series B Warrant whose exercise price is less than or
equal to the Series B Per Share Closing Amount, to receive, with respect to
each share of Company Series B Preferred Stock subject to such Series B
Warrant, the consideration to be received in respect of each share of Company
Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(iii) when, as and if paid
in accordance with this Agreement minus, with respect to the payment to be
made promptly following the Effective Time, the per share exercise price of
such Series B Warrant (for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to each such
share of Company Series B Preferred Stock) and (II) an outstanding Series B
Warrant (other than an Underwater Company Warrant) whose exercise price per
share is greater than the Series B Per Share Closing Amount (xx) to have such
Series B Warrant converted into a number of shares of Company Series B
Preferred Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the excess of (x) the product of
the Per Share Estimated Fair



Market Value and 7.87 over (y) the exercise price per share of such Series B
Warrant divided by (2) the product of the Per Share Estimated Fair Market
Value and 7.87 and (yy) to receive, with respect to each such share of Company
Series B Preferred Stock (of the number of shares calculated pursuant to
clause (xx)), the consideration to be received in respect of each share of
Company Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(iii) when, as and
if paid in accordance with this Agreement; and

(D) (I) an outstanding Series C Warrant whose exercise price is less than or
equal to the Series C Per Share Closing Amount, to receive, with respect to
each share of Company Series C Preferred Stock subject to such Series C
Warrant, the consideration to be received in respect of each share of Company
Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(iv) when, as and if paid
in accordance with this Agreement minus, with respect to the payment to be
made promptly following the Effective Time, the per share exercise price of
such Series C Warrant (for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to each such
share of Company Series C Preferred Stock) and (II) an outstanding Series C
Warrant (other than an Underwater Company Warrant) whose exercise price per
share is greater than the Series C Per Share Closing Amount (xx) to have such
Series C Warrant converted into a number of shares of Company Series C
Preferred Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the excess of (x) the Per Share
Estimated Fair Market Value over (y) the exercise price per share of such
Series C Warrant divided by (2) the Per Share Estimated Fair Market Value and
(yy) to receive, with respect to each such share of Company Series C Preferred
Stock (of the number of shares calculated pursuant to clause (xx)), the
consideration to be received in respect of each share of Company Series C
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(iv) when, as and if paid in
accordance with this Agreement.

(f) At the Effective Time, the holder of each then outstanding Underwater
Company Warrant shall not be entitled to any consideration in respect thereof.

(g) In calculating the consideration payable under this Article II, Buyer
shall be entitled to rely on the representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.22 and the Closing Date Allocation Schedule. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, in no event shall Buyer be required to fund an amount in excess of
(i) the sum of (w) the Final Closing Cash Consideration, (x) the Type 1
Milestone Payment if achieved, (y) the Type 2 Milestone Payment if achieved
and (z) the Financial Metric Milestone Payments to the extent achieved reduced
by (ii) any indemnity amount set off against any Milestone Payment in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(h) An illustrative schedule of the allocation of the Merger consideration, at
Closing and upon the payment of the Milestone Payments, is attached as
Schedule 2.1(h). Such schedule is attached for illustrative purposes only and
makes various simplifying assumptions, including the maximum achievement of
all Milestone Events and the absence of any indemnification claims.



2.2 Payment Fund . The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Company
Stock for the consideration to be paid to the holders of such Company Stock in
connection with the Merger are as follows:

(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit the
Payment Fund with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Company
Equityholders (other than Dissenting Shares) in accordance with this Section
2.2.

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business
Days) after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a Share Certificate or Book Entry (i) a letter of
transmittal in substance and form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer ("Letter of
Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Share
Certificates and shares of Company Stock represented by Book Entries in
exchange for the applicable consideration payable with respect thereto;
provided, that Buyer shall assist the Company in developing arrangements for
the delivery of such materials to the Principal Equityholders to facilitate
the payment of the consideration specified in Sections 2.1(c) immediately
following the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Share Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or shares of Company Stock represented by a
Book Entry, in either case, together with a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, the holder of such Share Certificate or shares of Company Stock
represented by such Book Entry shall be paid the consideration specified in
Section 2.1(c), as applicable, in exchange therefor. In the case of any shares
of Company Stock represented by a Share Certificate, if any consideration in
respect of shares of Company Stock is to be paid under this Section 2.2 to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Share Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such exchange
that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Surviving
Corporation any Transfer Taxes or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of such consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Share Certificate so surrendered, or such Person shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Share Certificate and each share of Company Stock represented by a
Book Entry shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount and type of
consideration into which such shares of Company Stock have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any
such amounts.

(c) Allocation Schedules. The "Initial Allocation Schedule" attached hereto as
Exhibit D sets forth, as of the date hereof, the following information with
respect to each Company Equityholder: (i) the name and the mailing address of
such Company Equityholder as reflected on the stock transfer or other
corporate records of the Company; (ii) (A) with respect to each Share
Certificate representing shares of Company Stock or Book Entry Shares held by
such Company Equityholder, (x) the number and class or series of Company
Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock, Company Series B Preferred
Stock, Company Series C Preferred Stock, Company Series C-1 Preferred Stock
and Company Series D Preferred Stock represented by such Share Certificate or
applicable Book Entry and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
into which such Company Preferred Stock is convertible, (B) with



respect to each Company Option held by such Company Equityholder, the number
of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Option and the per share
exercise price thereof, (C) with respect to each Company Common Stock Warrant
held by such Company Equityholder, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company Common Stock Warrants and the per share exercise
price thereof, (D) with respect to each Company Preferred Stock Warrant held
by such Company Equityholder, (x) the number of shares and type of Company
Preferred Stock underlying such Company Preferred Stock Warrants and the per
share exercise price thereof and (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock into which such shares of Company Preferred Stock would be convertible;
and (E) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Company Equityholder, assuming the conversion of the Company Preferred Stock,
the exercise of the Company Options, the exercise of the Company Common Stock
Warrants, and the exercise and subsequent conversion to Company Common Stock
of the Company Preferred Stock Warrants, in each case, held by such Company
Equityholder, (iii) the Number of Fully Diluted Shares, the Number of Fully
Diluted Vested Shares and the Number of Fully Diluted Unvested Shares. The
Company shall deliver to Buyer and the Paying Agent, at least three (3)
Business Days prior to Closing, an update to the Initial Allocation Schedule
(as so updated, the "Closing Date Allocation Schedule"), which (I) shall
contain, in addition to the information described in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) the previous sentence, the consideration due to each such Company
Equityholder pursuant to Sections 2.1(c), 2.1(d) and 2.1(e) at Closing, on the
Escrow Release Date (assuming the full disbursement of the Escrow Amount),
upon the payment of the maximum amount (as applicable) of each Milestone
Payment and upon the distribution of the Stockholder Representative Amount
Surplus (assuming such amount equals the Stockholder Representative Expense
Amount), in each case, assuming the payment of such amounts to the Paying
Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (II) shall be
consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. All Merger consideration
paid or payable upon the surrender for exchange of Share Certificates or Book
Entries evidencing shares of Company Stock (including, in each case, any
Milestone Payments payable with respect thereto) in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Stock. From and after the Effective Time
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Stock which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or Book Entry
representing any such shares of Company Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except, in the case of any such shares of Company Stock
other than Dissenting Shares, for the right to receive the amount and type of
consideration as set forth in this Article II.

(e) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Stock for six (6) months after the
Effective Time and any earnings on the Payment Fund shall be delivered to
Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), upon demand,
and any holder of Company Stock who has not



previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall look only to Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Law)
for the consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II.

(f) No Liability. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, their
Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers, employees or agents shall
be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(g) Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation (and its payroll agent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to the
Company Equityholders such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld by the Paying Agent, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
(or its payroll agent), as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be (i)
remitted by the Paying Agent, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) deducted and treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Company
Equityholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Paying Agent, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

(h) Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes, arising out of, or in connection with,
the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne equally by
Buyer on the one hand, and the Company Equityholders, on the other hand. The
party required to file any Tax Return related to Transfer Taxes shall file
such Tax Return and pay any Transfer Taxes and the other party or parties
shall reimburse the paying party for its share of Transfer Taxes within ten
(10) days of written request. Buyer shall have the right to claim from the
Escrow Fund any Transfer Taxes to be borne by the Company Equityholders.

(i) Lost Certificates. If any Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, and if requested by Buyer, the
delivery of an indemnification agreement or bond in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, of that fact by the Person claiming such Share
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate the applicable
consideration specified in Section 2.1 with respect to the shares of Company
Stock evidenced by such Share Certificates.

2.3 Closing Estimates; Payments and Deliveries at Closing .

(c) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Preliminary
Closing Statement"), certified on behalf of the Company by the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company, setting forth in reasonable detail the Company's good
faith estimates of: (i) the Closing Cash (such estimate, the "Estimated
Closing Cash"), (ii) the Company Transaction Expenses (such estimate, the
"Estimated Company Transaction Expenses") and (iii) the Closing Indebtedness
(such estimate,



the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"). If Buyer reasonably objects to the
estimates provided by the Company, the amount in dispute is in excess of
$500,000 and Buyer provides supporting detail for such objection, then fifty
percent (50%) of the disputed amount in excess of $500,000 shall be deposited
with the Escrow Agent to be held in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and
shall be distributed within two (2) Business Days following the Determination
Date in a manner consistent with Section 2.5 of this Agreement.

(d) At the Closing, Buyer shall:

(i) deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Payment
Agent the Payment Fund in accordance with Section 2.2(a) and the Paying Agent
Agreement;

(ii) deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Escrow
Agent an amount in cash equal to the Escrow Amount in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement;

(iii) pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, the Stockholder
Representative Expense Amount to the Stockholder Representative Fund, to the
account designated by the Stockholder Representative in writing to Buyer no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to be held and
disbursed in accordance with Section 2.7;

(iv) pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, on behalf of the Company,
to the account or accounts designated by the Pay-Off Letters obtained in
accordance with Section 6.10, an amount in the aggregate equal to the Closing
Indebtedness as set forth in the Preliminary Closing Statement; and

(v) pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, on behalf of the Company,
an amount in the aggregate equal to the Estimated Company Transaction
Expenses, as set forth in the Preliminary Closing Statement.

(e) All payments to be made from the Payment Fund (i) pursuant to Section 2.2
to the former holders of Company Stock for which a Share Certificate has been
properly surrendered or Book Entry Stock properly surrendered (in each case,
other than Dissenting Shares) and (ii) pursuant to Section 2.8(a) to the
holders of the Company Preferred Stock Warrants shall be made by the Payment
Agent by check, or at the option and expense of the applicable holder in the
case of any payment of $500,000 or more, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account set forth in the applicable Letter of
Transmittal promptly following the proper surrender thereof to the Payment
Agent.

2.4 Closing Adjustment Amount .

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a statement (the
"Final Closing Statement") setting forth Buyer's determination of (i) the
Closing Cash, (ii) the Company



Transaction Expenses and (iii) the Closing Indebtedness, in each case, along
with supporting detail to evidence the calculations of such amounts.

(b) After the delivery of the Final Closing Statement, at the Stockholder
Representative's request, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, including their respective Representatives, to reasonably assist
the Stockholders Representative in its review of the Final Closing Statement
and shall provide to the Stockholder Representative and its Representatives
reasonable access to such information relating to the Final Closing Statement
they may reasonably request for such purpose.

(c) Unless the Stockholder Representative notifies Buyer in writing within 30
days after Buyer's delivery of the Final Closing Statement of any objection to
Buyer's calculations of the Closing Cash, the Company Transaction Expenses or
the Closing Indebtedness (such written notice, a "Notice of Objection"), the
Final Closing Statement shall be final and binding for all purposes hereunder
(it being understood that an objection to one or more of the foregoing amounts
shall not prevent any other amount from becoming final and binding for all
purposes hereunder). Any Notice of Objection shall specify in reasonable
detail the basis for the objections set forth therein and shall include the
Stockholder Representative's calculation of any amounts that are disputed by
such Notice of Objection (the "Disputed Amounts") to the extent that such
amounts may be determined. If the Stockholder Representative provides such
Notice of Objection to Buyer within such 30-day period, Buyer and the
Stockholder Representative shall, during the 30-day period following the
Stockholder Representative's delivery of such Notice of Objection to Buyer,
attempt in good faith to resolve any Disputed Amounts. If Buyer and the
Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve all such Disputed Amounts
within such period, the matters remaining in dispute shall be submitted to a
nationally recognized public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Buyer and
the Stockholder Representative (such accounting firm being referred to herein
as the "Independent Accountant"). Buyer and the Stockholder Representative
shall instruct the Independent Accountant to render its decision within sixty
(60) days of its selection. The Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder
Representative shall each furnish to the Independent Accountant such work
papers and other documents and information relating to the Disputed Amounts as
the Independent Accountant may request. The resolution of the Disputed Amounts
by the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding, and the
determination of the Independent Accountant shall constitute an arbitral award
that is final, binding and unappealable and upon which a judgment may be
entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover.

(d) The date on which the Company Transaction Expenses, the Closing
Indebtedness and the Closing Cash are finally determined in accordance with
Section 2.4(c) is hereinafter referred as to the "Determination Date." Buyer
and the Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Company
Equityholders and in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative, not in
its individual capacity) shall each pay their own costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the resolution of the Disputed Amounts; provided, that the
fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated between
Buyer and the Stockholder Representative in the same proportion that the total
amount of the Disputed Amounts submitted to the Independent Accountant that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally



determined by the Independent Accountant) bears to the total amount of the
Disputed Amounts so submitted by each such party.

(e) Within two (2) Business Days following the Determination Date, (i) if the
Final Closing Cash Consideration exceeds the Estimated Closing Cash
Consideration (the amount of such excess, the "Closing Adjustment Amount,"
which amount, if less than $25,000, shall be deemed to be zero), then Buyer
shall pay to the Paying Agent for distribution to the former holders of
Company Stock, Vested Company Options and Company Warrants, the portion of the
Closing Adjustment Amount to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1(c), 2.1(d) or 2.1(e), respectively, and (ii) if the Estimated
Closing Cash Consideration exceeds the Final Closing Cash Consideration (the
amount of such excess, the "Downward Closing Adjustment Amount," which amount,
if less than $25,000, shall be deemed to be zero), then Buyer shall be
entitled to receive promptly a payment in cash out of the Escrow Fund in an
amount equal to the Downward Closing Adjustment Amount.

2.5 Release of Escrow Amount .

(a) On the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the
"Escrow Release Date"), the Escrow Fund shall be disbursed in accordance with
this Section 2.5 and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) The amount necessary to satisfy any claim pending and set forth in a claim
for indemnification as of the Escrow Release Date shall be retained by the
Escrow Agent and held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement until the resolution of
such claim (any such retained amount, a "Holdback Amount") and the balance of
the Escrow Fund (less any amount that the Stockholder Representative may
determine in its sole discretion should be held in the Escrow Fund in order to
pay any expenses that may be incurred by the Stockholder Representative in
connection with the resolution of any such claim pending as of the Escrow
Release Date or otherwise in connection with its acting as the Stockholder
Representative) shall be paid to the Paying Agent for distribution to the
Company Equityholders promptly following the Escrow Release Date in accordance
with Section 2.5(c). Promptly following the resolution of any claim in respect
of which a Holdback Amount was retained in the Escrow Fund, the portion
thereof that is not disbursed to Buyer as a result of the resolution of such
claim or disbursed to the Stockholder Representative or continued to be
retained in the Escrow Fund in respect of the Stockholder Representative's
expenses pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be distributed to Company
Equityholders promptly following such resolution in accordance with Section
2.5(c).

(c) Any amounts released from the Escrow Fund for distribution to the Company
Equityholders (other than in respect of Stockholder Representative's expenses)
at any time (including on the Escrow Release Date), and from time to time,
pursuant to Section 2.5 are referred to, individually and collectively, as the
"Unused Escrow Payment." The Escrow Agent shall pay the Unused Escrow Payment
to the Paying Agent for distribution to the former holders of Company Stock,
Vested Company Options and Company Warrants, the portion of the Unused Escrow
Payment to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), 2.1(d)
or 2.1(e), respectively.



2.6 Dissenting Shares .

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the
California Corporations Code (the "CCC"), as applicable, to a holder of
Dissenting Shares.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect statutory appraisal rights or otherwise), then, as of the later of
the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall
automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive
the applicable consideration specified in Section 2.1 with respect to such
shares, without interest thereon, upon proper surrender of the Share
Certificate or Book Entry representing such shares, as applicable, in the
manner specified in Section 6.2.

(c) The Company shall give Buyer: (i) prompt written notice of any written
demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL or CCC, any notice of withdrawal of any such demand and
any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL or CCC that relate to such demand and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make
any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to
any such demand, notice or instrument unless Buyer shall have given its
written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

2.7 Stockholder Representative .

(a) By their approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement and/or
their acceptance of any consideration pursuant to this Agreement, each Company
Equityholder individually appoints the Stockholder Representative as its
representative, attorney-in-fact and agent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In connection therewith, the Stockholder
Representative is authorized to do or refrain from doing all further acts and
things, and to execute all such documents as the Stockholder Representative
shall deem necessary or appropriate, and shall have the power and authority
to:

(i) act for the Company Equityholders with regard to all matters relating to
this Agreement and any Ancillary Document (including the Escrow Agreement);

(ii) act for the Company Equityholders in connection with any dispute or
litigation involving this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;

(iii) execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
certificates and documents that the Stockholder Representative deems necessary
or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;



(iv) facilitate the disbursement of funds to the Company Equityholders and,
with respect to the Stockholder Representative Fund, receive funds, make
payments of funds, and give receipts for funds;

(v) do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the Company
Equityholders that the Stockholder Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in its discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
as fully and completely as the Company Equityholders could do if personally
present;

(vi) give and receive all notices required to be given or received by the
Company Equityholders under this Agreement; and

(vii) receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement.

(b) All decisions and actions by the Stockholder Representative shall be
binding upon all Company Equityholders, and no Company Equityholder shall have
the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

(c) At the Effective Time, Buyer shall pay the Stockholder Representative
Expense Amount to the Stockholder Representative, which Stockholder
Representative Expense Amount shall be maintained by the Stockholder
Representative in a segregated account. The Stockholder Representative shall
be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the
performance of its duties (including the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) under this Agreement from the Stockholder Representative Fund and, if
such fund is insufficient to pay such expenses, from the first proceeds from
Milestone Payments otherwise available for distribution to the Company
Equityholders. Upon the determination of the Stockholder Representative that
the Stockholder Representative Fund is no longer necessary in connection with
any dispute regarding Milestone Payments, the remaining amount, if any, in the
Stockholder Representative Fund (the "Stockholder Representative Account
Surplus") shall be paid to the Paying Agent for distribution to the former
holders of Company Stock, Vested Company Options and Company Warrants the
portion of the Stockholder Representative Account Surplus to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), 2.1(d) or 2.1(e),
respectively. The Company Equityholders will not receive any interest or
earnings on the Stockholder Representative Fund and irrevocably transfer and
assign to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Stockholder
Representative Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Stockholder Representative Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose and shall not be available to Buyer to satisfy any claims
hereunder.

(d) The Stockholder Representative shall act for the Company Equityholders on
all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Stockholder
Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Company
Equityholders. The Stockholder Representative is authorized to act on behalf
of the Company Equityholders notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among
the Company Equityholders. In taking any actions as



Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative may rely
conclusively, without any further inquiry or investigation, upon any
certification or confirmation, oral or written, given by any Person the
Stockholder Representative reasonably believes to be authorized thereunto. The
Stockholder Representative may, in all questions arising hereunder, rely on
the advice of counsel, and the Stockholder Representative shall not be liable
to any of the parties hereto or to any Company Equityholder for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Stockholder Representative based on
such advice. The Stockholder Representative undertakes to perform such duties
and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the
Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative shall not have any
liability to any of the parties hereto or the Company Equityholders for any
act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in
good faith. The Stockholder Representative shall be indemnified by the Company
Equityholders from and against any loss, liability or expense and arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties
hereunder, in each case as such loss, liability or expense is suffered or
incurred; provided, that in the event that any such loss, liability or expense
is finally adjudicated to have been primarily caused by the bad faith of the
Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the
Company Equityholders the amount of such indemnified loss, liability or
expense attributable to such bad faith. Any such claim for indemnification
shall be satisfied first from the Stockholder Representative Fund and, if such
fund is insufficient to satisfy any such loss, liability or expense, from the
first proceeds from Milestone Payments otherwise available for distribution to
the Company Equityholders or by a claim against the Company Equityholders
(with each Company Equityholder liable for its pro rata share of any such
claim, calculated on the basis of the share of any Stockholder Representative
Account Surplus to which such Company Equityholder would be entitled).

(e) The Company and Buyer shall provide the Stockholder Representative with
(i) reasonable access to relevant information of the Company and Buyer and
(ii) reasonable assistance from the Company's and Buyer's employees for
purposes of evaluating the information provided, and performing its duties and
exercising its rights, pursuant to Section 2.7(d); provided, that the
Stockholder Representative shall treat confidentially and not disclose any
nonpublic information from or about the Company to anyone except (i) in
connection with any disputes arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or (ii) where reasonably determined by the Stockholder
Representative to be necessary or appropriate for the performance of the
Stockholder Representative's functions pursuant to this Agreement, to
individuals that agree to treat such information confidentially.

(f) In the event the Stockholder Representative becomes unable to perform its
responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the Company
Equityholders (acting by a written instrument signed by the Required
Stockholders) shall select another representative to fill the vacancy of the
Stockholder Representative, and such substituted representative shall be
deemed to be the Stockholder Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement. The Stockholder Representative may only be removed upon delivery of
written notice to Buyer signed by the Required Stockholders.



(g) For all purposes of this Agreement:

(i) Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Stockholder Representative as to the settlement of any
disputes or claims under this Agreement or any other actions required or
permitted to be taken by the Stockholder Representative hereunder, and no
party hereunder shall have any cause of action against Buyer for any action
taken by Buyer in reliance upon the instructions, decisions of or actions of
the Stockholder Representative;

(ii) the provisions of this Section 2.7 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company Equityholder may have
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iii) the provisions of this Section 2.7 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and
successors of each Company Equityholder, and any references in this Agreement
to a Company Equityholder shall mean and include the successors to the rights
of each applicable Company Equityholder hereunder, whether pursuant to
testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

2.8 Treatment of Company Options and Company Warrants .

(a) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement and
subject to Buyer's approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld, the
Company shall mail to each holder of a Company Option a letter describing the
treatment of such Company Option, pursuant to Section 2.1(d). As promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time), Buyer shall pay to each holder of In-
the-Money Vested Company Options the applicable consideration described in
Section 2.1(d)(i)(A)(I). Buyer shall pay to each former holder of In-the-Money
Vested Company Options each additional payment of the consideration described
in Section 2.1(d)(i)(A)(II) concurrently with the payment of such
consideration to the former holders of Company Stock. Buyer shall make
payments to each former holder of Partially In-the-Money Vested Company
Options in accordance with Section 2.1(d)(i)(B).

(b) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement and
subject to Buyer's approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld, the
Company shall mail to each holder of a Company Warrant a letter describing the
treatment of such Company Warrant, pursuant to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. As promptly as practicable (but in no event
later than five (5) Business Days) following the Effective Time, Buyer shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay to each holder of a Company Warrant the
applicable consideration described in Section 2.1(e)(iii), with respect to
payments to be made in connection with the Closing for the applicable series
of Company Preferred Stock. Buyer shall pay to each former holder of Company
Warrants each additional payment of the consideration described in Section
2.1(e)(iii) concurrently with the payment of such consideration to the former
holders of Company Preferred Stock.

the Stockholder Representative of the achievement by or on behalf of Buyer or
its Affiliates of each of the "Milestone Events" set forth in Schedule 2.9(a)

the Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, 35 U.S.C. §200 et seq., and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as any foreign equivalents

interests in and to all Company Intellectual Property and to maintain,
protect, and preserve the security, confidentiality, value and ownership of
all non-public Company Intellectual Property, including by implementing

for the Company that assigns to the Company, or otherwise includes provisions
sufficient to ensure that the Company becomes the exclusive owner of, any and
all Intellectual Property created or developed by such employees within the

other than an employee, from the services such Person performs for the
Company, (ii) caused all employees and other Persons with access to any of the
non-public Company Intellectual Property to execute a binding confidentiality
agreement that includes customary confidentiality and restricted use terms,

impermissible use of any other non-public Company Intellectual Property by any
Person who has not executed a confidentiality agreement. Copies of the forms
of agreements referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) have been made
available to Buyer prior to the date hereof, and to the Knowledge of the
Company, no material breach of any such agreement by the other party thereto
has occurred or been threatened.

(j) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or the performance by the Company of its or
their obligations hereunder, conflict or will conflict with, alter or impair,
any of the Company\'s rights in or to any Company Intellectual Property or the
validity, enforceability, use, right to use, ownership, priority, duration,
scope or effectiveness of any such Company Intellectual Property or otherwise
trigger any additional payment obligations with respect to any Company
Intellectual Property.

have not been used for any research and development or validation work
subsequent to the MELISSA trial and have been stored properly to allow future
use. The Company has not been informed by the FDA and has no reason to believe
that a retrospective study utilizing the MELISSA cohort is inconsistent with a
PMA IVD application.

parties, and use, and, in the case of Buyer, cause its Subsidiaries to use,
their reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents required in
connection with the Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed
in the Company Disclosure Letter or (iii) required to prevent the occurrence
of an event that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect prior to or after the
Effective Time.

(u) For the avoidance of doubt, any information provided by the Company
pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(v) If any information otherwise required to be furnished by any party hereto
pursuant to this Section 6.5 (such party, the "Furnishing Party") constitutes
information (i) relating to trade secrets, (ii) that is commercially sensitive
or (iii) the provision of which would violate any Law or the terms of any
Contract or would cause any applicable attorney-client privilege to be lost,
the Furnishing Party shall advise the applicable other party that such
information is not being furnished, and the Furnishing Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts (A) to obtain the required consent of any
third party to provide such access or



disclosure or (B) to develop an alternative to providing such information so
as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the
Company.

6.6 Public Disclosure . Except as may be required by Law, without the consent
of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) the Company shall
not issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement (including
announcements to the employees of the Company) with respect to the Merger or
this Agreement.

6.7 Notification of Certain Matters . During the Pre-Closing Period, Buyer
shall give prompt written notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt written notice to Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event, which occurrence or failure to occur would cause or constitute, or
be reasonably expected to cause or constitute, a breach of any representation
or warranty in the Agreement that would reasonably be expected to cause the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.3(a), as the case may
be, not to be satisfied or (b) any failure of Buyer and Merger Sub or the
Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement,
which failure would cause or constitute, or be reasonably expected to cause or
constitute, a breach of any covenant or obligation in the Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to cause the conditions to Closing set forth in Section
7.2(b) or 7.3(b), as the case may be, not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the
above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 will not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice or the conditions to such party's obligation to consummate the
Merger. Failure of the Company to comply with this Section 6.7 shall not give
rise to a remedy for the Company's failure to comply with this Section 6.7,
unless such failure was willful and intentional.

6.8 Employee Matters . Following the Closing, Buyer shall comply, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to comply, with the obligations of the Company
under each employment agreement with each employee of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date and will give each Continuing Employee
full credit for prior service with the Company (and its predecessors) for
purposes of (i) eligibility under any Buyer Employee Plans and (ii)
determination of benefit levels under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy
relating to vacation or paid time off, in each case for which the Continuing
Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered
participation, but not where such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, any
limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent
such limitations are waived or do not apply under any comparable plan of the
Company and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket
limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit Buyer from
amending or terminating any benefit plan or arrangement covering any
Continuing Employee on or after the Closing Date. Nothing in this Agreement
will prohibit Buyer from terminating a Continuing Employee at any time and
this Agreement shall not guarantee employment for a Continuing Employee for
any period of time.



6.9 280G Matters . To the extent any payments made with respect to, or which
arise as a result of, this Agreement, could be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, the
Company shall (i) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than
thirty (30) days) following the date of this Agreement, disclose its
calculations with respect to the excess parachute payments to Buyer, along
with the assumptions used to make the calculations and the data necessary for
Buyer to confirm the accuracy of the calculations, and (ii) to the extent not
already obtained, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of the recipient of any such payment that would otherwise be due and
owing that such payment shall not be due and owing, paid or retained, absent
280G Stockholder Approval (as defined below). Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall submit to a stockholder vote the right of any "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) listed in Section 6.9
of the Company Disclosure Letter to receive any and all payments (or other
benefits) contingent on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to
the extent necessary and in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, so
that, if such vote is adopted by the Company stockholders in a manner that
satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, no payment received by such
"disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)
of the Code (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code)
("280G Stockholder Approval"). Such vote shall establish the "disqualified
individual's" right to receive or retain the payment or other compensation. In
addition, the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to Company
stockholders entitled to vote under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of all material
facts concerning all payments that, but for such vote, could be deemed
"parachute payments" to any such "disqualified individual" under Section 280G
of the Code in a manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and Buyer shall have the right to
review and approve any disclosure so required before such disclosure is made,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

6.10 Pay-Off Letters . The Company shall obtain, no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, payoff letters (the "Pay-Off
Letters") in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer from the holders (or the
agents for such holders) of the Closing Indebtedness set forth in the
Preliminary Closing Statement, and all documents related thereto, including
any credit agreements, pledge agreements, security agreements, notes and
guarantees, and all Liens securing such Indebtedness, shall be released or
terminated upon the repayment of the Closing Indebtedness set forth in the
Preliminary Closing Statement in accordance with the terms of such Pay-Off
Letters.

6.11 Company Option and Company Warrant Notices . The Company shall give
notice to the holders of Company Options and the Company Warrants of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and treatment the Company Options
and the Company Warrants, in each case, in accordance with the terms thereof.

6.12 Payment of Estimated Company Transaction Expenses . On the Closing Date,
Buyer shall pay, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, all
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses in the amounts set forth on the
invoices delivered by the Company to Buyer not less than two (2) Business Days
prior to Closing, as contemplated by Section 2.3(b)



(v).

6.13 FIRPTA Certificate . Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver or
cause to be delivered, to Buyer a certification that the shares of Company
Stock are not United States real property interests as defined in Section
897(c) of the Code, together with a notice to the IRS, in accordance with the
Treasury Regulations under Section 897 and 1445 of the Code. If the Company
has not provided such certification and notice to Buyer on or before the
Closing Date, Buyer shall be permitted to withhold from the payments to be
made pursuant to this Agreement any required withholding Tax under Section
1445 of the Code.

6.14 Termination of Contracts with Company Related Persons . The Company shall
take all actions necessary so that, at or prior to the Effective Time, each
Contract or arrangement between the Company and a Company Related Person set
forth in Section 6.14 of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be terminated
without further liability to or obligation of the Company.

6.15 Tax Matters .

Returns that relate to a Tax period that ends on or before the Closing Date
but is filed after the Closing Date in accordance with past practice of the
Company.

(b) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer, the Company and the Stockholder
Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other parties, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns,
the filing of any amended Tax Return for a period prior to (or including) the
Closing Date, any Tax audits, Tax proceedings or other Tax- related claims.

6.16 DandO Indemnity and Insurance .

(a) The certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of former officers and directors that provide the officers and
directors of the Company prior to the Closing with rights that that are no
less favorable than the rights afforded to such individuals in the Company's
certificate of incorporation and by-laws immediately prior the Effective Time.
For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit the Surviving Corporation to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation or by-
laws relating to the exculpation or indemnification of former officers and
directors (unless required by applicable law) in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective
Time, were officers or directors of the Company, unless such amendment,
modification or repeal is required by applicable law after the Effective Time,
it being the intent of the parties hereto that the officers and directors of
the Company prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law. For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time,
Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification
agreements in effect as of the date hereof between the Company and the



Company's former officers and directors with respect to acts and omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing, subject to applicable law. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing this Section 6.16 shall prevent the Surviving
Corporation from combining with any other entity (including Buyer), or the
taking of any other action by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation that may
result in the amendment, repeal or modification of the Surviving Corporation's
certificate of incorporation or by-laws, or any provision thereof relating to
the exculpation or indemnification of former officers and directors, as long
as Buyer causes the Surviving Corporation to provide the officers and
directors of the Company prior to the Closing with rights that in the good
faith judgment of Buyer are no less favorable than the rights afforded to such
individuals in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation or by-
laws.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase and fully pay for, at its
expense a six-year "tail" insurance policy with respect to directors' and
officers' liability insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time.

(c) This Section 6.16 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the former directors and officers of the Company and their
heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving
Corporation and its successors and assigns. In the event the Surviving
Corporation or its successor or assign (a) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (b) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of the Surviving
Corporation shall honor the obligations set forth with respect to the
surviving corporation and Buyer in this Section 6.16.

6.17 Form S-8; NASDAQ Listing . Buyer shall file a Registration Statement on
Form S-8 with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the shares of
Buyer common stock issuable with respect to Unvested Company Options as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement thereafter for so long as any of such Unvested Company Options
remain outstanding. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the shares of Buyer common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of
Unvested Company Options to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective
Time.

6.18 Certain Actions. Prior the Effective Time, the Company (a) shall take all
action necessary to terminate the employment of the individual set forth in
Section 6.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with the terms of
such individual's employment agreement and to provide that the Company has no
obligations with respect to such individual following the Effective Time and
(b) shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such individual to release the
Buyer Indemnified Parties (including the Company) from all liability with
respect to such termination.

there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer, the Company,
Merger Sub or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or

extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance,
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any



agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified

"Maximum Liability Cap").

For purposes of determining whether the Threshold, the Indemnification Cap,
the De Minimis Amount or the Maximum Liability Cap has been reached, all of

(y) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, in addition to any other right
hereunder:

(i) Buyer and its Affiliates shall have the right, but not the obligation,
from time to time to set off any Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification hereunder against any Milestone
Payment; provided, that such right of set off with respect to indemnification
claims made under Section 9.2(a)(i) (except in the event of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful and material breach and with respect to the
Specified Representations, as to which this proviso shall not apply) shall in
no event exceed $15,000,000, and may only be set off after the Escrow Fund has
been reduced to zero or if the Buyer Indemnified Parties have pending
indemnification claims against the Escrow Fund equal to or in excess of the
remaining balance thereof.

(ii) If at the time any Milestone Payment is due and payable there shall be
any outstanding claim for indemnification (subject to the proviso set forth in
Section 9.2(c)



(i)), the amount of Losses with respect to which shall not have been finally
determined, then the amount of such Milestone Payment shall be reduced by the
amount of Losses the Buyer Indemnified Party reasonably estimates to be
subject to such indemnification claim. If the final amount of Losses for such
indemnification claim is less than the amount by which such Milestone Payment
was reduced for such claim, then Buyer shall promptly deliver the difference
to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Company Equityholders pro rata (on
the basis of each Company Equityholder's proportionate share of the applicable
Milestone Payments such Company Equityholders would have received but for the
set off of such amount). If the final amount of Losses for such
indemnification claim exceeds the amount by which such Milestone Payment was
reduced for such claim, then, subject to Section 9.2(b), Buyer shall continue
to be entitled to indemnification for the amount of such excess pursuant to
the terms and conditions of this Article IX.

(z) If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the rights to
indemnification set forth in this Article IX shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted by or on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties or
any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, whether before or after the date of this Agreement, with respect to
the inaccuracy or noncompliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation which is the subject of indemnification hereunder.

(aa) The amount of Losses recoverable by any Buyer Indemnified Party under
this Article IX with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by (i) the
amount of any payment actually received by such Buyer Indemnified Party from
any insurance policy net of any deductibles or other amounts payable with
respect thereto and (ii) the amount of any net Tax benefits realized by the
Buyer Indemnified Party from the incurrence or payment of such Losses. For
purposes of Section 9.2(e)(ii), a Tax benefit will be considered realized by a
Buyer Indemnified Party at the time of the receipt of a Tax refund (or credit
in lieu of a Tax refund) or upon the actual reduction in Tax paid by such
Buyer Indemnified Party or the actual use by such Buyer Indemnified Party of a
Tax overpayment as a credit or other Tax offset (and, in the case of such a
reduction, credit, offset or use, only at the time the Tax so reduced,
credited or offset would otherwise have been due and payable); provided, that
in determining whether a specified Tax benefit is realized and the amount
thereof, the Buyer Indemnified Party receiving a Tax benefit shall be
considered to utilize all tax benefits, losses, deductions, offsets, credits,
and other Tax attributes, other than Tax items associated with the Loss at
issue, prior to utilization of such Tax items.

(bb) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
related to or arising from (i) the value, condition or diminution of any net
operating loss carry forward, tax credit carry forward or any other Tax
attribute of the Company, or (ii) the ability of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to utilize any such Tax asset, shall constitute Losses under this
Article IX.

(cc) Except to the extent damages in connection with a Third Party Claim are
awarded to a third party, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled
to recover pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this Article IX any
punitive or exemplary damages.



(dd) Each of the parties agrees to treat any indemnification payment made
pursuant to this Article IX as an adjustment to the Final Closing Cash
Consideration for all income tax purposes.

9.3 Procedures for Third Party Claims.

days following receipt of written notice of such Third Party Claim) notify the
Stockholder Representative in writing of such Third Party Claim (such notice,
a "Third Party Claim Notice"), describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such Third Party Claim;
provided, that the failure to promptly provide such notice shall not waive any
rights of the Buyer Indemnified Party under this Article IX except to the
extent the rights of the Company Equityholders are actually and materially
prejudiced thereby (it being understood that the failure to have released the
remainder of the Escrow Fund at the end of its expected period due to an
inability to ascertain the amount of Loss owed to a Buyer Indemnified Party at
such time shall not constitute such prejudice).

(f) The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to assume control of
the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Buyer Indemnified Party; provided, that (i) the Stockholder Representative
may only assume control of such defense on behalf of the Company Equityholders
if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Buyer Indemnified Parties on behalf
of all of the Company Equityholders that any damages, fines, costs or other
liabilities that may be assessed against the Buyer Indemnified Party in
connection with such Third Party Claim constitute Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article IX and (B)
the damages claimed or sought in such Third Party Claim, taken together with
the reasonably estimated costs of defense thereof and the claimed amount with
respect to any unresolved claims for indemnification then pending, is less
than or equal to the current balance held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow
Agreement, and (ii) the Stockholder Representative may not assume control of
the defense of any Third Party Claim (X) involving any allegation of criminal
liability or misappropriation or infringement of any Intellectual Property,
(Y) in which equitable relief is sought against the Buyer Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates or (Z) involving any allegation by any Governmental
Entity of non-compliance with applicable Law. Prior to the time the Buyer
Indemnified Party is notified by the Stockholder Representative as to whether
the Stockholder Representative will assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to timely preserve the
collective rights of the parties with respect to such Third Party Claim,
including responding timely to legal process. In the event the Stockholder
Representative has assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance
herewith, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in
the defense thereof (it being understood that the Stockholder Representative
shall control such defense) and to employ its own counsel, all at its own
expense. If the Stockholder Representative shall decline to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim (or shall fail to notify the Buyer Indemnified Party
of its election to defend such Third Party



Claim) within thirty (30) days after the giving by the Buyer Indemnified Party
to the Stockholder Representative of a Third Party Claim Notice with respect
to such Third Party Claim, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall control the
defense against such Third Party Claim. The Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to be reimbursed for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the
Buyer Indemnified Party in the defense of such Third Party Claim (including
all such reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Party
prior to the assumption of such Third Party Claim by the Stockholder
Representative in accordance with this Section 9.3(b)), including the
reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel employed by the Buyer
Indemnified Party, if and to the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to indemnification for such Third Party Claim, and subject to the
applicable limitations of Section 9.2(b). Regardless of which party assumes
the defense of such Third Party Claim, if the Stockholder Representative, on
behalf of all of the Company Equityholders, has acknowledged in writing
responsibility for such claim, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third
Party Claim without the Stockholder Representative's prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(g) The Stockholder Representative shall not consent to a settlement of, or
the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Claim without the
Buyer Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement or
judgment (A) relates solely to monetary damages for which the Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification in full and sufficient funds
remain in the Escrow Fund to fund any related payments and (B) includes as an
unconditional term thereof the release of the Buyer Indemnified Party from all
liability with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(h) Regardless of which party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
parties agree to cooperate with one another in connection therewith. Such
cooperation shall include providing records and information that are relevant
to the Third Party Claim, and making employees and officers available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder and to act as a witness or respond to legal
process.

9.4 Exclusive Remedy. Except in the case of fraud or with respect to seeking
injunctive relief pursuant to Section 11.9, from and after the Closing, the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any Buyer Indemnified Party for Losses
or other monetary damages arising from a breach of this Agreement shall be the
indemnification provided under this Article IX.

subject matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality Agreement shall

be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree to use
reasonable efforts to attempt to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid
or unenforceable term.

11.6 Counterparts and Signature . This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or .pdf transmission.

Agreement; (d) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply

meaning or interpretation of this Agreement; (f) definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such

Eastern Time, on the day prior to the date of this Agreement, or (ii)
delivered to Buyer or its counsel. The language used in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their
mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
party hereto.

11.8 Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

11.9 Remedies . Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one (1) remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and each party to
this Agreement hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the
other parties to this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law and to
interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction
or specific performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any
requirement to post any bond in connection with obtaining such relief. The
equitable remedies described in this Section 11.9 shall be in addition to, and
not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in equity that the parties to
this Agreement may elect to pursue.

11.10 Submission to Jurisdiction . Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court

Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)

and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from

out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the



maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of any other party with respect
thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and
in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 11.1. Nothing in
this Section 11.10, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

11.11 Company Disclosure Letter . The Company Disclosure Letter shall be
arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered sections contained in
Article III, and the disclosure in any section of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall qualify (a) the corresponding Section in Article III and (b) the
other Sections in Article III, in each case, to the extent that it is readily
apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it qualifies or applies to the
representations and warranties contained in such Sections. The inclusion of
any information in the Company Disclosure Letter, or in any update thereto,
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself,
that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is
material, has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the ordinary course of
business.

11.12 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
