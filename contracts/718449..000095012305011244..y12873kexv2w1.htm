Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known on a timely basis
to the Company&#146;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within
those entities; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the
Company&#146;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in the Company&#146;s periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. The
Company&#146;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on
their most recent evaluation, to the Company&#146;s auditors and the audit committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company (i)&nbsp;all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material

reporting and (ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Company&#146;s internal controls over financial reporting. For

have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
