ARTICLE III 
 MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR 
 CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER 

   

 Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective stockholders: 

   

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock_. Each Company Share owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. Each Company Share, if any, held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall not be affected by the Merger and shall remain outstanding. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each issued and outstanding Company Share (other than any Company Share to be canceled or to remain outstanding in accordance with Section 3.1(b) of this Agreement and any Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $35.00, without interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Company Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company Shares (a " _Company Certificate_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Company Certificate. 

   

 (d) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Company Shares, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide to the holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

   

 (e) _Dissenting Company Shares_. Company Shares that have not been voted for adoption of this Agreement and with respect to which appraisal shall have been properly demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at or after the Effective Time unless and until the holder of such shares withdraws such holders demand for appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or becomes ineligible for such appraisal, but rather, the holder of the Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with   ##### 

  

  

  

Section 262 of the DGCL. If a holder of Dissenting Shares shall withdraw (in
accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) the demand for such appraisal or
shall become ineligible for such appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or
the occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, each of such holders
Dissenting Shares shall cease to be a Dissenting Share and shall be
converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of Company Shares and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not make any payments with respect to, or
compromise or settle any demand for, appraisal without the prior written
consent of Parent. 

   

 Section 3.2 _Exchange of Company Certificates_. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for exchange and payment in accordance with this Article III, an amount in cash sufficient to deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for the Company Certificates (the " _Fund_ "). 

   

 (b) No later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Certificates (other than Company Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) that has not previously surrendered his, her or its Company Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Company Certificates to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (which instructions shall provide that at the election of the surrendering holder, Company Certificates may be surrendered, and the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery). Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal properly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the Company Shares previously represented by such Company Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1 and any Company Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall promptly accept such Company Certificate upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest shall accrue on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Company Certificate for the benefit of, or be paid to, the holders of Company Certificates. 

   

 (c) All Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender of Company Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Company Shares theretofore represented by such Company Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this   ##### 

  

  

  

Section 3.2, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration into which Company Shares theretofore represented by
such Company Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Article
III. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the
surrender of any Company Certificate. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. 

   

 (e) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond or other surety in such amount as the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made with respect to such Company Certificate and subject to such other reasonable conditions as the Paying Agent may impose, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such Company Certificate the Merger Consideration into which Company Shares theretofore represented by such Company Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Article III. 

   

 (f) If any payment under this Article III is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of Company Certificate surrendered or such Person shall establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

   

 (g) The Paying Agent shall invest any funds held by it for purposes of this Section 3.2 as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Fund in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of the cash required to fully satisfy such payment obligations. 

   

 (h) Parent, the Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to the holders of Company Shares such amounts, if any, as are required to be deducted or withheld under any provision of U.S. federal tax Law, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. Amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of Company Shares in respect of which such deduction or   ##### 

  

  

  

withholding was made. Nothing contained herein shall require that Parent or
any Affiliate thereof make any additional payment to holders of Company
Shares as a result of such withholding or deduction. 

   

 (i) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the cash that has been made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 3.2 that remains unclaimed by the holder of any Company Certificate six (6) months after the Effective Time, shall be returned to Parent and any such holder who has not exchanged such holders Company Certificate prior to such time shall thereafter look only to Parent for any claim for Merger Consideration hereunder. 

   

 Section 3.3 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations, or otherwise, to take, and they will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is consistent with this Agreement. 

   

 Section 3.4 _Company Stock Options_. Upon the Effective Time, each then-outstanding option to purchase Company Shares (a " _Company Option_ "), whether or not vested, granted under the Companys equity compensation plans (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, Parent (or, at Parents option, Merger Sub) shall pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option as soon as practicable following the Effective Time a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration per Company Share over the exercise price per Company Share and (ii) the number of Company Shares covered by the Company Option, subject to applicable income and employment withholding Taxes; _provided_ that if the exercise price per Company Share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration per Company Share, such Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. All restricted stock grants of Company Shares shall vest immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall take all reasonable actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.4, including obtaining the consent of the optionholders to the cancellation of their respective Company Options in accordance with this Section 3.4; _provided_ that the Company may not provide any consideration to any optionholder to obtain their consent other than as provided in this Section 3.4.

Each of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct (without giving effect to any exception or qualification contained therein relating to materiality or a Parent Material Adverse Effect) in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made as of such time (except for those representations and warranties which address matters only as of a particular date which shall have been true and correct as of such date). 

   

 (b) _Performance_. Parent and Merger Sub shall have complied, in all material respects, with all agreements, obligations, covenants and conditions required by this Agreement to be complied with by it on or prior to the Closing Date.

 (ii) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by March 31, 2006 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the Termination Date; or 

   

 (iii) if there shall be (x) any Law or (y) an Order, decree or ruling issued or any other action taken by a Governmental Entity or court of competent jurisdiction permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such Order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable.

 (ii) if prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (A) the Companys Board of Directors has received a Superior Proposal, (B) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such action is required to comply with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (C) the Company has complied with Sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 and (D) at the time of such termination, Parent has received the fee set forth in Section 8.4;  _provided_ that the Companys Board of Directors shall only be able to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) after five (5) Business Days following Parents receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Companys Board of Directors is prepared to do so, and only if, during such five (5) Business Day period, the Company and its advisors will have negotiated in good faith with Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the parties to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) by Parent: 

    

 (i) if the Company (A) shall have breached any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement (including the covenants and agreements contained in Section 6.2 or 6.3(a)) to be complied with by the Company such that the closing condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) would not be satisfied or (B) there exists a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement such that the closing condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) would not be satisfied, and, in the case of both (A) and (B), such breach is incapable of being cured by the Termination Date or is not cured by the Company within twenty (20) Business Days after the Company receives written notice of such breach from Parent or Merger Sub; or 

   

 (ii) if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (A) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, (B) the Company shall have failed to include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company that its stockholders vote in favor of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, (C) the Board of Directors of the Company fails publicly to reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) days after Parent requests in writing that such recommendation or determination be reaffirmed, (D) a tender or exchange offer relating to any Company Shares will have been commenced and the Company will not have sent to its security holders, within ten (10) days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, a statement disclosing that the Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer or (E) a Takeover Proposal is publicly announced, and the Company fails to issue, within ten (10) days after such Takeover Proposal is announced, a press release that reaffirms the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company that its stockholders vote in favor of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, in the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective officers or directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any material breach of this Agreement; and  _provided_ _further_ that the provisions of this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 (Fees and Expenses), Section 8.4 (Termination Fee) and Article IX of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement and subject to Section 8.4(b), all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees, costs and expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that each of Parent and the Company shall bear and pay one-half of   ##### 

  

  

  

the costs and expenses incurred in connection with (i) the filing, printing
and mailing of the Proxy Statement (including any SEC filing fees) and (ii)
the filing of premerger notification and report forms under the HSR Act
(including filing fees). 

   

 Section 8.4 _Termination Fee_. 

   

 (a) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to: 

    

 (i) Section 8.1(b)(i), 8.1(b)(ii), 8.1(d)(i) or 8.1(d)(ii)(B) through (E) and (x) at any time after the date hereof and before such termination a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the Companys Board of Directors and (y) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with any third party with respect to a Takeover Proposal or any such transaction involving a Takeover Proposal is consummated; or 

   

 (ii) Section 8.1(c)(ii) or 8.1(d)(ii)(A) hereof, 

 

then the Company shall (1) in the case of termination pursuant to clause (i)
of this Section 8.4(a), upon the earlier to occur of the execution of such
definitive agreement and such consummation, (2) in the case of termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii)(A), not later than the close of business on
the Business Day following such termination or (3) in the case of
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), on the date of termination, pay
Parent a non-refundable fee in an amount equal to twenty nine million dollars
($29,000,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ "), payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing to the
Company by Parent. For purposes of this paragraph (a), "Takeover Proposal"
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Article I, except that all
references to "10%" shall be changed to "50%". 

   

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i), the Company shall reimburse Parent for all its fees and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Company Expense Reimbursement Amount_ ") up to a maximum amount of five million dollars ($5,000,000), which reimbursement shall be made in cash not later than the close of business on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the later of (i) such termination and (ii) Parents delivery to the Company of reasonable back-up documentation related to such fees and expenses. If, following receipt by Parent of a Company Expense Reimbursement Amount, the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to Section 8.4(a)(i), the Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to the Termination Fee less the Company Expense Reimbursement Amount actually paid by the Company to Parent. 

   

 (c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement where a Termination Fee or the Company Expense Reimbursement Amount is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to Sections 8.4(a) and (b) are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages which may be incurred and constitute   ##### 

  

  

  

liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these agreements,
Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails
to promptly pay the Termination Fee or the Company Expense Reimbursement
Amount, and, in order to obtain such payment Parent commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee or the
Company Expense Reimbursement Amount, the Company shall pay to Parent its
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee at a rate equal
to the prime rate announced from time to time by JP Morgan Chase Bank plus 3%
per annum. 

   

 Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may by action taken by its Board of Directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party.

Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof shall be brought and determined in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby and waives the defense of sovereign immunity, (b) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or otherwise, (c) expressly waives any defense that such action is brought in an inconvenient forum and (d) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby in any court other than any Delaware state court or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware.

be given by the issuing party to the other party, and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, the issuing party will consult with the other party
prior to such issuance). The parties agree that the initial press release or
releases to be issues with respect to the transactions contemplated by this

 Section 9.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are unique and that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that, in addition to all other remedies to which it may be entitled, each of the parties to this Agreement is entitled to a decree of specific performance.

If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 

   

 Section 9.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after the Company Stockholder Approval, but after any such Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires the further approval of the holders of the outstanding Company Shares without obtaining such further approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

   

 Section 9.13 _Waivers_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of   ##### 

  

  

  

compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement and will not operate or be construed as a waiver
of any prior or subsequent breach, whether of a similar or dissimilar
nature.
