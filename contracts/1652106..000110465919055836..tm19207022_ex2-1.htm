AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 22, 2019 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and among Centreville Bank, a Rhode Island-chartered non-
member savings bank (" _Buyer_ "), PB Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation
(" _Seller_ "), and Putnam Bank, a Connecticut-chartered savings bank and
wholly owned subsidiary of Seller (" _Seller Bank_").

  



  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of Buyer and the Boards of Directors of Seller
and Seller Bank unanimously have determined that it is in the best interests
of their respective institutions, constituencies, communities and
shareholders, as the case may be, to consummate the strategic business
combination and related transactions provided for herein, pursuant to which
(i) Buyer will form a Maryland corporation (" _Merger Sub_ ") as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Buyer, and (ii) Merger Sub will merge with and into Seller
(the " _Merger_ "), with Seller as the surviving entity in the Merger;

  



  

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the Board of Trustees of Buyer and the
Boards of Directors of Seller and Seller Bank have approved this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement, each
executive officer and director of Seller has simultaneously herewith entered
into a voting agreement with Buyer substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ (each, a " _Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which
each such executive officer and director, solely in his or her capacity as a
shareholder of Seller, has agreed to, among other things, vote the shares of
Seller common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Seller Common Stock_
"), held by such executive officer or director in favor of the approval of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the strategic business combination and related
transactions provided for herein and to prescribe certain conditions thereto.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

   

1

 



    



  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER

  



  

1.1 _The Merger; Transfer and Assumption of Bank Assets and
Liabilities_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in accordance with the General Laws of Rhode Island and the Maryland General
Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
merge with and into Seller pursuant to this Agreement. Seller shall survive
and continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Maryland
(Seller, as the surviving entity in the Merger, being sometimes referred to
herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). Upon consummation of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate. It is the
intent of Buyer that (i) immediately after the Effective Time, Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause Seller Bank to transfer all of Seller Bank's
assets to Buyer, and Buyer shall assume at that time all of Seller Bank's
liabilities, including all of Seller Bank's deposits and any contingent
liability (collectively, the " _Bank Combination_ "), and (ii) immediately
after the Bank Combination, Buyer shall cause each of Seller Bank and the
Surviving Corporation to dissolve and their respective corporate existence
shall cease (collectively, the " _Dissolution_ " and, together with the
Merger and the Bank Combination, the " _Transactions_ "). Commencing upon the
Effective Time and continuing for at least two (2) years after the Closing
Date, Buyer will, subject to regulatory approval, brand Seller Bank's
existing branch offices in Seller Bank's current market area as "Putnam
Bank, a Division of Centreville Bank" or use a substantially similar name
that Buyer in its sole discretion shall determine; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that any branch offices established by Buyer after the Effective Date in
Seller Bank's current market area may be branded as "Centreville Bank",
"Putnam Bank, a Division of Centreville Bank" or a substantially similar name
that Buyer in its sole discretion shall determine.

  



  

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place by electronic exchange of documents at 10:00
a.m., Eastern time, on a date which shall be no later than five (5) business
days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of all of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII _ hereof (other than those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or
place is agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

  



  

1.3 _Effective Time_. On or (if agreed by Buyer and Seller) prior
to the Closing Date, Merger Sub and Seller shall cause to be filed
articles of merger with the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and
Taxation (the " _SDAT_ ") (collectively, the  " _Articles of Merger_ "). The
Merger shall become effective at such time as specified in the Articles of
Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MGCL, or at such
other time as shall be provided by applicable law (such time hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
MGCL.

  



  

1.5 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Articles of
Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance
with applicable law. The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable
law.

  



  

1.6 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be all of the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each of whom shall serve in
accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

1.7 _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be all of the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE II 
 MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

  



  

2.1 _Conversion of Seller Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Seller,
Seller Bank or the holder of any securities of Seller:

  



  

(a) Each share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Exception Shares
and Suspense Shares (each as defined below)), shall become and be converted
into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, the right to receive $15.25, without interest, in cash (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

  



  

(b) Each share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by Seller as
treasury stock or held by Seller, any Subsidiary of Seller or Buyer (in each
case other than shares of Seller Common Stock held in any employee benefit
plans or related trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like
or otherwise held in any fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted) and each Suspense Share remitted to Seller prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of repayment of the ESOP Loan as contemplated by
_Section 6.21_ (collectively, the " _Exception Shares_ "), shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no Merger
Consideration shall be paid or provided with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Seller Common Stock under Seller's 2017 Equity Incentive Plan and 2005 Stock-
Based Incentive Plan (collectively, the " _Seller Stock Plan_ ") that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Seller Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof and without
regard to any future vesting date thereof, automatically be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount determined by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such
Seller Stock Option, by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of such Seller Stock
Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that there
shall be withheld from such cash payment any applicable taxes required to be
withheld by applicable law with respect to such payment. The payment of the
Option Consideration shall be made by Seller or Seller Bank immediately
prior to the Effective Time, subject to Buyer's approval of the payment
amounts. Seller and Seller Bank will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Option Consideration such amounts required under the Code, or any
applicable provision of U.S. federal, state or local law. For the avoidance
of doubt, any Seller Stock Option that has an exercise price per share that is
greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(d) At the Effective Time, any vesting restrictions on each
outstanding restricted stock award under the Seller Stock Plan shall
automatically lapse and shall be treated as issued and outstanding shares of
Seller Common Stock for the purposes of this Agreement, including but not
limited to, the provisions of this _Section 2.1_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that there shall be withheld from such cash payment any applicable taxes
required to be withheld by applicable law with respect to such payment.

  



  

(e) All of the shares of Seller Common Stock converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a "
_Certificate_ ," it being understood that any reference herein to
"Certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Seller Common
Stock) previously representing any such shares of Seller Common Stock shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive, for each such share, the
Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, holders of shares shall cease to
be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of Seller, other than the right
to receive the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(f) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
a share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

2.2   _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) Not less than one (1) business day prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank,
trust company, transfer agent and registrar or other similar entity selected
by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to Seller (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for
the benefit of the holders of Certificates, an aggregate amount of cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable under _Section
2.1(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to from and after the
Effective Time as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to make all such payments, Buyer shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in
an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of funds required to
make such payments. No shareholder of Seller will have any right or interest
in the Exchange Fund unless and until the Effective Time occurs and the
shareholder satisfies the requirements of this _Section 2.2_.

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, but
in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, and provided that
Seller has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Paying Agent all
information which is necessary for the Paying Agent to perform its
obligations as specified herein, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Certificates, a form of letter of transmittal and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by
such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_ of this Agreement. The letter of transmittal shall be
prepared by Buyer, which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of
Seller, prior to the Effective Time and which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent. Upon proper
surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to
the Paying Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, a check
representing that amount of cash to which such former holder of shares shall
have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the Certificate
or Certificates surrendered pursuant to this Agreement, and the Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid
or accrued on any cash constituting the Merger Consideration.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(c) The stock transfer books of Seller shall be closed
immediately upon the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of Seller of any
shares of Seller Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to Buyer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.2_.

  



  

(d) The Paying Agent or Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be
obligated to deliver cash to which a holder of Shares would otherwise be
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the
Certificate or Certificates representing the Shares for exchange as provided
in this _Section 2.2_ , or an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity
agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be required in each case by the
Paying Agent or Buyer.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the shareholders of Seller for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time (as well as any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall
be delivered by the Paying Agent to Buyer. Any shareholder of Seller who has
not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.2_ shall thereafter look only to
Buyer for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each Certificate
or Certificates representing the shares such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest being paid or
accrued on any cash constituting the Merger Consideration. If any outstanding
Certificate or Certificates for one or more shares is not surrendered or the
payment of the Merger Consideration attributable to such Seller Common Stock
is not claimed prior to the date on which such cash would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed
Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property,
escheat and any other applicable law, become the property of Buyer (and to the
extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither
the Paying Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any
holder of Shares represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws. Buyer and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the
share transfer books of Seller to establish the identity of those Persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement,
which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a
dispute with respect to ownership of any Shares represented by any
Certificate, Buyer and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deposit any
Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third
party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

(f) Buyer (through the Paying Agent, if applicable) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amount as Buyer is
required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amount so deducted
and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Buyer.

  



  

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by
such person of a bond in such amount as the Paying Agent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof.

  



  

2.3   _No Appraisal Rights_ (a). Holders of shares of Seller Common
Stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in respect of such shares provided
for under Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the MGCL and Seller's Articles of
Incorporation.

  



  

2.4   _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. Buyer may at any
time change the method of effecting any of the Transactions if and to the
extent that it deems such a change to be desirable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such change shall (a) alter or change the amount or form of the
consideration to be issued to holders of shares as Merger Consideration as
currently contemplated in this Agreement; (b) reasonably be expected to
materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger; (c) require submission
to or approval of Seller's shareholders after receipt of the Requisite Seller
Vote; (d) require approval of regulators after receipt of Regulatory
Approval; or (e) result in the imposition of a Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition. In the event that Buyer elects to make such a change,
the parties agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect the change.

3.1   _Making of Representations and Warranties_.

  



  

(a) On or prior to the date hereof, Seller has delivered to
Buyer a letter that will be treated confidentially (the " _Seller Disclosure
Letter_ ") listing, among other things, items the disclosure of which is
necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision of this Agreement or as an exception to
one or more representations or warranties contained in _Article III_ or to
one or more of its covenants contained in _Article V_ ; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that (i) the mere inclusion of an item in the Seller Disclosure
Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an
admission by Seller that such item represents a material exception or fact,
event or circumstance or that such item is or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Seller, and (ii) any
disclosure made with respect to a section of this _Article III_ shall be
deemed to qualify any other section of this _Article III _ (A) specifically
referenced or cross-referenced in such disclosure or (B) to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross-reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies

(b) Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Letter or in
the Seller Reports, Seller and Seller Bank represent and warrant, jointly
and severally, to Buyer that the statements contained in this _Article III_

Closing Date (as though made on and as of the Closing Date), except as to any
representation or warranty which specifically speaks as of an earlier date
(including without limitation representations made as of "the date of this
Agreement"), which only need be correct as of the specified earlier date. No
representation or warranty of Seller contained in this _Article III_ shall be
deemed untrue or incorrect, and Seller shall not be deemed to have breached a
representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of any fact,
circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance, or event,
individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events
inconsistent with any section of this _Article III_ , has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Seller, disregarding for the purposes of this _Section 3.1(b)_ any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification contained in any
representation or warranty;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
standard shall not apply to the representations and warranties contained
in (a) _Section 3.3(a)_ , which shall be deemed untrue and incorrect if not
true and correct except to a _de minimis_ extent, (b) _Sections 3.8_ and
_3.9(a)_ , which shall be deemed untrue and incorrect if not true and correct,
and (c) _Sections 3.2(a)_ , _3.3(b)_ , _3.4(a)_ and _3.4(b)(i)_ , which shall
be deemed untrue and incorrect if not true and correct in all material
respects.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

 (i) " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Buyer, Seller or Seller Bank, as the case may be, any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which would materially impair the ability of such party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise materially impairs the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby or actions or omissions expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior written consent of the other party, including expenses incurred by the parties, in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (E) a decline in the trading or market prices of Seller Common Stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or internal financial forecasts, but not, in either case, including any underlying causes thereof or (F) natural disaster or other force majeure event; except, with respect to subclause (A), (B), (C) or (F), to the extent that the effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate.

(ii) " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any person,
means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or person of which (x)
such first person directly or indirectly owns or controls at least a majority
of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting
power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing
similar functions or (y) such first person is or directly or indirectly has

3.2 _Corporate Organization_.

  



  

(a) Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland and is a savings and
loan holding company duly registered under the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Seller has
the corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Seller is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased
or operated by it makes such licensing, qualification or standing necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good
standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller. True and complete
copies of the Articles of Incorporation of Seller (the " _Seller Articles_
") and the Bylaws of Seller (the " _Seller Bylaws_ "), in each case as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available
by Seller to Buyer.

  



  

(b) Seller Bank is a bank that is a member of the Federal
Reserve System duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Connecticut. The deposit accounts of Seller Bank are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through
the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act of 1950 (the " _FDIA_ ")) to the fullest extent permitted by
law. All premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith
have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such
insurance are pending or, to the knowledge of Seller Bank, threatened. Seller
Bank is a member in good standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Boston (the " _FHLB_ ") and owns the requisite amount of stock therein.

and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and Connecticut Department of
Banking promulgated thereunder.

(c) Each Subsidiary of Seller (i) is duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is
duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all
jurisdictions (whether federal, state or local) where its ownership, leasing
or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
licensed or qualified or in good standing, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Seller and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease or operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of
Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller to pay dividends or distributions except,
in the case of Seller or a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for
restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all
similarly regulated entities. _Section 3.2(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of Seller that would
constitute "significant subsidiaries" within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of
Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") as of

(a) The authorized capital stock of Seller consists of
100,000,000 Shares of Seller Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and

other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on which

this Agreement, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
commitments or agreements obligating Seller to issue, transfer, sell,

(b) Seller owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests
of each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, claims, title
defects, mortgages, pledges, charges, encumbrances and security interests
whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such shares or equity ownership interests
are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. No Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of
any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.3(c)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter or in the Seller Reports, since January 1, 2016, Seller has
not repurchased any shares of Seller Common Stock.

  



  

(d) _Section 3.3(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth
a true, correct and complete list and description of each offering of
equity securities (or securities convertible or exchangeable into, or
exercisable for, equity securities) of Seller made by Seller within the past
five years (all such offerings, whether or not listed in _Section 3.3(d)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, a " _Seller Offering_ "), including a
description of the securities issued, the date of issuance, the amount of
shares issued, and the offering price. Seller has, in connection with each
Seller Offering, complied in all material respects with all laws with respect
thereto, including all federal and state securities laws.

  



  

3.4   _Authority; No Violation_.

  



  

(a) Seller and Seller Bank have full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger have been duly and
validly approved by the Boards of Directors of Seller and Seller Bank. The
Board of Directors of Seller has determined that the Merger, on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, is advisable and in the best interests
of Seller and its shareholders, has unanimously adopted and approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger, Bank
Combination and Dissolution), and has directed that this Agreement be
submitted to Seller's shareholders for approval at a meeting of such
shareholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for
the approval of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock (the " _Requisite
Seller Vote_ "), no other corporate proceedings on the part of Seller or
Seller Bank are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Seller and Seller Bank and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Seller and Seller Bank, enforceable against Seller and
Seller Bank in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws of general applicability affecting the
rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies (the
" _Enforceability Exceptions_ ")).

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Seller and Seller Bank nor the consummation by Seller and Seller Bank of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger, Bank Combination and
Dissolution), nor compliance by Seller and Seller Bank with any of the terms
or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Seller Articles or
the Seller Bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents of any of its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) assuming that the consents and approvals referred to
in _Section 3.5_ are duly obtained, (x) violate any law, statute, code,

cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clauses (x) and (y)
above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults that, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Seller.

  



  

3.5   _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a) the filing of any
required applications, filings, and notices, as applicable, with the FDIC in
connection with the Merger and Bank Combination, and approval of or non-

commission or other governmental or regulatory authority or instrumentality
(each a " _Governmental Entity_ ") are necessary in connection with (i) the
execution and delivery by Seller and Seller Bank of this Agreement or (ii)
the consummation by Seller and Seller Bank of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger, Bank Combination and Dissolution). As of the

11

 



    

   



  

3.6 _Reports_. Seller and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed
(or furnished) all reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and
statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, that they were required to file (or furnish, as applicable) since
January 1, 2016 with (i) any state regulatory authority, including the
Connecticut Banking Department, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the Federal Reserve
Board, (iv) the FDIC, (v) and any SRO (clauses (i) - (v), collectively  "
_Regulatory Agencies_ "), and have paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith, except where the failure to file (or
furnish, as applicable) such report, form, correspondence, registration or
statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Seller. Subject to _Section 9.14_ , except for normal examinations
conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of Seller
and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any
proceeding or, to the knowledge of Seller or Seller Bank, investigation into
the business or operations of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries since January
1, 2016, except where such proceedings or investigations would not reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Seller. Subject to _Section 9.14_ , there (i) is no
unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with
respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) has been no formal or informal
inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with
respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2016, in each case, which would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Seller.

  



  

3.7 _Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) Seller has previously made available to Buyer a true, correct and
complete copy of the audited consolidated balance sheets of Seller and its
Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2019 (the " _Most Recent Balance Sheet_ ") and
June 30, 2018, and the related audited consolidated statements of net income,
comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows of
Seller and its Subsidiaries for each of the years then ended, together with
all related notes and schedules thereto, accompanied by the report thereon of
Seller's independent auditors (collectively referred to as the " _Audited
Financial Statements_ " and, together with the Most Recent Balance Sheet, the
" _Financial Statements_ "). The Financial Statements (i) were prepared from,
and are in accordance with, the books and records of Seller and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders' equity and
consolidated financial position of Seller and its Subsidiaries for the
respective fiscal periods and as of the respective dates therein set forth
and (iii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during
the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such Financial
Statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of Seller and its
Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Wolf and Company, P.C.,
Seller's independent auditor, has not resigned (or informed Seller that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Seller as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Seller on
a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Seller,
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether
due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the Most Recent Balance Sheet (including any notes
thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since
the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Seller
and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership of Seller or its
Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Seller. Seller (x) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_")) to
ensure that material information relating to Seller, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Seller by others within those entities as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, in
writing to Seller's outside auditors and the audit committee of Seller's Board
of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Seller's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Seller's internal controls over financial reporting. There is no reason to
believe that Seller's chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

  



  

(d) Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Seller, any director,
officer, auditor, accountant or representative of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no
attorney representing Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Seller
or any committee thereof or the Board of Directors or similar governing body
of any Subsidiary or any committee thereof, or to the knowledge of Seller, to
any director or officer of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

3.8 _Broker 's Fees_. With the exception of the engagement of Keefe,
Bruyette and Woods, Inc., neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or
financial advisor or incurred any liability for any broker's fees,
commissions or finder's fees in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Seller has disclosed to Buyer as of the date
hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the engagement by
Seller of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. related to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

3.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

  



  

(a) Since June 30, 2019, (i) no event or events have occurred that
have had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Seller and (ii) there has not been
any Tax election made or changed, any annual accounting period changed, any
adjustment of any Tax attribute agreed to or any right to claim a refund of
Taxes surrendered.

  



  

(b) Since June 30, 2019, except with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, Seller and its Subsidiaries have carried on their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business.

  



  

(c) Since June 30, 2019, except with respect to matters set forth in
_Section 3.9(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, neither Seller nor its
Subsidiaries have taken any action or failed to take any action that would
have resulted in a breach of  _Section 5.2_ of this Agreement had such act or
omission occurred during the period from the date hereof to the
Effective Time.

  



  

3.10   _Legal and Regulatory Proceedings_.

  



  

(a) Except as filed with any Seller Reports, neither Seller nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no outstanding or
pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened, legal, administrative,

").

  



  

(c) Each Seller Benefit Plan has been established, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither Seller nor any
of its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective action or made a
filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, the DOL or any other
Governmental Entity with respect to any Seller Benefit Plan, and neither
Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that

Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a favorable determination or opinion letter
with respect to each Seller Qualified Plan and the related trust,
which letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation been threatened), and,
to the knowledge of Seller, there are no existing circumstances and no events
have occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status of any Seller
Qualified Plan or the exempt status of the related trust or increase the
costs relating thereto. No trust funding any Seller Benefit Plan is intended
to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

(e) Each Seller Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the
Code has been administered and documented in compliance with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code, except where any non-compliance has not and
cannot reasonably be expected to result in material liability to Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries or any employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) No Seller Benefit Plan is, and none of Seller, its Subsidiaries
nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate has at any time during the last six (6) years
sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
plan that is, subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Sections 412,
430 or 4971 of the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Seller
ERISA Affiliate_ " means any trade or business, whether or not incorporated,

meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA.

those terms are defined in Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.

  



  

(h) Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has
sponsored or has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan

life insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees or
beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of
the Code, and Seller has complied in all material respects with such section
of the Code and with applicable state health care continuation coverage laws.

  



  

(i) All contributions required to be made to any Seller Benefit Plan
by applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking,
and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Seller Benefit Plan, in each case, for any period through the date hereof,

made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the
books and records of Seller to the extent required by GAAP.

  



  

(j) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened
claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business),
lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to the
knowledge of Seller, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably be
expected to give rise to a claim, lawsuit or arbitration, against the Seller
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the
Seller Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Seller Benefit Plans, in each case that could reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to the
PBGC, the IRS, the DOL, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any
participant in any Seller Benefit Plan, or any other party.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

(k) None of Seller and its Subsidiaries nor any Seller ERISA
Affiliate nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the Seller Benefit Plans or their
related trusts, Seller, any of its Subsidiaries, any Seller ERISA Affiliate or
any person that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to
indemnify, to any material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

  



  

(l) Except as set forth in _Section 3.12( _l_ )_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or
in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting,
exercisability, delivery or funding of, or increase in the amount or value of,
any payment, compensation (including stock or stock-based), right or other
benefit to any employee, officer, director, independent
contractor, consultant or other service provider of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets
from any Seller Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property, or in the form of benefits) by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any
other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. Seller has made available to Buyer true, correct and
complete copies of Section 280G calculations (whether or not final) with
respect to any disqualified individual in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

(m) No Seller Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement
of Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise. Neither Seller
nor any of its Subsidiaries remain subject to any compensation-related
limitations or restrictions imposed by or related to Section 111 of the
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended.

  



  

(n) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened
material labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges
against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material
labor disputes against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Seller nor
any of its Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any collective bargaining or
similar agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices
agreed to with any labor organization or employee association applicable to
employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of
Seller, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking
to represent any employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and no
employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries are represented by any labor
organization.

  



  

(o) To the knowledge of Seller, no current or former employee or
independent contractor of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is in violation
in any material respect of any term of any restrictive covenant obligation,
including any non-compete, non-solicit, non-interference, non-disparagement
or confidentiality obligation (" _Restrictive Covenant_ ") or any
employment or consulting contract, common law nondisclosure obligation,
fiduciary duty, or other obligation: (i) to Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) to a former employer of any such individual relating (A)
to the right of any such individual to work for Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or (B) to the knowledge or use of trade secrets or proprietary
information.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(p) The ESOP was validly authorized and established in accordance
with applicable laws. The trust under the ESOP (the " _Trust_ ") is a trust
established in accordance with Section 501(a) of the Code and is administered
and interpreted in all material respects in accordance with the laws of the
State of Connecticut. The trustee of the Trust (the " _Trustee_ ") has the
requisite power and authority to carry out its duties under the Trust and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The ESOP has received a
determination from the IRS that the ESOP meets the applicable qualification
requirements of Section 401(a) of Code and, to the knowledge of Seller, since
the date of such determination (i) such qualified status has not been revoked
and (ii) nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause
revocation of such qualified status. The shares of Seller Common Stock held by
the Trust constitute "employer securities" as defined in Section 409(l) of
the Code and "qualifying employer securities" as defined in Section 407(d)(5)
of ERISA. Other than the outstanding indebtedness (as of the Closing Date)
owed to Seller by the ESOP pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement, dated as of
January 1, 2016, by and between Seller and the Trustee (the " _ESOP Loan_ ")
and outstanding invoices from service providers, there is no existing
indebtedness of the ESOP.

accurate and complete copy of each (a) final registration
statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed
with or furnished to the SEC since January 1, 2016 by Seller pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the Exchange
Act (the " _Seller Reports_ ") and (b) communication mailed by Seller to its
shareholders since January 1, 2016 and prior to the date hereof, and no such
Seller Report or communication, as of the date thereof (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date
of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date. Since January 1, 2016, as of their respective dates, all Seller Reports
filed or furnished under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied
in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto. No executive officer of Seller has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

since January 1, 2016, held, all licenses, registrations, franchises,
certificates, variances, permits, charters and authorizations necessary for
the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their
respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have
paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith),
except where neither the cost or failure to hold such licenses,
registrations, franchises, certificates, variances, permits, charters and
authorizations (nor the failure to pay any such fee or assessment)
would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller and, to the knowledge of Seller, no
suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license, registration,
franchise, certificate, variance, permit, charter or authorization is
threatened.

  



  

   

21

Secrecy Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair
Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act,
the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, any
regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the SAFE
Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and

non-compliance, defaults or violations that would not, either individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Seller. Seller Bank has a Community Reinvestment Act rating of "satisfactory"
or better.

  



  

(c) Seller Bank maintains a written information privacy and security
program that maintains reasonable measures to protect the privacy,
confidentiality and security of all Personal Data against any (i) loss or
misuse of Personal Data, (ii) unauthorized or unlawful operations performed
upon Personal Data, or (iii) other act or omission that compromises the
security or confidentiality of Personal Data (clauses (i) through (iii), a "
_Security Breach_ "). To the knowledge of Seller, since January 1, 2016,
neither Seller nor Seller Bank has experienced any Security Breach. To the
knowledge of Seller, there are no data security or other technological
vulnerabilities with respect to Seller's and Seller Bank's information
technology systems or networks.

capitalized" (as such term is defined in the relevant regulation of the
institution's primary bank regulator).

  



  

(e) (i) Seller and each of its Subsidiaries have properly
administered in all material respects all accounts for which it acts as a

applicable state and federal law; and (ii) none of Seller, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or its Subsidiaries' directors, officers or
employees, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect
to any such fiduciary account, and the accountings for each such fiduciary

 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  



  

6.1 _Regulatory Matters_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use
their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings (and in the case of the applications, notices, petitions and filings
in respect of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, within forty-five (45) days
of the date of this Agreement), to obtain as promptly as practicable all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger, Bank Combination
and Dissolution), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental
Entities. Buyer and Seller shall have the right to review in advance, and, to
the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, and any of
Seller's Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or
conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences, in each case subject to
applicable law. As used in this Agreement, " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_
" means (i) all regulatory authorizations, consents, permits, orders,
approvals, waivers or non-objections from the FDIC, the Director of the Rhode
Island Department of Business Regulation, Division of Banks, the Commissioner
of the Connecticut Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Board and (ii)
any other approvals set forth in _Sections 3.5_ and _4.4_ , in each case (x)
that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger, Bank Combination and Dissolution) or (y) the failure of
which to be obtained would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer.

  



  

   

44

 



    



  

(b) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objection that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to require Buyer or Seller or any of Seller's
Subsidiaries, and neither Buyer nor Seller nor any of Seller's Subsidiaries
shall be permitted (without the written consent of the other party), to take
any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing regulatory
authorizations, consents, permits, orders, approvals, waivers or non-
objections of Governmental Entities that would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer, after giving effect to the Merger, Bank
Combination or Dissolution (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_
").

  



  

(c) Buyer and Seller shall, upon request, furnish each other with
all information concerning themselves, affiliates, subsidiaries,
directors, officers, depositors and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of parties to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Buyer and Seller shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained, will
be obtained subject to a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition or that
the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

  



  

6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, Seller,
for the purposes of enabling Buyer to verify the representations
and warranties of Seller and to prepare for the Merger and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, subject to _Section 9.14_ , afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of Buyer,
access, during normal business hours during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, to all of Seller's properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, Tax
Returns and related work papers and records reasonably requested by Buyer.
Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in preparing to execute after the Effective
Time the conversion or consolidation of systems, including, but not limited
to, the conversion of Seller Bank's data processing and related electronic
informational systems to those used by Buyer, and business
operations generally, and, during such period, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, promptly make available to Buyer (i) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received
by Buyer during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or
documents which Seller is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and
(ii) all other information concerning Seller's business, properties and
personnel as Buyer may reasonably request. Neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of Seller's customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due
consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or
similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. Seller will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  



  

   

45

 



    



  

(b) Seller shall promptly (and in any event, not later than two (2)
business days after first delivered or made available to the Boards
of Directors of Seller and Seller Bank) provide (or cause to be provided) to
Buyer copies of any regularly prepared materials for the Boards of Directors
of Seller and Seller Bank, including monthly financial statements and other
regular monthly reports so provided to the Boards of Directors of Seller and
Seller Bank; provided that the Seller and Seller Bank may redact (i) board
and committee minutes that discuss the Merger or the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement or any other subject matter Seller reasonably
determines should be treated as confidential, (ii) any information prior to
providing such materials to Buyer to the extent that any such information is
subject to the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine and (iii)
any non-confidential supervisory information.

  



  

(c) Buyer shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of
Seller or its representatives pursuant to _Sections 6.2(a)_ and _6.2(b) _ in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of the confidentiality agreement, dated August 29, 2019, between Buyer and
Seller and the confidentiality agreement, dated September 23, 2019, between
Buyer and Seller (collectively, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

(d) In addition to all documents referenced in this _Section 6.2_ ,
Seller agrees to maintain, in the ordinary course of business consistent with
recent past practice, all electronic records (including e-mails) of Seller and
its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and employees in
effect as of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(e) No investigation (or discovery or receipt of information) by
any party hereto or their respective representatives shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement of the other parties set forth herein or the conditions to any
party's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give any party hereto, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its affiliates' and
subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



  

   

46

 



    



  

6.3 _Seller Shareholders ' Approval_.

  



  

(a) Following the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall take, in
accordance with applicable law and the Seller Articles and the Seller Bylaws,
all action necessary to convene an annual or special meeting of its
shareholders as promptly as practicable for the purpose of obtaining (i) the
Requisite Seller Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger and (ii) if so desired and mutually agreed by the parties, the
approval of other matters of the type customarily brought before an annual
or special meeting of shareholders to approve a merger agreement or otherwise
approve the transactions contemplated hereby (such meeting, including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Meetin_ g"). In furtherance and
without limitation of the foregoing, Seller, at its expense, shall promptly
mail (or cause to be mailed) the Proxy Statement of Seller relating to
the Meeting. Without limiting the scope of this _Section 6.3(a)_ , Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mail the Proxy Statement to
Seller's shareholders as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, but in no event later than sixty (60) days of the date of this
Agreement. If at any time prior to the Meeting there shall occur any event
that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, Seller shall promptly prepare and, after consultation with Buyer,
mail to the holders of Shares such an amendment or supplement. Buyer shall
cooperate with Seller in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, any
amendment or supplement thereto, and any other communication that could
reasonably be deemed to be proxy solicitation materials relating to the
Merger (collectively, the " _Proxy Materials_ ") and shall furnish Seller with
all information relating to Buyer that Seller reasonably determines in
necessary to be included in, or otherwise in respect of, the Proxy
Materials. Buyer and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review any Proxy Material prior to its dissemination to the holders of the
Shares, and Seller shall give appropriate consideration to making any change
to the Proxy Material reasonably requested by Buyer.

  



  

(b) Seller may engage a proxy solicitor on terms and conditions
acceptable to both Seller and Buyer. Seller shall keep Buyer updated
with respect to the proxy solicitation results in connection with the Meeting
as reasonably requested by Buyer.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 6.3(d)_ , the Board of Directors of Seller
shall (i) recommend to its shareholders the adoption of this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Recommendation_
"), (ii) include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Seller the
Requisite Seller Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders the
Recommendation and (iv) not withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or
propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Buyer, the Recommendation or take any action, or make any public
statement, filing or release inconsistent with the Recommendation, or submit
this Agreement to Seller's shareholders for a vote without the
Recommendation.

  



  

(d) Subject to _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ , if the Board of
Directors of Seller, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and,
with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good
faith that it would be a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement
to Seller's shareholders, the Board of Directors of Seller may (but shall not
be required to) submit this Agreement to Seller's shareholders without, or
with a recommendation adverse to, the Recommendation (an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") (although the resolutions approving this Agreement
as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the
Board of Directors of Seller may communicate the basis for the Adverse
Recommendation Change to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by
applicable law; provided that the Board of Directors of Seller may not take
any action under this _Section 6.3(d)_ unless (i) such action is taken in
response to an Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal (x) did not
result from a breach by Seller of _Section 6.13_ and (y) constitutes a
Superior Proposal; (ii) Seller gives Buyer at least three (3) business days'
prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable
description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its determination to
take such action (including its basis for determining that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (including the latest material terms
and conditions of, and the identity of the third party making, the
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof)); (iii)
during such three (3) business day period, Seller has considered and
negotiated (and has caused its representatives to consider and
negotiate) with Buyer in good faith (to the extent Buyer desires to so
negotiate) regarding any adjustments or modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement proposed by Buyer; and (iv) at the end of such
notice period, the Board of Directors of Seller takes into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Buyer (it being
understood that Buyer shall not have any obligation to propose any
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement), and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, again determines in good
faith that it would nevertheless result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement and that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. Any material amendment
to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal
for purposes of this _Section 6.3(d)_ and will require a new
determination and notice period as referred to in this _Section 6.3(d)_.

  



  

   

47

 



    



  

(e) Seller shall adjourn or postpone the Meeting if, (i) as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Seller Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Meeting or (ii)
on the date of the Meeting, Seller has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Seller Vote;
provided that, from and after such time, if any, that (in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that has been received by Seller and that has been
publicly disclosed or otherwise become public) Seller makes an Adverse
Recommendation Change that is permitted by _Section 6.3(d)_ , Seller
thereafter shall not be so required to adjourn or postpone the Meeting.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Meeting shall be convened
and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Seller at the
Meeting for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the
other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to relieve Seller of such obligation, including if Seller makes an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

  



  

6.4   _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to
_Section 6.1_ of this Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller shall, and Seller
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ , to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Merger, Bank Combination and Dissolution) and
(b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material
consent, authorization, permit, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by Buyer or Seller or any of Seller's Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

   

48

 



    



   



  

6.5 _Exchange Act Deregistration_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall cooperate with Buyer and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable SEC rules to
enable the deregistration of the Seller Common Stock under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

  



  

6.6 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Buyer shall endeavor to retain as many of Seller's and Seller
Bank's employees as it deems reasonably practical in its sole discretion.
Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to provide employees of Seller and its
Subsidiaries with meaningful career opportunities at Buyer following the
Merger and Bank Combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement is
not intended to provide to any employee a legally enforceable right to
continuing employment after the Effective Time, and any employees of Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries that continue employment with Buyer following the
Effective Time shall become employees at will of Buyer.

  



  

(b) At and after the Effective Time, and except as set forth in
_Section 6.6(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, Buyer will provide any
employee of Seller and Seller Bank who is not otherwise covered by an
individual severance or change in control agreement and whose employment is
involuntarily terminated by Buyer without Cause (as defined below) or
voluntarily terminates employment as a result of not being offered
substantially similar employment, determined in the good faith judgment of
Buyer (for purposes of clarity, reporting to a different supervisor or having
a different title shall not entitle an employee to severance under this
_Section 6.6(b)_ ) or as a result of a relocation of his or her principal
place of employment by more than thirty (30) miles from the location of his
or her principal place of employment on the date of this Agreement within
twelve (12) months following the Effective Time with a lump sum cash
severance payment equal to two (2) weeks of pay for each full year of
service with Seller or Seller Bank, with a minimum benefit of four (4) weeks
and a maximum benefit of twenty-six (26) weeks, with such payment made within
ten (10) business days of the date of termination and subject to such person's
execution of a customary release in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.
For purposes of this _Section 6.6(b)_, the following, as determined by Buyer
in its reasonable judgment, shall constitute " _Cause_ " for termination: (i)
conviction of or plea of _nolo contendere_ to a felony or other crime
involving dishonesty or theft, or likely to result in imprisonment; (ii)
fraud, theft, embezzlement, other material dishonesty or any material breach
of a fiduciary duty owed to Buyer, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii)
material failure to perform, or gross neglect or recklessness in the
performance of, duties and responsibilities to Buyer, Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries; (iv) willful failure or willful refusal to follow the
directions or instructions of Buyer; or (v) material violation of any of
Buyer's applicable employment policies.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall take all reasonable
action so that employees of Seller or Seller Bank who are employed by Buyer
at or after the Effective Time (i) shall receive employee benefits which are
at a level comparable in the aggregate to similarly-situated employees of
Buyer and (ii) shall be entitled to participate in the Buyer Benefit Plans at
a level comparable to similarly-situated employees of Buyer (it being
understood that inclusion of the employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries
in the Buyer Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to
different Buyer Benefit Plans) to the extent that such participation does not
result in a duplication of benefits. Unless an employee of Seller
affirmatively terminates coverage under any medical, dental, vision, health
or disability plan of Seller (the " _Seller Health Plan_ ") prior to the time
that such employee becomes eligible to participate in the Health Plan, no
coverage of any of Seller employees or their dependents shall terminate under
any of the Seller Health Plans prior to the time such employees and their
dependents become covered under the health plans, programs and benefits
provided to similarly-situated employees of Buyer and their dependents. Buyer
shall cause each Buyer Benefit Plan in which employees of Seller or Seller
Bank are eligible to participate to recognize the service of such employees
with Seller or Seller Bank, as applicable (to the same extent as such service
was credited for such purpose immediately prior to the Effective Time), for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate in such Buyer Benefit Plan
and the vesting of benefits, but not for purposes of accrual of benefits
under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that recognizing the
service of such employees would result in a duplication of benefits.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(d) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
Seller and Seller Bank shall adopt resolutions to terminate any Seller
Benefit Plan intended to qualify as a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (the "
_Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") and shall provide Buyer with evidence that the Seller
401(k) Plan has been terminated (effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board
of Directors of Seller. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to Buyer's review and approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Seller and its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, shall also take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating the Seller 401(k) Plan as Buyer may reasonably request prior to
the Closing Date, including the adoption of amendments to the Seller 401(k)
Plan. The accounts of all participants and beneficiaries in the Seller 401(k)
Plan shall become fully vested upon termination of such plan. As soon as
practicable following termination of such plan, the account balances in the
Seller 401(k) Plan shall be distributed as a participant or beneficiary may
direct, consistent with applicable laws and regulations. Any participant that
continues employment with Buyer and who elects to participate in any Buyer
Benefit Plan intended to qualify as a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (the  "
_Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ") may elect to have his or her account balance rolled
over into the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

  



  

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall have sole
discretion with respect to the determination as to whether or when to
terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans and programs of Seller
or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) In the event of any termination of any Seller or Seller Bank
medical, dental, vision, health or disability plan (collectively,  " _Health
Plan_ "), Buyer shall make available to the former Seller and Seller Bank
employees (and their dependents) that continue employment with Buyer, Health
Plan coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage to similarly-
situated Buyer employees, provided that Buyer shall cause each such Health
Plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such
conditions are covered under the applicable Health Plans of Buyer, (ii) waive
any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which
would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time
to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous Health Plan prior to the Effective Time and
(iii) provide credit towards the deductible and out-of-pocket maximum for
eligible expenses incurred by the employees of Seller or Seller Bank under
the Seller Health Plans for the plan year in which coverage commences under
the Buyer Health Plan.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(g) Buyer agrees to assume and honor the terms of each of the change
in control agreements with the employees of Seller as set forth in _Section
6.6(g)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, except to the extent any such
agreement is superseded or terminated as of, or following, the Effective
Time. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall obtain
from Thomas Borner, Robert Halloran, Kim Bushey, Lori Bannister and Robert
Trivella, in the form included in _Section 6.6(g)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, an executed settlement agreement to accept in full
settlement of his or her rights under his or her change in control
agreement, and an executed consulting and release agreement with Thomas
Borner in the form included in _Section 6.6(g)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, to be effective as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(h) Buyer agrees to honor and maintain the Seller Bank Amended and
Restated Deferred Compensation Retirement Plan (" _Deferred Plan_ ") as set
forth in _Section 6.6(h)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and, unless
otherwise agreed to in writing, Buyer agrees that the timing and amount of
the payments thereunder will not be accelerated and will continue to be made
in accordance with the terms of such plan. Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, Buyer shall provide each participant in the Deferred Plan a
signed letter in the form included in _Section 6.6(h)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(i) Neither Seller, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any officer,
director, manager, employee, agent or representative of Seller or its
Subsidiaries shall make any communication to service providers of Seller or
its Subsidiaries regarding any Buyer Benefit Plan or any compensation or
benefits to be provided after the Effective Time without the advance approval
of Buyer.

  



  

(j) No provision in this Agreement shall modify or amend any other
agreement, plan, program, or document relating to a Seller Benefit Plan
unless this Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" that other
agreement, plan, program, or document. This shall not prevent the parties
entitled to enforce this Agreement from enforcing any provision in this
Agreement, but no other party shall be entitled to enforce any provision in
this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to another agreement,
plan, program, or document relating to a Seller Benefit Plan, unless the
provision is explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, and the person
is otherwise entitled to enforce the other agreement, plan, program, or
document. If a party not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit
or other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to
another agreement, plan, program, or document, and that provision is construed
to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly designated as one in
this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its inception,
thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless and
shall advance expenses as incurred, in each case to the extent such persons
are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to the
Seller Articles, the Seller Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents
of any Subsidiary of Seller and any indemnification agreements in existence
as of the date hereof and disclosed in _Section 6.7(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, each present and former director, officer or employee of
Seller and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, amounts
paid in settlement, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether
arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer or employee of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that in the case of advancement of expenses, any
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification. An Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
the reimbursement of reasonable legal expenses incurred in any
successful claim hereunder to enforce its rights to indemnification and
advancement.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Buyer
shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by Seller (provided that Buyer may
substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are
no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis,
an amount that, in the aggregate, exceeds 175% of the current annual premium
paid as of the date hereof by Seller for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_
"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the
Premium Cap, then Buyer shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
that, in Buyer's good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available for an aggregate cost equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
foregoing, Seller, in consultation with Buyer, but only upon the prior written
consent of Buyer, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, may (and at the request of Buyer, Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year prepaid
"tail" policy under Seller's existing directors and officers insurance policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if
and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the
aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap and, in such case, Buyer shall not
have any further obligations under this _Section 6.7(b)_ , other than to
maintain such prepaid "tail" policy.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Buyer or
any of its successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge into any
other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of its assets or
deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction, then in
each case, Buyer will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors
and assigns of Buyer will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.7_. The obligations of Buyer and Seller under this _Section 6.7_
shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as to adversely affect the
Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this
_Section 6.7_ without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified
Party or affected person.

  



  

   

52

 



    



  

(d) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Section 6.7_
are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with Section 18(k) of
the FDIA (12 U.S.C. § 1828(k)) and the regulations promulgated thereunder by
the FDIC (12 C.F.R. Part 359).

  



  

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement or to vest Buyer with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the
Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and
their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer.

  



  

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Buyer and Seller shall each promptly (but
in no event more than twenty-four (24) hours) advise the other party of any
change or event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected
to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of any
condition in _Article VII_ ; provided, that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed
to constitute a violation of this _Section 6.9_ or the failure of any
condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result
in a failure of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be
satisfied.

  



  

6.10 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Seller and Buyer shall promptly
notify the other party in writing of any action, arbitration, audit,
hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, dispute, proceeding, subpoena or
summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or
otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the
knowledge of either such party, threatened against Seller, Buyer or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, in each case that (a) questions or would
reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby or any actions taken or to be
taken by Buyer, Seller or their respective Subsidiaries with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (b)
seeks to enjoin, restrain or prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby.
Seller shall give Buyer the opportunity to consult on the defense or
settlement of any shareholder litigation against Seller and/or its directors,
officers or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and Seller will in good faith take any comments of Buyer into
account), and Seller shall not agree to any such settlement of any such
litigation without Buyer's prior written consent which shall not unreasonably
be withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

6.11 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, Seller will
provide Buyer with five (5) business days or more notice of any declaration
of dividend in respect of Seller Common Stock or the setting of a record date
therefor.

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

6.12 _Corporate Governance_. Buyer shall take all action necessary to
appoint one member of the Board of Directors of Seller (the " _Designated
Seller Director_ ") to the Board of Trustees of Buyer, effective as of and
conditioned upon the Closing. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall offer each
member of the Boards of Directors of Seller and Seller Bank who is not
appointed a trustee of Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6.12_ the opportunity
to serve as a corporator of Buyer, and Buyer's Board of Trustees shall
recommend that Buyer's corporators elect as corporators of Buyer, as of the
annual meeting of corporators next following the receipt of the Requisite
Seller Vote, the Designated Seller Director and each other member of the
Boards of Directors of Seller and Seller Bank who expresses an interest in
serving as a corporator of Buyer and who, in Buyer's good faith judgment,
satisfies Buyer's selection criteria for its corporators generally, effective
as of and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time.

  



  

6.13 _Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) Seller agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any
person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to any person (other than Buyer and
its representatives in their capacity as such) concerning any Acquisition
Proposal or (iv) have or participate in any discussions with any person
(other than Buyer and its representatives in their capacity as such) relating
to any Acquisition Proposal, except, for purposes of this clause (iv), to
notify such person of the existence of the provisions of this _Section
6.13(a)_ ; provided that prior to the date of the Meeting, in the event
Seller receives from any person other than Buyer or its representatives
an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 6.13_ , it may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data to, and participate in,
discussions with such person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal but
only to the extent that, prior to doing so, its Board of Directors concludes
in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that (A) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal
and (B) failure to take such actions would result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, further, that, prior to
providing any nonpublic information or data or participating in any
discussions, in each case, permitted pursuant to the foregoing proviso,
Seller shall have provided such information or data to Buyer and shall
have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such person on terms no
less stringent to such person than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Seller or
its representatives. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.13_ by any
Subsidiary or representative of Seller shall constitute a breach of this
_Section 6.13_ by Seller.

  



  

(b) Seller will, and will cause its representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the execution of this Agreement with any person (other than
Buyer and its representatives in their capacity as such) with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to
applicable law, to enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

   

54

 



    



  

(c) Promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, Seller shall advise
Buyer of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the substance thereof
(including the terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making
such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, copies of any written Acquisition
Proposal and written summaries of any material oral communications relating to
an Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Buyer apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal.

  



  

(d) As used herein,

  



  

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to,
or any third party indication of interest in, (A) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Seller and
its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Seller or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Seller; (B)
any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any person (other than Buyer) beneficially
owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Seller or
its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Seller; or (C) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving Seller and/or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Seller; and

  



  

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited _bona fide_
written offer or proposal made by a third party to consummate an Acquisition
Proposal that Seller's Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisor) (A) would, if consummated, result in the
acquisition of all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding
shares of Seller Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of
Seller; (B) would result in a transaction that (1) involves consideration to
the holders of the shares of Seller Common Stock that is more favorable, from
a financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to the
shareholders of Seller pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other
things, the nature of the consideration being offered and which proposal is
not conditioned upon obtaining financing and (2) is, in light of the other
terms of such proposal, more favorable to the shareholders of Seller than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement considering,
among other things, and any material regulatory approvals or other risks
associated with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond, or in
addition to, those specifically contemplated hereby; and (C) is reasonably
likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case, taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition
Proposal.

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

6.14 _Board and Committee Meetings_. Following the receipt of the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals, Seller shall permit representatives of Buyer
(no more than two (2)) to attend any meeting of the Boards of Directors of
Seller or Seller Bank or the executive and loan committees thereof as an
observer, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that Seller shall
not be required to permit such representatives to remain present during any
confidential discussions of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal or during any
other matter (a) that the Board of Directors of Seller or Seller Bank has
reasonably determined to be confidential with respect to the participation of
Buyer or (b) that Seller or Seller Bank would not be required to disclose
under _Section 6.2_ of this Agreement.

  



  

6.15 _Public Announcements_. Seller and Buyer shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to (a) develop a joint communications plan and ensure
that all press releases and other public disclosure (including communications
to employees, agents and contractors) with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with such joint communications
plan and (b) consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to
the extent practicable, otherwise making any public disclosure with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except in respect
of any press release or public disclosure the content and messaging of which
is substantially similar to public disclosure previously made by Buyer or
Seller either on the date of this Agreement or following the date of this
Agreement and in accordance with this _Section 6.15_.

  



  

6.16 _Operating Functions_. To the extent permitted by applicable law
and upon Buyer's request, Seller shall regularly discuss and reasonably
cooperate with Buyer in connection with (a) planning for the efficient and
orderly combination of Seller, Seller Bank and Buyer and the operation of
Buyer, (b) preparing for the consolidation of appropriate operating functions
to be effective at the Effective Time or such later date as Buyer may decide,
(c) planning for the tax-efficient operation of Buyer and (d) providing such
information, as may be reasonably requested by Buyer from time to time, to
assist Buyer in the calculation of any potential termination penalties of the
Seller Contracts referred to in _Section 3.15(a)(xvii)_ and set forth in
_Section 3.15(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Each party shall
cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally (including by
entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and
similar agreements with related service providers and other parties). Prior
to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, including this _Article VI_ , complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



  

6.17 _Restructuring Efforts_. If Seller shall have failed to obtain
the Requisite Seller Vote at the duly convened Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof, then, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, each of the parties shall in good faith use its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction
provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall have any
obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the amount or kind
of the consideration to be issued to holders of Seller Common Stock as
provided for in this Agreement, in a manner adverse to such party) and/or
resubmit this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as
restructured pursuant to this _Section 6.17_ ) to Seller's shareholders for
approval.

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

6.18 _Takeover Laws_. No party shall take any action that would cause
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, as
applicable, and each party shall take all necessary steps within its control
to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable
Takeover Laws, as now or hereafter in effect, that purports to apply to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

6.19 _Section 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall take
such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions
of Seller equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of Seller to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

  



  

6.20 _Classified Loans_. Seller shall within twenty (20) days after
the end of each quarter after the date hereof and not later than two
(2) business days prior to the Closing Date provide Buyer with a complete and
accurate list, including the amount, of all Loans subject to each type of
classification of the Classified Loans.

  



  

6.21 _ESOP Matters_. Seller and Seller Bank shall take or cause to be
taken all such actions as may be necessary to effect the actions set forth
below relating to the ESOP prior to or simultaneous with the Closing, as
applicable. Effective at least five (5) business days before the Closing, the
ESOP shall be terminated (the " _ESOP Termination Date_ "). No new
participants shall be admitted on or after the ESOP Termination Date and all
existing ESOP participants' accounts shall become fully vested and 100% non-
forfeitable. Seller Bank shall direct the Trustee to remit a sufficient number
of the shares of Seller Common Stock allocated to the suspense account
pursuant to the ESOP (the " _Suspense Shares_ ") back to Seller to repay the
outstanding ESOP Loan in full, with each remitted share to be valued equal to
the Merger Consideration. All remaining shares of Seller Common Stock held by
the ESOP as of the Effective Time shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration. After repayment of the outstanding ESOP Loan and the exchange
of the shares of Seller Common Stock for the Merger Consideration, the cash
received upon conversion of the remaining Suspense Shares shall be deemed to
be earnings and shall be allocated as earnings to the accounts of the
ESOP participants who are employed as of the ESOP Termination Date based on
their account balances under the ESOP as of the ESOP Termination Date and
distributed to ESOP participants after the receipt of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS. No benefit distributions shall be made
from the ESOP without the prior written consent of Buyer before the IRS issues
a favorable determination letter with respect to the tax-qualified status of
the ESOP on termination, except that distributions from the ESOP may be made
earlier if required by law or upon the occurrence of the ESOP participant's
retirement, death, disability or termination of employment or any other
event, other than plan termination, that requires a distribution from the
ESOP. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller Bank shall take all such actions as
are necessary (determined in consultation with Buyer) to submit the
application for favorable determination letter in advance of the Closing, and
following the Closing, Buyer shall use its best efforts in good faith to
obtain such favorable determination letter as promptly as possible
(including, but not limited to, making such changes to the ESOP as may be
required by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable
determination letter). Seller Bank, and following the Effective Time, Buyer,
will adopt such amendments to the ESOP to effect the provisions of this
_Section 6.21_. Promptly following the receipt of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of the ESOP upon its
termination, the account balances in the ESOP shall either be distributed to
participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax-
qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a participant
or beneficiary may direct.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

6.22 _Coordination_.

  



  

(a) Buyer and Seller agree that as promptly as practicable following
the execution of this Agreement, meetings with employees of Seller Bank shall
be held at such locations as Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree; provided
that representatives of Seller shall be permitted to attend such meetings.
Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree as to the scope and content of all
communications from Buyer to the employees of Seller and Seller Bank. At
mutually agreed upon times following execution of this Agreement,
representatives of Buyer shall be permitted to meet with the employees of
Seller and Seller Bank to discuss employment opportunities with
Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer in this process shall have no
right to exercise any management authority over employees of Seller and
Seller Bank.

  



  

(b) From and after the first date on which both the Requisite Seller
Vote and Requisite Regulatory Approvals required under  _Section 7.1_ (and
without having to allow any waiting period under such approvals to expire)
have been obtained, Buyer shall be permitted to conduct training sessions
outside of normal business hours or at other times as Seller may agree with
the employees of Seller and Seller Bank and may conduct such training
seminars at such locations as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree;
provided that such meetings or trainings will be at no cost to Seller and
that Buyer will not schedule such training sessions in a manner which
interferes with Seller's and Seller Bank's normal business operations.

  



  

(c) Upon Buyer's reasonable request, and with Buyer's
indemnification, prior to the Closing Date and following receipt of both the
Requisite Seller Vote and Requisite Regulatory Approvals required under
_Section 7.1_ (and without having to allow any waiting period under such
approvals to expire), and consistent with GAAP and applicable banking laws and
regulations, each of Seller and its Subsidiaries shall give due consideration
to Buyer's request to (i) modify or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve,
tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including
loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis
that is consistent with that of Buyer and (ii) make such accruals under the
Seller Benefit Plans as Buyer may reasonably request to reflect the benefits
payable under such Seller Benefit Plans upon the completion of the Merger; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that at Seller's reasonable request no such changes
need be made earlier than one (1) business day prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(d) Upon Buyer's reasonable request, and with Buyer's
indemnification, prior to the Closing Date and following receipt of both the
Requisite Seller Vote and Requisite Regulatory Approvals required under
_Section 7.1_ (and without having to allow any waiting period under such
approvals to expire), and consistent with GAAP and subject to applicable
banking laws and regulations, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall give due
consideration to Buyer's request that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
divest itself prior to the Effective Time of such investment securities and
loans as are identified by Buyer in writing from time to time prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that no such divestitures need be
made prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(e) No accrual or reserve or change in policy or procedure, or any
divestiture of investment securities or loans, made by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries at the request of Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6.22_ shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other
provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether
any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The
recording of any such adjustment shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement
of previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be
construed as concurrence of Seller or its management with any such
adjustments. In the event the Merger is not consummated, Buyer shall
indemnify Seller for such actions within thirty (30) days.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

6.23 _Environmental Assessments_.

  



  

(a) Seller shall cooperate with and grant access to an environmental
consulting firm selected by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to Seller, during
normal business hours (and at such other times as may be agreed), to any real
property (including buildings or other structures) currently owned or
operated by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any Seller Loan Property for
the purpose of conducting (i) Phase I Assessments (which also may include an
evaluation of asbestos containing materials, polychlorinated biphenyls, lead
based paint, lead in drinking water, mold, and radon) and (ii) Phase II
Environmental Assessments, including subsurface investigation of soil, soil
vapor, and groundwater (" _Phase II Assessment_ "). Buyer and its
environmental consulting firm shall conduct all environmental assessments
pursuant to this _Section 6.24(a)_ at mutually agreeable times and so as to
eliminate or minimize to the greatest extent possible interference with
Seller's operation of its business, and Buyer shall maintain or cause to be
maintained reasonably adequate insurance with respect to any assessment
conducted. Buyer shall be required to restore each property to substantially
its pre-assessment condition. All costs and expenses incurred in connection
with any Phase I or Phase II Assessment and any restoration and clean up
shall be borne solely by Buyer.

  



  

(b) To the extent requested by Buyer, each environmental assessment
shall include an estimate by the environmental consulting firm preparing such
environmental assessment of the costs of investigation, monitoring, personal
injury, property damage, clean up, remediation, penalties, fines or other
liabilities, as the case may be, relating to the "potential environmental
condition(s)" or "recognized environmental condition(s)" or other conditions
which are the subject of the environmental assessment.

  



  

6.24 _Certain Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to: (a) timely file (taking into account any extensions of time
within which to file) all Tax Returns required to be filed by it and timely
pay all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns that are so filed;
(b) establish an accrual in its books and records and financial statements in
accordance with recent past practice for all Taxes payable by it for which a
Tax Return is due prior to the Effective Time; (c) terminate all Tax sharing
or similar agreements (other than such an arrangement or agreement
exclusively between or among Seller and its Subsidiaries) and all powers of
attorney with respect to or involving Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (such
that after the Closing, Buyer shall not be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder); and (d) promptly notify Buyer of any suit, claim, action,
investigation, proceeding or audit pending or threatened against or with
respect to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax matter,

this Agreement and (b) Buyer shall cause Merger Sub to accede to this
Agreement by executing a signature page to this Agreement. Before the

Regulatory Approval shall include or contain, nor shall any Governmental
Entity have indicated in writing that it will impose, any Materially
Burdensome Regulatory Condition.

  



  

(c) _Third Party Consents_. All consents or approvals of all persons
(other than Governmental Authorities) required for the consummation of the
Merger or the continued use and occupation of any Leased Real Property, or
that are required in order to prevent a breach of or a default under or a
termination of, or any right of acceleration of any liability under any of the
Leases shall have been obtained and shall be in full force and effect, unless
the failure to obtain any such consent or approval would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Seller.

  



  

(d) _Other Actions_. Seller shall have furnished Buyer with such
certificates of its officers or others and such other documents to evidence
fulfillment of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ as Buyer
may reasonably request.

  



  

7.3 _Conditions to the Obligations of Seller and Seller Bank_. The
obligation of Seller and Seller Bank to consummate the Merger is also
conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver by Buyer, at or prior to the
Effective Time, of each of the following conditions: (a) each of the
representations and warranties of Buyer contained herein shall be true and
correct as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date with the same effect
as though all such representations and warranties had been made on the
Closing Date, except for any such representations and warranties made as of a
specified date, which shall be true and correct as of such date, in any case
subject to the standard set forth in _Section 4.1(b)_ ; (b) each and all of
the agreements and covenants of Buyer to be performed and complied with
pursuant to this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date shall have been
duly performed and complied with in all material respects. Seller shall have
received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, signed by the President and
Chief Executive Officer of Buyer, to the effect that the conditions set forth
in this _Section 7.3_ have been satisfied; (c) Buyer shall have delivered
the Merger Consideration to the Paying Agent not less than one (1) business
day prior to the Closing Date and the Paying Agent shall provide Seller with
a certificate evidencing such delivery; and (d) Buyer shall have furnished to
Seller with such certificates of its officers or others and such other
documents to evidence fulfillment of the conditions set forth in this
_Section 7.3_ as Seller may reasonably request.

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither Buyer nor Seller
may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in  _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_
, or _7.3_ , to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's
failure to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger, as required
by and subject to conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII

  

TERMINATION

  



  

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the receipt of the
Requisite Seller Vote:

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

  



  

(b) by either Buyer or Seller if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such denial has
become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order, injunction,
decree or other legal restraint or prohibition permanently enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless the failure to
obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

  



  

(c) by either Buyer or Seller if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before July 31, 2020 (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless
the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

  



  

(d) by either Buyer or Seller (provided, that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, obligation,
covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a
breach of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements or any of the
representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall
cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of Seller, in the
case of a termination by Buyer, or Buyer, in the case of a termination by
Seller, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the
aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such
representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 7.2_ , in the case of a termination by Buyer, or _Section 7.3_ , in
the case of a termination by Seller, and which is not cured within forty-five
(45) days following written notice to Seller, in the case of a termination by
Buyer, or Buyer, in the case of a termination by Seller, or by its nature or
timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior
to the Termination Date);

  



  

(e) by Buyer or Seller, if the Requisite Seller Vote shall not have
been obtained, except to the extent that the failure to obtain the Requisite
Seller Vote shall be due to Seller's or any of its Subsidiaries' material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein (which has not been cured) relating to the Meeting or the receipt of
the Requisite Seller Vote;

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

(f) by Buyer, prior to the time the Requisite Seller Vote is
obtained, if Seller or the Board of Directors of Seller shall have (i) failed
to make the Recommendation or failed to include the Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified the Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Buyer, or resolved to do so or failed to reaffirm such
recommendation within two (2) business days after Buyer requests in writing
that such action be taken, (ii) failed to recommend against acceptance of any
publicly disclosed tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of
Seller Common Stock by any person (other than Buyer or any affiliate of
Buyer), within the ten (10) business day period commencing on the date such
tender offer or exchange offer is first publicly disclosed, in any such case
whether or not permitted by the terms hereof, (iii) recommended or endorsed an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) breached any of its obligations under _Sections
6.3_ or _6.13_ in any material respect

  



  

(g) by Seller, if at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to obtaining the Requisite Seller Vote, Seller receives an Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ unless it satisfies each of the
following conditions:

  



  

(i) Seller shall have complied with _Section 6.13_ of this
Agreement, including the conclusion by the Board of Directors of Seller in
good faith that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(ii) the Board of Directors of Seller has adopted the definitive
agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal and has authorized and
directed Seller and Seller Bank to enter into that agreement; and

  



  

(iii) Seller concurrently pays the Termination Fee payable pursuant
to _Section 8.2(b)_.

  



  

8.2 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

  



  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Buyer or
Seller as provided in _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Buyer, Seller, any of their respective
affiliates or any of their respective employees, officers, directors or
representatives shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder,
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i)
_Section 6.2(c)_ and this _Section 8.2_ and _Article IX_  shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor Seller shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud
or any knowing, intentional and material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event that after the execution of this Agreement (i) prior
to the termination of this Agreement, a _bona fide_  Acquisition Proposal
shall have been made known to senior management or the Board of Directors of
Seller or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any
person shall have publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal or the intention
to make an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) with respect to
Seller, (ii) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by (A) either Buyer or
Seller pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ and the Requisite Seller Vote has not
been obtained, or (B) Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ solely in the case
of a willful breach by Seller, or (C) Buyer or Seller pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_, and (iii) on or prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after
the date of such termination, Seller enters into a definitive agreement
(regardless of whether a transaction is consummated) or consummates a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to in clause (b)(i) above), then Seller
shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement or
the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Buyer, by wire transfer of
same day funds, an amount in cash equal to $4,440,000 (the " _Termination Fee_
").

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant
to _Section 8.1(f)_ or by Seller pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ , then Seller
shall pay Buyer, by wire transfer of same day funds, an amount in cash equal
to the Termination Fee on the date of such termination.

  



  

(d) 

  



  

(i) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by Seller
pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ and (B) Seller made an Adverse Recommendation
Change prior to such termination, then Seller shall, on the date of
termination, pay Buyer, by wire transfer of same day funds, an amount in cash
equal to the Termination Fee; or

  



  

(ii) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by Seller
pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ , (B) Seller did not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change prior to such termination and (C) on or prior to the
date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Seller
enters into a definitive agreement (regardless of whether a transaction is
consummated) or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to in
_Section 8.1(g)_ above), then Seller shall, on the earlier of the date it
enters into such definitive agreement or the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Buyer, by wire transfer of same day funds, an amount in cash
equal to the Termination Fee.

  



  

(e) Any payment of the Termination Fee required to be made pursuant
to this _Section 8.2_ shall be made not more than two (2) business days
after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such
payment. All payments under this _Section 8.2(e)_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer. The
payment of the Termination Fee by Seller pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ , _(c)_
, and _(d)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller, Seller Bank,
Buyer and Merger Sub in connection with the termination of this Agreement
under the circumstances described thereunder. However, nothing in this
Agreement shall in any way limit the right of Buyer or Seller to seek damages,
specific performance, or any remedy at law or in equity arising out of a
willful or material breach of, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement by
the other party hereto.

  



  

(f) Each of Buyer, Seller and Seller Bank acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of this
Agreement, (ii) without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into this
Agreement and (iii) the Termination Fee constitutes liquidated damages and
not a penalty. Accordingly, if Seller fails promptly to pay the amount due
pursuant to this  _Section 8.2_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer
commences a suit which results in a judgment against Seller for the
Termination Fee, as applicable, Seller shall pay the costs and expenses of
Buyer (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit. In addition, if Seller fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to
this _Section 8.2_ when due, then Seller shall pay interest on such overdue
amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as reported in _The
Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative
source) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made
for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid.

ARTICLE IX 
 MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

9.1 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after

requires such further approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the

agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance

any provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the

9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

9.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

9.9 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall
be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Rhode Island, without regard to the conflict of law principles thereof (except
that matters under the Agreement relating to fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of Seller shall be determined in accordance with the laws of
the State of Maryland). Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to and
submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District
Court for the District of Rhode Island or any state court sitting in the State
of Rhode Island in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that
all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such court, and (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense or
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought
and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any
other party with respect thereto. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
any party hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a
copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in
the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 9.5_. Nothing in
this _Section 9.9_, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

  



  

9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE
TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT:
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.10_.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

9.11 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned
by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party. Any purported
assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section 6.7_ , this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are
for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations
and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance
herewith without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances,
the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  



  

9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur for which there is no adequate remedy at law in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party
shall be entitled to seek (a) a decree or order of specific performance to
enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b)
an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security or bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equity
level.

  



  

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  



  

9.14 _Confidential Supervisory Information_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no disclosure, representation or warranty shall
be made (or other action taken) pursuant to this Agreement that would involve
the disclosure of confidential supervisory information (including
confidential supervisory information as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 261.2(c) and as
identified in 12 C.F.R. § 309.5(g)(8)) of a Governmental Entity by any party
to this Agreement to the extent prohibited by applicable law. To the extent
legally permissible, appropriate substitute disclosures or actions shall be
made or taken under circumstances in which the limitations of the preceding
sentence apply.

  



  

9.15 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This
Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection
with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the
extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any
amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or
e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of
a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
