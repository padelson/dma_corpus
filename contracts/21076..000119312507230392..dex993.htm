Natural Personal Care </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 31, 2007 &#150; The Clorox Company (NYSE: CLX), as part of its strategy to grow in and beyond its core in
fast-growing, higher-margin consumer-product categories, today announced it will acquire Burt&#146;s Bees, a leader in the natural personal care category. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px;padding-bottom:3px;line-Height:95%; vertical-align:top"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The highly fragmented U.S. natural personal care market represents about $6.4 billion in sales and is currently
growing at about 9 percent annually. Founded in 1984, the Burt&#146;s Bees<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1"><SUP>&reg;</SUP></FONT> brand today is regarded among many consumers who purchase natural personal care products as the &#147;most
natural&#148; personal care brand and as the leading natural brand in the U.S. The acquisition of Burt&#146;s Bees is strongly aligned with Clorox&#146;s Centennial Strategy to pursue growth in areas aligned with consumer &#147;megatrends&#148; in
health and wellness, sustainability, convenience and a more multicultural marketplace. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px;padding-bottom:3px;line-Height:95%; vertical-align:top"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;This
acquisition allows us to enter a growing market that&#146;s consistent with consumer megatrends,&#148; said Clorox Chairman and CEO Donald R. Knauss. &#147;With this transaction, we&#146;re entering into a new strategic phase for our company,
enabling us to expand further into the natural/sustainable business platform. The Burt&#146;s Bees<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1"><SUP>&reg;</SUP></FONT> brand is well-anchored in sustainability and health and wellness, and we believe it will
benefit from natural and &#147;green&#148; tailwinds. It&#146;s in an economically attractive category with a margin structure that will be highly accretive to Clorox. Combined with our new Green Works&#153; line of natural cleaning products, and
Brita<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1"><SUP>&reg;</SUP></FONT> water-filtration products, we can leverage Burt&#146;s Bees&#146; extensive capabilities and credibility to build a robust, higher-growth platform for Clorox.&#148; </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Beth Springer, Clorox&#146;s executive vice president &#150; Strategy&nbsp;&amp; Growth, who will oversee the business, said, &#147;Burt&#146;s Bees is a compelling
strategic fit for us, and we believe we can expand on its strong trends over time to build even greater value. Burt&#146;s Bees has a highly effective strategy and plan, strong trade practices and organizational capabilities, and a robust culture
and <I>esprit de corps</I> that we want to leverage and protect. We strongly believe Clorox&#146;s deep capabilities to drive demand creation through consumer communication and value-creating customer capabilities, coupled with Burt&#146;s
Bees&#146; strong heritage of innovation to delight consumers, create a right to win. We&#146;re delighted Burt&#146;s Bees president and CEO, John Replogle, will continue to lead the company, which will continue to be based in North Carolina.&#148;
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;I&#146;m delighted we&#146;re entering into this partnership with Clorox and that I will be part of this exciting next step for Burt&#146;s
Bees,&#148; said John Replogle. &#147;The Clorox Company and Burt&#146;s Bees have complementary values, visions and strengths. Together, I believe Clorox and Burt&#146;s Bees can help this business realize its full potential.&#148; </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;Burt&#146;s Bees&#146; mission &#145;<I>we make people&#146;s lives better every day &#151; naturally&#146;</I> is a terrific complement to Clorox&#146;s mission
&#145;<I>we make everyday life better, every day</I>,&#146;&#148; Springer said. &#147;Burt&#146;s Bees&#146; values align strongly with Clorox&#146;s and provide a solid foundation for working together and creating synergies between our management
teams.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>Terms of Deal and Financial Impact </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Under
the terms of the agreement, Clorox will acquire 100 percent of Burt&#146;s Bees from its stockholders in a transaction that is structured as a merger. The company is acquiring Burt&#146;s Bees for $925 million net of an additional $25 million
payment for anticipated tax benefits. Clorox will fund the all-cash transaction through a combination of cash and short-term borrowings. The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of this calendar year, is subject to regulatory approval.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px;padding-bottom:3px;line-Height:95%; vertical-align:top"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Commenting on the transaction, Clorox senior vice president and CFO Dan Heinrich said,
&#147;Burt&#146;s Bees is poised to capitalize on expanded distribution within the U.S. and other countries in which the Burt&#146;s Bees<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1"><SUP>&reg;</SUP></FONT> brand is currently marketed. The business is
enjoying strong distribution trends. We believe we can add value and expand these trends over time through our strong customer capabilities, while maintaining Burt&#146;s Bees&#146; higher margins. </FONT></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We see potential for expanding the brand into adjacencies, and we believe international expansion may offer significant
upside potential beyond our valuation.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Based on its current growth trajectory and estimated 2007 net customer sales of about $170 million,
Burt&#146;s Bees is anticipated to add nearly 2 points of top-line growth to Clorox in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Including estimates of
purchase-accounting adjustments and one-time transaction and integration costs related to the transaction, the company anticipates that the transaction will dilute its fiscal year 2008 earnings by about 10-15 cents per diluted share and that it will
be slightly accretive in fiscal year 2009. Excluding such purchase-accounting adjustments, one-time transaction and integration costs as well as non-cash expenses related to the transaction, the earnings per share impact is anticipated to be neutral
in fiscal year 2008 and solidly accretive in fiscal year 2009. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Lehman Brothers acted as sole financial advisor to The Clorox Company. Goldman Sachs was
financial advisor to Burt&#146;s Bees. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>For More Information </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
