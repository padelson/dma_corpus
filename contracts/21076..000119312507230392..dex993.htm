Clorox to Acquire Burts Bees; Expands Into Fast-Growing Natural Personal
Care

OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 31, 2007  The Clorox Company (NYSE: CLX), as part of
its strategy to grow in and beyond its core in fast-growing, higher-margin
consumer-product categories, today announced it will acquire Burts Bees, a
leader in the natural personal care category.

The highly fragmented U.S. natural personal care market represents about $6.4
billion in sales and is currently growing at about 9 percent annually.
Founded in 1984, the Burts Bees® brand today is regarded among many consumers
who purchase natural personal care products as the "most natural" personal
care brand and as the leading natural brand in the U.S. The acquisition of
Burts Bees is strongly aligned with Cloroxs Centennial Strategy to pursue
growth in areas aligned with consumer "megatrends" in health and wellness,
sustainability, convenience and a more multicultural marketplace.

"This acquisition allows us to enter a growing market thats consistent with
consumer megatrends," said Clorox Chairman and CEO Donald R. Knauss. "With
this transaction, were entering into a new strategic phase for our
company, enabling us to expand further into the natural/sustainable business
platform. The Burts Bees® brand is well-anchored in sustainability and health
and wellness, and we believe it will benefit from natural and "green"
tailwinds. Its in an economically attractive category with a margin structure
that will be highly accretive to Clorox. Combined with our new Green Works
line of natural cleaning products, and Brita® water-filtration products, we
can leverage Burts Bees extensive capabilities and credibility to build a
robust, higher-growth platform for Clorox."

Beth Springer, Cloroxs executive vice president  Strategy and Growth, who will
oversee the business, said, "Burts Bees is a compelling strategic fit for
us, and we believe we can expand on its strong trends over time to build even
greater value. Burts Bees has a highly effective strategy and plan, strong
trade practices and organizational capabilities, and a robust culture and
_esprit de corps_ that we want to leverage and protect. We strongly believe
Cloroxs deep capabilities to drive demand creation through consumer
communication and value-creating customer capabilities, coupled with
Burts Bees strong heritage of innovation to delight consumers, create a
right to win. Were delighted Burts Bees president and CEO, John Replogle,
will continue to lead the company, which will continue to be based in North
Carolina." 

"Im delighted were entering into this partnership with Clorox and that I
will be part of this exciting next step for Burts Bees," said John Replogle.
"The Clorox Company and Burts Bees have complementary values, visions and
strengths. Together, I believe Clorox and Burts Bees can help this business
realize its full potential."

"Burts Bees mission  _we make people s lives better every day 
naturally_ is a terrific complement to Cloroxs mission  _we make everyday
life better, every day_ ," Springer said. "Burts Bees values align strongly
with Cloroxs and provide a solid foundation for working together and creating
synergies between our management teams."

Terms of Deal and Financial Impact

Under the terms of the agreement, Clorox will acquire 100 percent of Burts
Bees from its stockholders in a transaction that is structured as a merger.
The company is acquiring Burts Bees for $925 million net of an additional $25
million payment for anticipated tax benefits. Clorox will fund the all-cash
transaction through a combination of cash and short-term borrowings. The
transaction, which is expected to close by the end of this calendar year, is
subject to regulatory approval. 

Commenting on the transaction, Clorox senior vice president and CFO Dan
Heinrich said, "Burts Bees is poised to capitalize on expanded distribution
within the U.S. and other countries in which the Burts Bees® brand is
currently marketed. The business is enjoying strong distribution trends. We
believe we can add value and expand these trends over time through our strong
customer capabilities, while maintaining Burts Bees higher margins. We see potential for expanding the brand into adjacencies, and we believe
international expansion may offer significant upside potential beyond our
valuation."

Based on its current growth trajectory and estimated 2007 net customer sales
of about $170 million, Burts Bees is anticipated to add nearly 2 points of
top-line growth to Clorox in fiscal years 2008 and 2009.

Including estimates of purchase-accounting adjustments and one-time
transaction and integration costs related to the transaction, the company
anticipates that the transaction will dilute its fiscal year 2008 earnings by
about 10-15 cents per diluted share and that it will be slightly accretive in
fiscal year 2009. Excluding such purchase-accounting adjustments, one-time
transaction and integration costs as well as non-cash expenses related to the
transaction, the earnings per share impact is anticipated to be neutral in
fiscal year 2008 and solidly accretive in fiscal year 2009.

Lehman Brothers acted as sole financial advisor to The Clorox Company. Goldman
Sachs was financial advisor to Burts Bees.
