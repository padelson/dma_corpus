ARTICLE 1

  

 _Purchase and Sale of Assets_

  

 1.1 _ Purchase and Sale of Assets._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, and based on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, Seller hereby sells, conveys, transfers, assigns and delivers to Buyer, free and clear of Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and free and clear of all Retained Liabilities, and Buyer hereby purchases from Seller, all of the assets, properties and rights of Seller (i) that are listed on _Exhibit A_, (ii) that are located at, or, within the past twelve months have been rented from or used at, any of the locations listed on the _Real Property Schedule_ , (iii) that are intangible assets identified on the _Intellectual Property Schedule_ , (iv) that are parts and supplies used in the Business and (v) that are other miscellaneous items that are primarily used in the Business (collectively, the " _Acquired Assets_ "). The Acquired Assets also include without limitation the Assumed Contracts. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Acquired Assets shall not include those assets, properties or rights described on _Exhibit B _to this Agreement (collectively, the " _Excluded Assets_ "). 

  

 1.2 _ Consideration for Purchase and Sale._ As consideration for the purchase and sale of the Acquired Assets, Buyer hereby delivers to Seller $114,340,000 (the " _Closing Payment_ "), by wire transfer of immediately-available funds to the account(s) previously designated in writing by Seller to Buyer. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that the amount of the Closing Payment has been reduced by $160,000,   

 representing the amount of certain bonuses that are to be paid by Buyer to
certain employees of Seller pursuant to the Key Employee Agreements.

  

 1.3 _ Buyer\'s Assumption of Liabilities and Contracts._ Seller hereby assigns and Buyer hereby assumes only the liabilities and obligations of Seller that arise after the Closing Date under the contracts expressly listed on _Exhibit C_ (collectively, the " _Assumed Contracts_ " and such liabilities and obligations, the " _Assumed Liabilities_ "), and no other liabilities or contracts whatsoever for which Seller is liable or by which Seller, any other person or entity or the Acquired Assets are bound as of the date hereof. 

  

 1.4 _ Seller\'s Retention of Liabilities._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall not assume, succeed to, be liable for, be subject to, or be obligated for, nor shall the Acquired Assets be subject to any liabilities, claims, contracts or obligations of any nature whatsoever, whether known, unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise that Seller is, or could become, subject to or liable for (the " _Retained Liabilities_ "), other than the obligations under the Assumed Contracts that arise after the Closing Date. 

   

 The Retained Liabilities are all liabilities, claims and obligations of any nature whatsoever that are not specifically assumed by Buyer under this Agreement, including without limitation all liabilities, claims and obligations arising from or based on contract, breach of contract, warranty, tort, strict liability, the design, manufacture or distribution of products (including without limitation products liability), employment, Environmental Claims, Taxes, the Supply Agreement, law, violation of law, the transfer of the Acquired Assets, or the operation of the Business prior to the date hereof. Notwithstanding Buyer\'s assumption of the Assumed Contracts, the Retained Liabilities shall include any liabilities, claims or obligations based on Seller\'s breach or nonperformance of, or misrepresentation under, any Assumed Contract prior to the date hereof. 

  

 1.5 _ Post-Closing Audit; Second Payment._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Audit Procedures._ As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall commence an audit of the Acquired Assets, together with such further analysis and review of the Acquired Assets, and related books and records of the Business, as Buyer shall deem reasonably necessary (the " _Post-Closing Audit_ "). Seller and its affiliates shall cooperate with Buyer in connection with the Post-Closing Audit. Buyer shall complete the Post-Closing Audit and shall reasonably determine the amounts, if any, of any Equipment Adjustment, Inventory Adjustment, Tax Adjustment and Indebtedness Adjustment on or before the 150th day after the Closing Date. Upon completion of the Post-Closing Audit and the determination of the applicable Equipment Adjustment, Inventory Adjustment, Tax Adjustment and Indebtedness Adjustment, Buyer shall deliver a written notice (the " _Adjustment Notice_ ") to Seller of the amount of the Second Payment and the respective amounts of the Equipment Adjustment, Inventory Adjustment, Tax Adjustment and Indebtedness Adjustment (the sum of such adjustments being referred to in this Agreement as the " _Adjustments_ ") and briefly describing the basis for such Adjustments. 

   

 (b) _ Objection Notice._ Seller may reasonably object to all or any portion of the Adjustments by delivering written notice (the " _Objection Notice_ ") to Buyer not later than 30 days after receipt of the Adjustment Notice. The Objection Notice must be timely, must identify each amount of the Equipment Adjustment, the Inventory Adjustment, the Tax Adjustment and the Indebtedness Adjustment to which Seller objects and must briefly describe the basis for such objection (such disputed amounts being referred to herein as the " _Disputed Amounts_ "). Any portion of the Adjustments not specifically identified and objected to on a timely basis in the Objection Notice shall be deemed final and binding on the parties hereto. 

   

 (c) _ Disputed Amounts._ After Buyer receives the Objection Notice, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve their disagreements about the Disputed Amounts. 

  

    
  

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 1.5(c)_, if Buyer
and Seller have not resolved all their disagreements regarding the Disputed
Amounts by the 15th day after Buyer\'s receipt of the Objection Notice, then
either Buyer or Seller may submit such disagreements to resolution pursuant to
_Section 1.5(f)_ and Buyer\'s obligation to pay the Second Payment shall be
suspended until the Disputed Amounts are finally resolved either by agreement
between Buyer and Seller or by arbitration pursuant to _Section 1.5(f)_;
_provided, however_ , that if the aggregate amount of the Adjustments (as set
forth in the Adjustment Notice) is less than $1,000,000, then Buyer shall pay
to Seller an amount equal to (x) $1,000,000 _minus_ (y) the aggregate amount
of the Adjustments (as set forth in the Adjustment Notice), in partial payment
of the Second Payment not later than the 5th day after Buyer\'s receipt of
the Objection Notice; _provided, further_ , that such payment shall be
credited against Buyer\'s obligation to pay the Second Payment when the
disagreements regarding the Disputed Amounts finally are resolved and the
remainder of the Second Payment (if any) is paid. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the arbitrator may not in any arbitration
of any disagreement over the Disputed Amounts determine that the amount of the
Adjustments shall be less than the excess of the aggregate amount of the
Adjustments (as set forth in the Adjustment Notice) over the aggregate amount
of the Disputed Amounts (as set forth in the Objection Notice).

  

 (d) _ No Objection By Company._ If Seller does not timely deliver an Objection Notice to Buyer, then Buyer shall pay the Second Payment to the Seller not later than the tenth business day after the expiration of the time period during which Seller may deliver an Objection Notice pursuant to _Section 1.5(b)_ and the amount of the Second Payment shall be the amount reflected as such in the Adjustment Notice. If Seller timely delivers an Objection Notice to Buyer, then Buyer shall pay the Second Payment to Seller on or before the tenth business day after the resolution of all disagreements regarding the Disputed Amounts either by agreement by Buyer and Seller or pursuant to _Section 1.5(f)_ and the amount of the Second Payment shall reflect such agreement or arbitration determination. The date on which the Second Payment is made is referred to herein as the " _Second Payment Date_."

All repair costs included in the calculation of the Equipment Adjustment shall be based on actual costs and expenditures (if known by Buyer) or good faith estimates by Buyer of parts expense and internal and external hourly labor charges, in each case as are incurred to return such equipment to Rental Ready condition.

 (vi) Buyer and Seller shall not disclose the existence or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all other applicable parties; nor will any party hereto disclose to any third party any confidential information disclosed by any other party hereto in the course of an arbitration proceeding hereunder without the prior written consent of such other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that Buyer and Seller may disclose the existence or results of an arbitration hereunder, as well as information otherwise required to be disclosed by deposition, subpoena or other court or governmental action in connection with their respective obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and in connection with their registration of offerings of securities under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or in connection with their obligations under any other applicable law. 

   

  

 1.6 _ Allocation of Purchase Price._ The parties to this Agreement shall allocate the purchase price in accordance with Buyer\'s written schedule which will be submitted to Seller by Buyer as soon as practicable. Within ninety (90) days following the date hereof, Seller and Buyer shall prepare jointly Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, _Asset Acquisition Statement Under Section 1060_ (" _Form 8594_"), in conformity with Buyer\'s written schedule. For the purpose of preparing such schedule, Buyer shall assign a value to each tangible Acquired Asset equal to the replacement cost of such asset based upon practices in the Business industry. Buyer and Seller shall attach such Form 8594 to their respective tax returns for the 2002 tax year, and to the extent that the purchase price is adjusted, revise and amend the allocation schedule and Form 8594 as necessary.

 1.8 _ Prorations._ For taxable periods that begin before and end after the Closing Date, ad valorem and similar taxes and assessments relating to the Acquired Assets shall be prorated between Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, as of the Closing Date based upon estimates of the amount of such taxes and assessments that are due and payable on the Acquired Assets during the year during which the Closing Date occurs. As soon as the amount of such actual taxes and assessments is known, Seller and Buyer shall reassess the amounts to be paid by each party with the result that Seller shall be liable for those such taxes and assessments attributable to the time period up to and including the Closing Date (the " _Seller Prorated Taxes_ ") and Buyer shall be liable for and pay for those such taxes and assessments attributable to the period thereafter calculated based on the number of days in the tax period ending on or before the Closing Date and the number of days in the tax period ending after the Closing Date (as the case may be) as compared to the total number of days in the tax period. If Buyer delivers to Seller its computation of Seller Prorated Taxes at least 30 days prior to the Second Payment Date, Buyer may elect to pay the Seller Prorated Taxes on behalf of Seller by withholding the amount of the Seller Prorated Taxes from the Second Payment and promptly delivering such amount to the applicable tax authorities. 

  

 1.9 _ Unassignable Contracts._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Acquired Asset or any right thereunder if an attempted assignment, without the consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or in any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer or Seller thereunder. If such consent is not obtained, Seller and Buyer will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that this _Section 1.9_ shall not affect Buyer\'s right to indemnification hereunder for any Breach.

 (c) _ No Conflict._ Except as set forth on the _Conflicts Schedule_ , neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the Related Agreements, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (i) result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under any Assumed Contract, (ii) give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a benefit under any Assumed Contract, (iii) result in the creation of any Lien upon any Acquired Asset, (iv) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of the limited partnership agreement or organizational documents of the Seller, or (v) conflict with or violate any Order or Legal Requirement.

 3.3 _ Assets._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Personal Property._ 

    

 (i) _Title_. Seller is the sole owner of the assets reflected in the Financial Statements and has good and marketable title to all Acquired Assets that are personalty (the " _Personal Property_ ") (other than the leased Personal Property described below), in each case free and clear of all Liens, except for (A) all defects, exceptions, restrictions, easements, rights of way, and encumbrances disclosed on the _Personal Property Schedule_ , (B) any interest or title of any lessor in any real or personal property pursuant to a lease, (C) liens for non-delinquent taxes and assessments, and (D) inchoate liens of lessors or bailees arising under statute (" _Permitted Liens_ "). For purposes hereof, " _Liens_ " shall mean security interests, liens (choate or inchoate), encumbrances, mortgages, pledges, equities, charges, assessments, easements, covenants, restrictions, reservations, defects in title, encroachments and other burdens or changes, whether arising by contract or under law, other than inchoate statutory liens for amounts not yet payable. With respect to any Personal Property that is leased, Seller is in compliance with each such lease and is the sole holder of a valid and subsisting leasehold interest, free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Liens. The _Personal Property Schedule_ lists each lease agreement, service agreement or other agreement related to each item of leased Personal Property having an original cost in excess of $15,000 (the " _Equipment Leases_ "). The Acquired Assets are not subject to, and the Business is not dependent upon, any capital lease obligations or similar arrangements. 

  

 A list of all items of furniture, furnishings, machinery, automobiles, trucks, spare parts, supplies, rental and other equipment and other tangible personal property owned or leased by Seller as of May 31, 2002 that are Acquired Assets (collectively, the " _Equipment_ ") (but excluding office equipment used in Seller\'s conduct of its business and not reflected on Seller\'s internal asset lists, and excluding office supplies) is set forth on _Exhibit A_. Except for those items sold or acquired by Seller in the ordinary course of conducting the Business since May 31, 2002, the list of Equipment and other information set forth on _Exhibit A_ is true, 

   

     
  

 complete and accurate as of the Closing Date. For each item of Equipment
with an original cost equal to or greater than $2,000, _Exhibit A_ includes
a brief description, original cost and net book value of each item and also
identifies whether such item of Equipment is owned or leased by Seller. For
each item of Equipment with an original cost less than $2,000, _Exhibit A_
includes a brief description of each category and the actual quantity of such
item (or an estimate if the Seller does not ordinarily maintain a specific
count of such items). Each item of Equipment with an original cost equal to or
greater than $2,000 owned or leased by Seller is merchantable, fit for
the purpose for which it was procured, is usable in the ordinary course of
the Seller\'s Business and is in conformity with all applicable laws, rules
and regulations.

  

 (ii) _Inventory_. The inventory of parts and supplies held for use in the Business as of the Closing Date and as reflected on the Financial Statements (the " _Inventory_ ") has been maintained at ordinary and customary levels for the Business done or expected to be done. Except as set forth on the _Inventory Schedule_ , all Inventory is located at the Leased Premises or on service vehicles of Seller. 

  

 (iii) _Facilities_. Except as set forth on the _Facilities and Equipment Schedule_ , all buildings, facilities, offices, improvements on real estate, or other properties, owned or leased by Seller for the conduct of the Business have been maintained in accordance with practices that are standard for the Business industry, and are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

   

 (iv) _Equipment_. Except as set forth on the _Facilities and Equipment Schedule_ , all tools, fixtures and computer hardware and software that are Acquired Assets with an original cost equal to or greater than $1,000, whether owned or leased, have been maintained in accordance with manufacturer specifications that are standard for the Business industry, and are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

  

 (v) _Personal Property Taxes_. There are no disputes or appeals pending regarding the amount of the Taxes on, or the assessed valuation of, the Personal Property, and no special arrangements or agreements exist with any governmental authority with respect thereto (the representations and warranties contained in this paragraph (v) shall not be deemed to be breached by any prospective general increase in personal property tax rates). There is no tax assessment (in addition to the normal, annual general personal property tax assessment) pending or, to the best of Seller\'s knowledge, threatened with respect to any portion of the Personal Property, or to the extent Seller is liable for payment therefore. 

    

 (b) _ Real Property._ 

    

 (i) _Fee Simple_. The Acquired Assets do not include and the Business is not dependent upon any real property owned by Seller or any of its Affiliates. 

  

 (ii) _Leases; Easements and Other Interests_. The _Real Property Schedule_ sets forth (A) a description of the land, premises, buildings, structures and improvements covered by each lease of real property that constitutes part of the Acquired Assets, (B) a list of all other contracts and instruments, whether or not in writing, relating to or affecting real property used in the conduct of the Business or any interest therein to which Seller is a party or (1) by which the Acquired Assets are bound or affected (including without limitation any such contract or instrument that is an option or other contractual right to purchase, acquire, sell, assign or dispose of any interest in any real property) or (2) upon which the Business or the Acquired Assets are dependant. The interests described in items (A) and (B) above are collectively referred to herein as the " _Leased Premises_ " and the leases, easements, concessions, contracts and instruments described in items (A) and (B) above are referred to herein as the " _Real Estate Contracts_." All locations where Seller and its Affiliates engaged in renting, selling 

   

     
  

 and servicing trench shoring equipment (including hydraulic shoring
equipment), trench shielding equipment, trench safety equipment, road plates,
lasers, confined space technology (including gas monitors and blowers), slide
rail products, sheet pile products and beam and plate products and related
parts and supplies are listed on the _Real Property Schedule_.

   

  

 Seller is the sole holder of valid and subsisting leasehold interests in the Leased Premises leased thereby free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Liens. All lease or rental payments and other amounts due and payable in connection with the Real Estate Contracts are current, there are no defaults by Seller with respect thereto and no event has occurred that would with the passing of time or the giving of notice or both constitute a default thereunder. All options in favor of Seller to purchase any of the Leased Premises, if any, are in full force and effect. The Seller has the right to quiet enjoyment of the Leased Premises for the full term of the related Real Estate Contract and any renewal option related thereto, and no leasehold or other interest of Seller in such Leased Premises is subject to or subordinate to any Lien, whether or not the same renders the lease unmarketable, except as specifically set forth in the _Real Property Schedule_. 

  

 The Real Estate Contracts are legally valid and binding and in full force and effect, and there are no defaults thereunder. None of the rights of the Seller under any Real Estate Contract will be impaired by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Related Agreements, and all of such rights will be enforceable by Buyer after the Closing Date without the consent or agreement of any other party, except for consents and agreements described in the _Real Property Schedule_. 

  

   

 (iii) _Ingress and Egress; Eminent Domain_. Seller has all easements and rights of ingress and egress necessary for utilities and services and for all operations of the Business in the manner and to the extent previously conducted by it. Neither the whole nor any portion of any Leased Premises constituting part of the Acquired Assets or used in the conduct of the Business, has been condemned, taken by right of eminent domain, requisitioned or otherwise taken by any public authority, and no such condemnation, taking by right of eminent domain, requisition or taking is, to Seller\'s knowledge, threatened or contemplated, and Seller has not received, nor knows of, any notice regarding any such action. 

   

 (iv) _Improvements_. None of the improvements comprising the Leased Premises, or the businesses conducted by Seller thereon, are (A) in violation of any building line or use or occupancy restriction, limitation, condition or covenant of record or any zoning or building law, code or ordinance or public utility or other easement or (B) encroaches on the property rights of any other person or entity. Each facility located on the Leased Premises currently is served by gas, electricity, water, sewage and waste disposal and rail and other utilities adequate to operate such facility, and none of the utility companies serving any such facility has threatened Seller with any reduction in service. All of said utilities are installed and operating and all installation and connection charges have been paid for in full. The continued maintenance and operation of the Leased Premises as currently maintained and operated is not dependent on facilities located at other properties, and the continued maintenance and operation of any other property is not dependent on facilities located on the Leased Premises. To Seller\'s knowledge no building or other improvement on the Leased Premises relies on any property not included within the Leased Premises to fulfill any governmental requirement. 

  

 (v) _Real Property Taxes_. There are no disputes or appeals pending regarding the amount of the Taxes on, or the assessed valuation of, the Leased Premises, and no special arrangements or agreements exist with any governmental authority with respect thereto (the representations and warranties contained in this paragraph (v) shall not be deemed to be breached by any prospective general increase in real estate tax rates). There is no tax assessment (other than the normal, annual general real estate tax assessment) pending or, to

If any court determines that any portion of the Restrictive Covenants is invalid, the remaining portions shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid portion. If any court determines that any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, is unenforceable because of the duration or geographic scope of such provision, such court shall reduce the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to render it enforceable and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforced. 

  

 (iv) _Enforceability in Jurisdiction_.

Thereafter, Buyer shall not use any NES Marks in connection with the sale of any products or services or otherwise in conduct of their business. If the Buyer breaches this _Section 5.5_,  Seller shall be entitled to specific performance and other injunctive relief against violations and any other remedies available at law or in equity.

   ARTICLE 6

  

 _Indemnification_

  

 6.1 _ Survival; Etc._ 

  

  

 (a) _ No Effect on Liability._ None of (i) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Related Agreements, or (ii) any investigation or disclosure (other than in Disclosure Schedules with regard solely to the representations and warranties with respect to which such Disclosure Schedule information relates) that any party makes, any notice that any party gives, or any knowledge that any party obtains as a result thereof, or otherwise, shall (A) affect the liability of the parties to one another for any Breach (defined below) of this Agreement or any Related Agreement or (B) prevent any party from relying on the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or any Related Agreement. 

  

  

 As used herein, the term " _Breach_ " means any breach of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty or any breach of, or failure to perform or comply with any covenant or obligation, or any event which with the passing of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute such a breach, inaccuracy or failure. 

  

  

 (b) _ Survival._ The representations and warranties of Buyer and the Seller made in this Agreement or any Related Agreement shall survive the consummation of the transactions described herein and therein until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, other than the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.3(a), 3.3(b)_ , _3.4(b)_ , _3.5(c)_ , _3.5(d)_ , _3.5(e)_ , _3.5(f)_ , _3.5(h)_ , and _3.5(i)_ , which shall continue and survive until expiration of the statutes of limitation applicable to the subject matter of such representations and warranties. 

  

  

 6.2 _ Indemnification of Buyer._ Subject to the other provisions of this Article 6, Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold Buyer, together with its respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, subsidiaries, agents, advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants and affiliates (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ "), harmless from and against, and promptly reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for, any loss, expense, damage, deficiency, liability, claim or obligation, including investigative costs, costs of defense, settlement costs (subject to approval as provided below) and reasonable attorneys\' and accountants\' fees (collectively, " _Losses_ ") that any Buyer Indemnitee incurs or to which any Buyer Indemnitee becomes subject (directly or indirectly and including without limitation future costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with any Loss), which Losses arise out of or in connection with: 

  

   

 (i) any Breach by Seller or the Company of this Agreement, the Related Agreements or any other certificate, document, writing or instrument delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement or the Related Agreements; 

  

 (ii) any claim asserted by any third party that, assuming the truth thereof, would constitute a Breach by Seller or the Company of this Agreement, any Related Agreement, or any other certificate, document, writing or instrument delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement or a Related Agreement; 

  

 (iii) the Retained Liabilities; 

  

 (iv) any claim by any person for brokerage or finder\'s fees or commissions or similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been made by any such person with Seller (or any person acting on their behalf) in connection with the transactions contemplated herein; or 

   

 (v) any noncompliance with any Bulk Sales Laws or fraudulent transfer in respect of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and in the Related Agreements. 

   

     
  

  

For purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting from such Breach,
and therefore, any indemnification obligation under this Section 6.2, all
qualifications as to materiality set forth in Article 3 ( _Representations
and Warranties of Seller_ ) shall be ignored.

   

 6.3 _ Indemnification of Seller._ Subject to the other provisions of this _Article 6_, Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold Seller, together with its respective officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries, agents, advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants and affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ "), harmless from and against, and promptly reimburse the Seller Indemnitees for, Losses that any Seller Indemnitee incurs or to which any Seller Indemnitee becomes subject (directly or indirectly and including without limitation future costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with any Loss), which Losses arise out of or in connection with: 

  

   

 (i) any Breach by Buyer of this Agreement or any Related Agreement or any other certificate, document, writing or instrument delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or a Related Agreement; 

  

 (ii) any claim asserted by any third party that, assuming the truth thereof, would constitute a Breach by Buyer of this Agreement, any Related Agreement, or any other certificate, document, writing or instrument delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or a Related Agreement; 

   

 (iii) the Assumed Liabilities and any liability arising out of the ownership or operation of the Business or the ownership or use of the Acquired Assets after the Closing Date that does not relate to any period prior to the Closing Date and that therefore is not a Retained Liability; or 

  

 (iv) any claim by any person for brokerage or finder\'s fees or commissions or similar payments based upon any agreement or arrangement alleged to have been made by any such person with the Buyer (or any person acting on its behalf) in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. 

   

  

 6.4 _ Indemnification._ The indemnifying party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") shall promptly pay or reimburse to the indemnified party (the " _Indemnitee_ ") the amount of all Losses after the amount of any such Loss and the Indemnitor\'s liability therefore is established by (a) agreement in writing between Indemnitor and the Indemnitee or (b) by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction (any Loss so determined is referred to herein as an " _Established Loss_ "). If the Indemnitor does not pay to the Indemnitee the amount of the Established Loss on or before the 30th day after the determination described in clause (a) or (b) above then on the 31st day after such determination, the amount of the Established Loss payable by the Indemnitor shall bear interest thereafter at a rate of interest per annum that shall, from day to day, equal the lesser of (i) the variable rate of interest published in the Money Rates section of the Wall Street Journal (or the comparable section of such newspaper) as the prime rate of interest on corporate loans at large United States money center commercial banks plus five percent and (ii) the maximum rate allowed under applicable law. If any Established Loss is outstanding and unpaid on the date on which the Indemnitee is obligated to pay any amount to the Indemnitor (either pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee), then the Indemnitee may set off such Established Loss against the amount due and payable to the Indemnitor. 

  

 Buyer\'s indemnification obligations under this _Article 6_ are for the exclusive benefit of the Seller Indemnitees and are enforceable only by the Seller Indemnitees. Seller\'s indemnification obligations under this _Article 6_ are for the exclusive benefit of the Buyer Indemnitees and are enforceable only by the Buyer Indemnitees. 

     

 6.5 _ Limitations on Indemnity._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Minimum Indemnity._ Seller shall not have any liability to any Buyer Indemnitee for indemnifiable Losses under _Section 6.2_ (i) or _6.2(ii)_ , and the Buyer shall not have any liability to Seller Indemnitee for indemnifiable Losses under _Section 6.3(i)_ or _6.3(ii)_ , until and except to the extent that the Losses of such Buyer Indemnitees (together with the Losses of all other Buyer Indemnitees) or of such Seller Indemnitee (together with all other Seller Indemnitees), as the case may be, exceed $750,000. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the limitation of this _Section 6.5(a)_ shall not apply to Losses attributable to any Breach or asserted Breach of the second sentence of _Section 3.2(c)_, _Section 3.3(a)_, _Section 3.3(b) _, _Section 3.4(b)_ or _Section 3.5(b)_ or with respect to any Adjustment made pursuant to  _Section 1.4_. 

  

 (b) _ Maximum Indemnity._ Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees under _Section 6.2(i)_ or _6.2(ii)_ in an aggregate amount greater than $23,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Cap shall not limit, restrict or otherwise affect Seller\'s retention of responsibility for all Retained Liabilities or Buyer\'s (or any Buyer Indemnitee\'s) right to indemnification from Seller (or the Company\'s guaranty of Seller\'s indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 7.13) in respect of any Retained Liability; _provided_ , that to the extent any claim for indemnity is determined to relate to both a Breach to which the Cap applies and a claim in respect of a Retained Liability, then Seller\'s obligation in respect of such Retained Liability and any claim for indemnity related thereto shall not be subject to the Cap. Buyer shall not be required to indemnify Seller Indemnitees under this _Section 6.3(i)_ or _6.3(ii)_ in an amount greater than the Cap. 

  

  

 6.6 _ Notice and Opportunity to Defend._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Notice, Etc._ If any Indemnitee receives notice of any third-party claim or commencement of any third-party action or proceeding (an " _Asserted Liability_ ") with respect to which any Indemnitor is obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to _Sections 6.2_ or  _6.3_ , the Indemnitee shall promptly give all Indemnitors notice thereof. The Indemnitee\'s failure so to notify an Indemnitor shall not cause the Indemnitee to lose its right to indemnification under this _Article 6_, except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the Indemnitor\'s ability to defend against an Asserted Liability that such Indemnitor has the right to defend against hereunder (and except as otherwise set forth in this _Article 6_). Such notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and if practicable shall indicate the amount (which may be estimated) of the Losses that have been or may be asserted by the Indemnitee. The Indemnitor may defend against an Asserted Liability on behalf of the Indemnitee utilizing counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, unless (i) the Indemnitee reasonably objects to such assumption on the grounds that counsel for such Indemnitors cannot represent both the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor because such representation would be reasonably likely to result in a conflict of interest or because there may be defenses available to the Indemnitee that are not available to the Indemnitor, (ii) the Indemnitor is not capable (by reason of insufficient financial capacity, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, managerial deadlock, managerial neglect or similar events) of maintaining a reasonable defense of such action or proceeding, or (iii) the action or proceeding seeks injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnitee. 

  

 (b) _ Defense Costs._ If any Indemnitor defends an Asserted Liability, it shall do so at its own expense (which costs shall count toward the calculation of the limitations contained in _Sections 6.5(a)_ and _6.5(b)_ ) and shall not be responsible for the costs of defense, investigative costs, reasonable attorney\'s fees or other expenses incurred to defend the Asserted Liability (collectively, " _Defense Costs_ ") of the Indemnitee (which may continue to defend, at its own expense). If the Indemnitee assumes the defense of an Asserted Liability by reason of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of Subsection (a) above, or because the Indemnitor has not elected to assume the defense, then such 

  

    
  

 Indemnitor shall indemnify the Indemnitee for its reasonable Defense Costs
(subject to _Sections 6.5(a)_ and _6.5(b)_ ); _provided_ , _however_ , the
Indemnitors shall not be liable for the costs of more than one counsel for
all Indemnitees in any one jurisdiction. An Indemnitor may settle any Asserted
Liability only with the consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

 (c) _ Third Party Claims._ The parties shall cooperate with each other with respect to the defense of any claims or litigation made or commenced by third parties subsequent to the date hereof with respect to which indemnification is not available (for any reason) under this _Article 6_, _provided_ that the party requesting cooperation shall reimburse the other party for the other party\'s reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of furnishing such cooperation. 

  

  

 6.7 _ Delays or Omissions, Etc.._ Except as provided in _Section 6.1(c)_ and _Section 6.6(a) _, no delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy inuring to any party upon any breach or default of any party under this Agreement or any Related Agreement shall impair any such right, power or remedy of such party nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise any remedy under this Agreement or any Related Agreement will constitute an election of remedies or limit in any manner enforcement of any remedies. All remedies either under this Agreement or any Related Agreement or by law or otherwise afforded to the parties shall be cumulative and not alternative.
