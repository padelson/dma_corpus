EFFECTS OF THE MERGERS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the US LEC Effective Time or the PAETEC Effective Time, as
applicable, by virtue of the US LEC Merger or the PAETEC Merger, as
applicable, and without any action on the part of any party or the holders of
any shares of capital stock of any party:

(a) _Conversion of US LEC Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 2.1(g)_ and 
_2.1(h)_ , each share of US LEC Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the US LEC Effective Time, other than any shares of US
LEC Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_, shall be
automatically converted into and become the right to receive one (the " _US
LEC Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable share of Company Common
Stock (the " _US LEC Merger Consideration_ "). As a result of the US LEC
Merger, at the US LEC Effective Time, each holder of a US LEC Certificate (as
defined in _Section 2.2(b)_) shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except that such US LEC Certificate shall represent only the right to
receive the US LEC Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares
of US LEC Common Stock represented by such US LEC Certificate immediately
prior to the US LEC Effective Time, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable pursuant to  _Section 2.1(g)_ and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_, all to be issued or paid,
without interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such US LEC
Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ (or, in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed US LEC Certificate, _Section 2.2(i)_).

(b)  _Cancellation of Shares_. Each share of US LEC Common Stock that is
owned by US LEC, PAETEC or the Company shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub U Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub U issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the US LEC Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one
newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock
of the US LEC Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Conversion of PAETEC Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 2.1(g)_ ,
_2.1(h)_ and _2.1(i)_ , each share of PAETEC Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of
PAETEC Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_, shall be
automatically converted into and become the right to receive 1.623 (the "
_PAETEC Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _PAETEC Merger Consideration_ " and together with the US
LEC Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As a result of the
PAETEC Merger, at the PAETEC Effective Time, each holder of a PAETEC
Certificate (as defined in _Section 2.2(b)_) shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except that such PAETEC Certificate shall represent
only the right to receive the PAETEC Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect of



 

7 the shares of PAETEC Common Stock represented by such PAETEC Certificate
immediately prior to the PAETEC Effective Time, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(g)_ and any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_, all to be issued or
paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
PAETEC Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ (or, in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed PAETEC Certificate, _Section 2.2(i)_).

(e) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each share of PAETEC Common Stock that is owned
by US LEC, PAETEC or the Company shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(f) _Conversion of Merger Sub P Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub P issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the PAETEC Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one
newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock
of the PAETEC Surviving Corporation.

(g) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Company Common Stock shall
be issued by virtue of the Mergers, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares
of PAETEC Common Stock or US LEC Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled
to a fraction of a share of Company Common Stock (after aggregating all shares
of Company Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder)
shall, upon surrender of such holders Certificate or Certificates (as defined
in _Section 2.2(b)_), receive from the Company an amount of cash (rounded to
the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) the
fractional share interest (after aggregating all shares of Company Common
Stock that would otherwise be received by such holder) which such holder would
otherwise receive, multiplied by (ii) the average of the closing prices of
one share of US LEC Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market (" _NASDAQ_ ")
for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(h) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_.

(i) So as to maintain the relative proportionate interests of the holders of
the PAETEC Common Stock and the US LEC Common Stock in the Company Common
Stock immediately following the Effective Time intended by this Agreement as
of the date hereof, the PAETEC Exchange Ratio, the PAETEC Merger
Consideration, the US LEC Exchange Ratio and the US LEC Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split,
split-up, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable
for, PAETEC Common Stock, US LEC Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination or exchange
of shares, or other similar change with respect to PAETEC Common Stock, US LEC
Common Stock or Company Common Stock having a record date occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(ii) US LEC and PAETEC agree that they will review together the trading prices
in the US LEC Common Stock in the period following public announcement of 



 

8 the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with a view to assessing the
ability of the Company Common Stock to satisfy the $5.00 per share minimum
bid price requirement for initial listing of the Company Common Stock on
NASDAQ (the " _Minimum Trading Price Test_ "). If, based on such trading
prices, it appears reasonably likely that the trading prices of the Company
Common Stock would appear to fail to meet the Minimum Trading Price Test, US
LEC and PAETEC will decrease both the US LEC Exchange Ratio and the PAETEC
Exchange Ratio, in such a manner as shall maintain the relative proportionate
interests of the holders of the PAETEC Common Stock and the US LEC Common
Stock in the Company Common Stock immediately following the Effective Time
intended by this Agreement as of the date hereof, so as to decrease the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock to be issued in the Mergers and
thereby increase the expected trading prices for the Company Common Stock to a
level reasonably sufficient to meet the Minimum Trading Price Test. More than
one adjustment to the US LEC Exchange Ratio and the PAETEC Exchange Ratio may
be made under this _Section 2.1(h)(ii)_. US LEC and PAETEC will determine
whether any such adjustment should be made both before the mailing of the
Joint Proxy Statement (as defined in  _Section 3.1(e)_) and before the US
LEC Stockholders Meeting (as defined in _Section 5.1(b)_) and the PAETEC
Stockholders Meeting (as defined in _Section 5.1(b)_) are held, and may make
any such adjustment even if such an adjustment would require a postponement
of the US LEC Stockholders Meeting and the PAETEC Stockholders Meeting and
the preparation, clearance with the SEC (as defined in _Section 3.1(d)_) and
mailing of supplemental proxy materials.

(i) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.1(d)_,
each share of PAETEC Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the PAETEC Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of
the PAETEC Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded
appraisal for such share of PAETEC Common Stock in accordance with the DGCL
shall not be converted into a right to receive the PAETEC Merger Consideration
to be paid with respect to such share of PAETEC Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.1(d)_ but shall be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such share
pursuant to the DGCL, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal. If, after the
PAETEC Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such
holders right to appraisal, such share shall be deemed to have been converted
as of the PAETEC Effective Time into a right to receive the PAETEC Merger
Consideration to be paid with respect to such share pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)_. PAETEC shall give US LEC prompt notice of any demands received by
PAETEC for appraisal of shares of PAETEC Common Stock, and US LEC shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Except with the prior written consent of US LEC, PAETEC shall
not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands.

SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, the Company shall engage an
institution reasonably satisfactory to US LEC and PAETEC (and US LECs
transfer agent shall be deemed satisfactory to US LEC and PAETEC) to act as
exchange agent in connection with the Mergers (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
pursuant to an agreement reasonably



 

9 satisfactory to US LEC and PAETEC. At the Effective Time, the Company shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
shares of PAETEC Common Stock and US LEC Common Stock immediately prior to the
PAETEC Effective Time and the US LEC Effective Time, respectively,
certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock
issuable pursuant to _Sections 2.1(a)_ and _2.1(d)_. In addition, the Company
shall make available by depositing with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from
time to time after the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to make
the payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(g)_ and
any dividends or distributions to which former holders of shares of PAETEC
Common Stock and of US LEC Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to _Section
2.2(c)_. All cash and certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_."

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event
within ten business days after the Effective Time, PAETEC shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the PAETEC Effective Time or the US
LEC Effective Time, as applicable, represented outstanding shares of PAETEC
Common Stock (the " _PAETEC Certificates_ ") or of US LEC Common Stock (the "
_US LEC Certificates_ " and together with the PAETEC Certificates, the "
_Certificates_ "), which at the PAETEC Effective Time or the US LEC Effective
Time, as applicable, were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and which shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to US LEC and PAETEC) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing whole shares of Company Common Stock, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(g)_ and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Company Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (which shall be in uncertificated book entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested), payment by cash or check in lieu
of fractional shares which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to 
_Section 2.1(g)_ and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of PAETEC Common
Stock or US LEC Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records
of PAETEC or US LEC, respectively, a certificate representing the proper
number of shares of Company Common Stock may be issued to a Person (as defined
in  _Section 8.3(q)_) other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in _Section
3.1(j)(xi)_) required by reason of the issuance of shares of Company Common
Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company that such Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
PAETEC Effective Time or the US LEC 



 

10 Effective Time, as applicable, to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section
2.1(g)_ or _Section 2.2(c)_) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid
or shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(g)_ or
_Section 2.2(c)_.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. All shares of
Company Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Mergers shall be deemed
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by the Company in respect of Company Common
Stock, the record date for which dividend or other distribution is after the
Effective Time, such declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no dividends or other distributions with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to _Section 2.1(g)_, until such Certificate has been
surrendered in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to Applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be delivered to the
record holder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender,
the number of whole shares of Company Common Stock issuable in exchange
therefor pursuant to this _Article II_ , together with any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Company Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(g)_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Company Common Stock.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in _Section 2.1(a)_, _2.1(d)_
or _2.2(b)_ , holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to vote
after the Effective Time at any meeting of Company stockholders that number
of whole shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates,
regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in PAETEC Common Stock or US LEC Common
Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article
II_ and any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(g)_ or _Section 2.2(c)_ shall
be deemed to have been issued (or paid) in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of PAETEC Common Stock or US LEC Common
Stock, as applicable, previously represented by such Certificates. After the
PAETEC Effective Time and the US LEC Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of PAETEC and US LEC, respectively, shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the PAETEC
Surviving Corporation or the US LEC Surviving Corporation, respectively, of
the shares of PAETEC Common Stock or US LEC Common Stock, respectively, which
were outstanding immediately prior to the PAETEC Effective Time or the US LEC
Effective Time, respectively. If, after the PAETEC Effective Time or the US
LEC Effective Time, respectively, Certificates are presented to the PAETEC
Surviving Corporation or the US LEC Surviving Corporation, respectively, or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.



 

11 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company, upon demand, and any holders
of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Company for delivery of their claim for the
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(g)_ and any dividends or distributions
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_.

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, PAETEC, US LEC or the Exchange Agent
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any PAETEC Certificate or US LEC
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the
PAETEC Effective Time or the US LEC Effective Time, respectively, or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Company Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock or any
dividends or distributions with respect to Company Common Stock issuable in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity (as defined in _Section 8.3(f)_), any such shares,
cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Laws, become the property of the Company, free
and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Company, _provided_ that no
such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former
stockholders of PAETEC or US LEC after the Effective Time pursuant to this
_Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable pursuant to this _Article II_ shall promptly be paid to the
Company.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. The Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person who was a holder of PAETEC Common Stock or US LEC
Common Stock immediately prior to the PAETEC Effective Time or the US LEC
Effective Time, respectively, such amounts as the Company or the Exchange
Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company or
the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration
would otherwise have been paid.

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Company Common
Stock as may be required pursuant to _Section 2.1(a) _or _2.1(d)_ , cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(g)_ and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,



 

12 stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in
form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or a bond in such sum as the
Company may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made
against the Company or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

date it is first mailed to PAETECs stockholders or at the time of the PAETEC
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which

23 whether PAETEC or its Subsidiaries will be required to refund any material
intercarrier compensation amounts previously billed and collected or

and complete list of each material bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred

option or other equity compensation, phantom stock, stock-related or
performance award, retirement, vacation, severance or termination pay, change
in control, retention, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical,
life insurance, loan, disability, and other similar material plan, agreement,
policy or arrangement, including each "employee benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), each material employment agreement, consulting
agreement, termination or severance agreement, and each other employee benefit
plan, fund, program, agreement or arrangement, in each case, that is
sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to by
PAETEC or by any trade or business, whether or not incorporated (an " _ERISA
Affiliate_ "), of PAETEC, or to which PAETEC or an ERISA Affiliate of PAETEC
is party, whether written or oral, for the benefit of any current or former
employee, officer or director of PAETEC or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_PAETEC Benefit Plans_ "). No PAETEC Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA. With respect to the PAETEC Benefit Plans, no event has
occurred, and there exists no condition or set of circumstances, which has or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on PAETEC and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither PAETEC nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the Knowledge of PAETEC, any other Person, has any express commitment,
whether legally enforceable or not, to modify, change or terminate any PAETEC
Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or termination
required by ERISA or the Code, or any other Applicable Law or administrative
changes that do not increase the liabilities or obligations under any such
plans.



 

24 (ii) Each PAETEC Benefit Plan has been, in all material respects, administered
and operated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Laws, including
ERISA and the Code. Each PAETEC Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within
the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the trusts
maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code, and, to the Knowledge of PAETEC, no condition exists that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification.

(iii) As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of PAETEC, no oral or written
representation or commitment with respect to any material aspect of
any PAETEC Benefit Plan has been made to an employee or former employee of
PAETEC or any of its Subsidiaries by an authorized PAETEC employee that is not
materially in accordance with the written or otherwise pre-existing terms and
provisions of such PAETEC Benefit Plan.

(iv) There are no material unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of,
or in connection with, any PAETEC Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits), and no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced or, to the
Knowledge of PAETEC, threatened with respect to any material claim or
otherwise in connection with a PAETEC Benefit Plan. 

(v) No PAETEC Benefit Plan provides health benefits (whether or not insured)
with respect to employees or former employees of PAETEC or any of its
Subsidiaries after retirement or other termination of service, other than
coverage mandated by Applicable Law or benefits the full cost of which is
borne by the employee or former employee.

(vi) Neither the negotiation and execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any PAETEC Benefit Plan that will or may result in any payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of payment, forgiveness
of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any employee or former employee of PAETEC or any
of its Subsidiaries or limit the ability to amend or terminate any PAETEC
Benefit Plan or related trust. There is no contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement with an employee or former employee of PAETEC to which PAETEC or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement that,
individually or collectively and as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent

are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance
with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of US LECs

requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this

of US LEC, threatened or being carried out against US LEC or its Subsidiaries;
and (iv) neither US LEC nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice that any representation or certification petition respecting the
employees of US LEC or its Subsidiaries has been filed with the National
Labor Relations Board or analogous Governmental Entity.

(i) _Benefit Plans_. Except as may be disclosed in the US LEC SEC Documents
with respect to the matters set forth in this _Section 3.2(i)_ (other than
the first sentence of _Section 3.2(i)(i)_):

(i) _Section 3.2(i)(i)_ of the US LEC Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of each material bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred
compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock
option or other equity compensation, phantom stock, stock-related or
performance award, retirement, vacation, severance or termination pay, change
in control, retention, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical,
life insurance, loan, disability, and other similar material plan, agreement,
policy or arrangement, including each "employee benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, each material employment agreement,
consulting agreement, termination or severance agreement, and each other
employee benefit plan, fund, program, agreement or arrangement, in each case,
that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed
to by US LEC or by any ERISA Affiliate, that together with US LEC would be
deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA, or
to which US LEC or an ERISA Affiliate of US LEC is party, whether written or
oral, for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director
of US LEC or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _US LEC Benefit Plans_ "). None of
the US LEC Benefit Plans is subject to Title IV of ERISA. With respect to the
US LEC Benefit Plans, no event has occurred, and there exists no condition or
set of circumstances, which has, or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on US LEC and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Neither US LEC nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of US LEC,
any other Person, has any express commitment, whether legally enforceable or
not, to modify, change or terminate any US LEC Benefit Plan, other than with
respect to a modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the
Code, or any other Applicable Law or administrative changes that do not
increase the liabilities or obligations under any such plans.

(ii) Each US LEC Benefit Plan has been, in all material respects, administered
and operated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law, including ERISA
and the Code. Each US LEC Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the trusts
maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of
the Code, and, to the Knowledge of US LEC, no condition exists that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification.

(iii) As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of US LEC, no oral or written
representation or commitment with respect to any material aspect of any US LEC



 

46 Benefit Plan has been made to an employee or former employee of US LEC or any
of its Subsidiaries by an authorized US LEC employee that is not materially
in accordance with the written or otherwise pre-existing terms and provisions
of such US LEC Benefit Plan.

(iv) There are no material unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of,
or in connection with, any US LEC Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits), and no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced or, to the

otherwise in connection with a US LEC Benefit Plan.

(v) No US LEC Benefit Plan provides health benefits (whether or not insured)
with respect to employees or former employees of US LEC or any of its
Subsidiaries after retirement or other termination of service, other than
coverage mandated by Applicable Law or benefits the full cost of which is
borne by the employee or former employee.

(vi) Neither the negotiation and execution of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall (either alone
or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any US LEC Benefit Plan that will or may result in any payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of payment, forgiveness
of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any employee or former employee of US LEC or any
of its Subsidiaries or limit the ability to amend or terminate any US LEC
Benefit Plan or related trust. There is no contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement with an employee or former employee of US LEC to which US LEC or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement that,
individually or collectively, and as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
events), would give rise to the payment of any amount that would not
be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code.

on its behalf) in full all material Taxes required to be paid by it, (C) made

Agreement. 



 

47 (iii) There is no audit, examination, refund litigation, proposed adjustment
or matter in controversy with respect to any Taxes or Tax Return of US LEC or
any of its Subsidiaries. Neither US LEC nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice of any claim made by a Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where US LEC or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, does not
file a Tax Return, that US LEC or such Subsidiary is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction.

including any predecessors thereof, have been examined by the applicable Tax

such examinations which have not been resolved and fully paid or accrued as a
liability on the US LEC financial statements provided prior to the date of

LEC or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise.

(vii) Neither US LEC nor any of its Subsidiaries has (A) agreed to make nor
is it required to make any material adjustment under Section 481(a) of the
Code by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise; or (B)
constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation"
(within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of
stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (x)
in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (y) in a distribution
which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code)
in connection with the Mergers.

whole, US LEC and its Subsidiaries own (i) good and valid title to the Owned
Real Property and (ii) valid and enforceable leasehold interests with respect
to the Leased Real Property, in each case subject to Permitted Liens. Except
in any such case as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on US LEC and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, all Improvements with respect to the Real Property of US
LEC and its Subsidiaries are in good repair and operating condition, subject
only to ordinary wear and tear, and are adequate and suitable for the purposes
for which they are presently being used or held for use, and, to the
Knowledge of US LEC, there are no facts or conditions affecting any of such
Improvements that, in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to interfere
with the current use, occupancy or operation thereof.

repudiated or has the right to terminate or repudiate any Right-of-Way
Agreement.

53 with any others, would materially and adversely affect the ability of US LEC
or any of its Subsidiaries to use any of the rights associated with the
Right-of-Way Agreements, taken as a whole, in the manner and scope in which
such rights are now being used.

(iii) Except in any such case as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have, or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on US LEC
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole:

(A) All Owned Network Facilities and Leased Network Facilities: (x) are in
Good Condition individually and in combination; (y) are, individually and in
combination, operated, installed, and maintained by US LEC, US LECs
Subsidiaries, or their contractors in a manner that is in compliance with (1)
Industry Standards, (2) Customer Requirements, and (3) all Applicable Laws,
and (z) comply, individually and in combination, with applicable performance
standards.

(B) US LEC owns, free of Liens other than Permitted Liens, all rights, titles,

(y) no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default by US LEC or any of its Subsidiaries or permit
termination, revocation, other interference with performance of, modification
or acceleration by any third party of any Network Facility Agreement, and (z)
no third Person has repudiated, revoked, terminated or otherwise interfered
with performance of or has the right to terminate, repudiate, revoke or
otherwise interfere with the performance of any Network Facility Agreement.

(t) _Tax-Free Treatment_. Neither US LEC nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken
(or caused to be taken) any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or
other circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent the US LEC
Merger together with the PAETEC Merger from qualifying as an integrated series
of transfers qualifying under Section 351 of the Code.

(u) _Insurance_. All material insurance policies of US LEC and its
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and provide insurance in such
amounts and against such risks as the management of US LEC reasonably has
determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practices or as is
required by Applicable Laws. Neither US LEC nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
material breach or default, and neither US LEC nor any of its Subsidiaries has
taken any action or failed to take any action which, with notice or the lapse
of time or both, would constitute such a breach or default, or
permit termination or modification of any of the material insurance policies
of US LEC and its Subsidiaries. True and complete copies of all such material
insurance policies have been made available to PAETEC.



 

54 (v) _Customers and Suppliers_.

(i) As of the date of this Agreement, neither (A) US LEC nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice from any customer, or group of

LEC or its Subsidiaries, nor (B) has US LEC or any US LEC Subsidiary received
notice from any supplier, or group of suppliers that are under common

of US LEC, to account for at least $1,000,000 of the aggregate goods and
services purchased by US LEC and the US LEC Subsidiaries in the fiscal

group of suppliers) has stopped or intends to stop providing goods or services
to US LEC or any US LEC Subsidiary, or has materially reduced or will
materially reduce the supply of, or has sought or is seeking to materially
increase the price it charges for, goods or services supplied to the US LEC or
a US LEC Subsidiary.

(ii) Except for requests for call detail records for billing purposes, neither
US LEC nor any of its Subsidiaries is, as of the date hereof, involved in any
dispute with, or has received any notice of an intention to dispute from, or
has received any request for audit, accounting or review from, any Person

marketable title to each item of material owned personal property free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation enacted
under state or federal laws in the United States (with the exception
of Section 203 of the DGCL) applicable to US LEC is applicable to the Mergers

inapplicable to this Agreement (and the transactions provided for herein) the
restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL.

officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any

consolidation, business combination, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital
stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving
PAETEC or US LEC or any of their respective Subsidiaries that, if consummated,
would constitute, or would reasonably be expected to constitute, an
Alternative Transaction (as defined in _Section 8.3(b)_) (any of
the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an "
_Alternative Transaction Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or an Alternative
Transaction Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement regarding an Alternative

hours) after receipt of any Alternative Transaction Proposal, or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Alternative Transaction Proposal

respectively, or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal. Such notice to PAETEC or US LEC, as the
case may be, shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the
identity of the Person making the Alternative Transaction Proposal or such
request and the material terms of any such Alternative Transaction Proposal
or any material modification or material amendment to an Alternative
Transaction Proposal (including a copy thereof if such Alternative Transaction
Proposal or material modification or material amendment is in writing). From
the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement, PAETEC shall keep US LEC and US LEC shall keep PAETEC
reasonably informed on a current basis of any material changes in the status
and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, indication or request. US LEC or PAETEC, as
the case may be, shall provide the other party with 48 hours prior notice (or
such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of its Board of
Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its Board of
Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Alternative Transaction
Proposal or Alternative Transaction.

(c) _Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in _Section 4.2(a)_, in the event that US LEC or PAETEC, as the case may be,
receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal
that is determined (in accordance with _Section 8.3(t)_) to be, or is
reasonably likely to be, a Superior Proposal (as defined in  _Section
8.3(t)_), it may then take the following actions (but only (1) if and to the
extent that (y) its Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so
is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to
its stockholders under Applicable Laws, and (z) US LEC or PAETEC, as the case
may be, has given the other party at least two business days prior written
notice of its intention to take any of the following actions and (2) if it
shall not have breached in any material respect any of the provisions of this
_Section 4.2_):



 

61 (i) Furnish nonpublic information to the Person or group of Persons making
such Superior Proposal,  _provided_ that (A) prior to furnishing any such
nonpublic information, it receives from such Person or group of Persons an
executed confidentiality and standstill agreement containing terms at least as
restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as
of June 23, 2006, between US LEC and PAETEC (the "CDA") and (B)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
Person or group of Persons, it furnishes such nonpublic information to the
other party hereto (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously so furnished to such party); and

(ii) Engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group of
Persons with respect to such Superior Proposal.

(d)  _Changes of Recommendation_.

(i) In response to the receipt of an unsolicited, bona fide written
Alternative Transaction Proposal which is determined (in accordance with
_Section 8.3(t)_) to be a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of US LEC
or PAETEC, as the case may be, may make a Change of Recommendation, if all of
the following conditions in clauses (A) through (E) are met:

(A) the Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and
continues to be a Superior Proposal;

(B) the US LEC Stockholder Approval or the PAETEC Stockholder Approval, as the
case may be, has not occurred;

(C) US LEC or PAETEC, as the case may be, has (1) complied with the provisions
of _Sections 4.2(b)_  and _4.2(c)_ of this Agreement, (2) provided to the
other party hereto four business days prior written notice which shall state
expressly that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner
in which it intends to do so and (3) during the aforementioned period, if
requested by the other party hereto, engaged in good faith negotiations so
that the other party is able to make a revised proposal to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that the Alternative Transaction Proposal which
was determined to be a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal;

(D) the Board of Directors of US LEC or PAETEC, as the case may be, has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of
Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation is reasonably likely to result
in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Applicable
Laws; and

(E) US LEC or PAETEC, as the case may be, shall not have breached in any
material respect any of the provisions set forth in this _Section 4.2_.

(ii) A " _Change of Recommendation_ " shall mean the withholding, withdrawal,
amendment, qualification or modification of the Board of Directors
recommendation in favor of, in the case of PAETEC, adoption and approval of
this Agreement



 

62 and the transactions contemplated hereby, and, in the case of US LEC, adoption
and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company Charter Amendment and the New Equity Plan, and, in the case of a
tender or exchange offer made directly to US LECs stockholders or PAETECs
stockholders, as the case may be, a recommendation that US LECs stockholders
or PAETECs stockholders, as the case may be, accept the tender or exchange
offer.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.2_ shall prohibit PAETEC or US LEC
or their respective Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to their
respective stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(f) PAETEC and its Subsidiaries, and US LEC and its Subsidiaries,
respectively, shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than US LEC or PAETEC,
respectively) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than PAETEC or US
LEC who have been furnished confidential information regarding PAETEC or US
LEC in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an
Alternative Transaction Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof
promptly to return or destroy such information. Each of PAETEC and US LEC
agree not to, and to cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, release any
third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any
agreement to which PAETEC or US LEC or any of their respective Subsidiaries
is or may become a party and to use its reasonable best efforts to enforce, to
the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, the provisions of any such
confidentiality and standstill provisions.

(g) PAETEC and US LEC shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
inform their respective Representatives of the restrictions described in this
_Section 4.2_. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 4.2_ by any officer, director, employee, agent or
representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other retained advisor) of PAETEC or its Subsidiaries, or US LEC
or its Subsidiaries, respectively, at the direction or with the consent of
PAETEC or US LEC, respectively, or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 4.2_ by PAETEC or US
LEC, respectively.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, US LEC and
PAETEC shall prepare the Joint Proxy Statement and US LEC, the Company and
PAETEC shall prepare and the Company shall file with the SEC the Form S-4, in
which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of the
Company, US LEC and PAETEC shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing. US LEC shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint
Proxy Statement to be mailed to US LECs stockholders, and PAETEC shall use



 

63 reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to
PAETECs stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Subject to _Section
4.2(d)_, the Joint Proxy Statement shall contain the Recommendations. The
Company, PAETEC and US LEC shall also take any action (other than qualifying
to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or
filing a general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance
and reservation of shares of Company Common Stock in the Mergers, the
conversion of PAETEC Warrants and US LEC Warrants into Company Warrants, the
conversion of PAETEC Options and US LEC Options into options to acquire
Company Common Stock, and the conversion of PAETEC Unit Awards and US LEC
Purchase Rights into stock units and purchase rights, respectively, with
respect to Company Common Stock. PAETEC shall furnish to US LEC all
information concerning PAETEC and the holders of PAETEC Common Stock, PAETEC
Warrants, PAETEC Options and PAETEC Unit Awards, as may be reasonably
requested by US LEC in connection with any such action. US LEC shall furnish
to the Company and PAETEC all information concerning US LEC and the holders of
US LEC Common Stock, US LEC Warrants, US LEC Options and US LEC Purchase
Rights as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with such
action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement and no response to SEC comments thereon shall be made by (i)
the Company or PAETEC or (ii) US LEC without US LECs or PAETECs (as
applicable) prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) and without providing US LEC or PAETEC, as applicable, the
opportunity to review and comment thereon, unless (x) the Company or PAETEC or
(y) US LEC would be in violation of Applicable Laws if it were to delay such
filing, amendment or supplement in order to receive such prior consent (
_provided_ that the Company and PAETEC and US LEC shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide US LEC or PAETEC, as applicable, with the opportunity
to review and comment thereon). The Company or PAETEC shall advise US LEC,
promptly after it receives oral or written notice thereof, of the time when
the Form S-4 has been declared effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Company Common Stock or the Company Warrants

jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information and shall promptly
provide the other with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any
state securities commission. The Company, PAETEC and US LEC shall prepare any
written response to any such SEC comments. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to US LEC or PAETEC or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by US LEC
or PAETEC which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of
the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the respective stockholders of US LEC and PAETEC.

(b) Each of PAETEC and US LEC shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, take all action necessary
in



 

64 accordance with Applicable Laws and the PAETEC Organizational Documents, in
the case of PAETEC, and Applicable Laws and the US LEC Organizational
Documents, in the case of US LEC, to duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of their stockholders, respectively, to be held as promptly as
practicable to consider, in the case of US LEC, the adoption of
this Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company Charter Amendment and the New Equity Plan (the " _US LEC Stockholders
 Meeting_") and, in the case of PAETEC, the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _PAETEC
Stockholders  Meeting_"). Subject to _Section 4.2(d)_, each of PAETEC and US
LEC shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit from their
stockholders, respectively, proxies in favor of, in the case of US LEC, the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Company Charter Amendment and the New Equity Plan, and in the case
of PAETEC, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of their stockholders, respectively,
required by Applicable Laws and, in the case of US LEC, the NASDAQ
Marketplace Rules, to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, PAETEC or US LEC may adjourn or postpone
the PAETEC Stockholders Meeting or the US LEC Stockholders Meeting, as
the case may be, to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to their
respective stockholders, in advance of a vote on, in the case of US LEC, the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Company Charter Amendment and the New Equity Plan, and in the case
of PAETEC, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or, if, as of the time for which the PAETEC
Stockholders Meeting or the US LEC Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be,
is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of PAETEC Common Stock
or US LEC Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting. Each of PAETEC and US LEC shall ensure that the PAETEC Stockholders
Meeting and the US LEC Stockholders Meeting, respectively, are called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in

not participate in any meeting or oral communication with any such
Governmental Entity with respect to the PAETEC Merger, the US LEC Merger, or

Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat; (iv) furnish the other party with copies of all

US LEC (and its Subsidiaries) and PAETEC (and its Subsidiaries) may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section 5.4_ as "outside
counsel only." Such material and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and shall not be

require the Company, US LEC or PAETEC to take any action, or commit to take
any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with
obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
Governmental Entities, that would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Company, the US LEC Surviving Corporation, the PAETEC
Surviving Corporation, and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

For at least six years after the Effective Time, each of the Company and the

fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative) by reason of the fact that such Person is or was an officer,
director or employee of US LEC or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including those
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), and shall
advance expenses in respect thereof, in each case, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Laws. For at least six years after the Effective

to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that
the



 

69 Company may substitute therefor new policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous than
such current policies to former officers and directors of US LEC only with
respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate annual
premiums for any such current or new policies at any time during such six-year
period would exceed 300% of the per annum premium rate paid by US LEC and its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for such current policies, then the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide as much coverage under
such current or new policies as is then available at such aggregate annual
premiums up to 300% of such per annum premium rate.

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause to be maintained in effect the

insurance maintained by PAETEC with respect to claims arising from facts or
events which occurred on or before the Effective Time (including those related
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that
the Company may substitute therefor new policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous
than such current policies to former officers and directors of PAETEC, as the
case may be, only with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if
the aggregate annual premiums for any such current or new policies at any
time during such six-year period would exceed 300% of the per annum premium
rate paid by PAETEC and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for such
current policies, then the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide as much coverage under such current or new policies as is then
available at such aggregate annual premiums up to 300% of such per annum
premium rate.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and to the maximum extent
permitted by Applicable Laws, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation is made or brought against any Indemnified Party on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section
5.5_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(e) If the Company, US LEC or PAETEC or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, in each case, the Company, US LEC or PAETEC
shall take such action as may be necessary so that such Person shall assume
all of the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section 5.5_.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her

SECTION 5.9 _Tax-Free Treatment_.

(a) Neither US LEC nor PAETEC or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall
take or cause to be taken any action (including agreeing to any transaction
or entering into any agreement) that would result in the US LEC Merger

and converted into an option, right or warrant, as applicable, to purchase
Company Common Stock on the same terms and conditions applicable to such
PAETEC Option, PAETEC Warrant, US LEC Option, US LEC Purchase Right or US LEC
Warrant, as applicable (including any applicable option award agreement,
warrant instrument or other document evidencing such PAETEC Option, PAETEC
Warrant, US LEC Option, US LEC Purchase Right or US LEC Warrant, as

vesting and exercisability provisions without any acceleration thereof, except
that:

(A) each assumed PAETEC Option or each assumed PAETEC Warrant, as applicable,

Company Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of PAETEC
Common Stock that were subject to such assumed PAETEC Option or assumed PAETEC
Warrant, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied
by the PAETEC Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share;

(B) the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each assumed PAETEC Option or each assumed PAETEC

PAETEC Option or each assumed PAETEC Warrant, as applicable, by the PAETEC

(E) the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each such assumed US LEC Option, each such assumed
US LEC Purchase Right or each such assumed US LEC Warrant, as applicable,
shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per share exercise
price of US LEC Common Stock of such assumed US LEC Option, assumed US LEC
Purchase Right or assumed US LEC Warrant, as applicable, by the US LEC

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversion of any PAETEC Option or US LEC
Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" within the meaning
of Section 422 of the Code into an option to purchase Company Common Stock,
and the conversion of a US LEC Purchase Right into a right to purchase Company
Common Stock, shall be made so as not to constitute a "modification" of such
PAETEC Option, US LEC Option or US LEC Purchase Right within the meaning
of Section 424 of the Code.

agreement or other document evidencing such PAETEC Unit Award) immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including existing vesting and delivery
provisions without any acceleration thereof, except that each PAETEC Unit

prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the PAETEC Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest whole share.

(iii) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall assume the PAETEC

US LEC Stock Plan.

(iv) Each of PAETEC and US LEC shall take all corporate action necessary
(including in the case of PAETEC, amending any PAETEC Stock Agreements), so
that, as of the Effective Time, (1) each PAETEC Option, each PAETEC Unit
Award, each PAETEC Warrant, each US LEC Option, each US LEC Purchase Right and

Employees_ ") on terms and conditions with respect to salary and wages that
are substantially similar to those terms and conditions in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as prohibiting the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the US LEC
Surviving Corporation) from terminating the employment of any employee of US
LEC and its Subsidiaries (including the US LEC Surviving Corporation) for any
reason following the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing, the Company

75 Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) the New Equity Plan shall be submitted
to US LECs stockholders for approval at the US LEC Stockholders Meeting,
_provided_ that the effectiveness of the New Equity Plan shall be subject to
consummation of the Mergers.

SECTION 5.12 _Affiliates_. PAETEC shall use its reasonable efforts to cause
each Person who is, in PAETECs reasonable judgment, an "affiliate" of PAETEC
within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act ("
_PAETEC Rule 145 Affiliates_ ") to deliver to the Company, as soon as
reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the PAETEC Stockholders

received by US LEC Rule 145 Affiliates in the US LEC Merger reflecting the
restrictions set forth in Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act and
to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for
Company Common Stock ( _provided_ that such legends or stop transfer

SECTION 5.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. US LEC shall give prompt
notice to PAETEC and PAETEC shall give prompt notice to US LEC, as the case
may be, of the occurrence, or failure to occur, with respect to the other
party, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur would reasonably be
expected to cause (a) (i) any representation or warranty of the other party
contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii)
any other representation or warranty of the other party contained in this
Agreement that is not qualified as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse
Effect" to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at
any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,

any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement. In addition, US LEC shall give prompt notice to PAETEC
and PAETEC shall give prompt notice to US LEC, as the case may be, of any
change or event having, or which would reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on the party receiving such notice and its

result in the failure by the other party to satisfy any of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied by such other party. Notwithstanding the
above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ shall not
limit or otherwise affect the

Merger or the US LEC Merger, as applicable.

SECTION 5.14 _Financing_.

(a) The Company, US LEC and PAETEC shall use their respective reasonable best

connection with the Mergers in an aggregate amount set forth therein (the "
_Financing_ ") (including all conditions relating to cooperating and assisting
Deutsche Bank and Merrill in their syndication efforts with respect to the
Financing). If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, all of such parties
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources (on terms and conditions, taken
as a whole, no less favorable to the Company in any material respect than
those set forth in the Commitment Letter) in an amount sufficient to
refinance the senior secured indebtedness of US LEC and PAETEC referred to in

105.5% (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount thereof), together
with all accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, repurchase or
discharge, as the case may be. US LEC shall use its reasonable best efforts to

such redemption, repurchase and/or discharge on the Closing Date or as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter.

(x) the existing first lien credit agreement, dated as of June 12, 2006, and
(y) the existing second lien credit agreement, dated as of June 12, 2006

in full by the Company from the proceeds of the Financing or the alternative
financing referred to in _Section 5.14(a)_, all as set forth in payoff
letters from the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Existing PAETEC
Credit Agreements), and PAETEC shall, and shall cause PAETEC Sub to,
terminate all commitments and letters of credit issued under the Existing
PAETEC Credit Agreements. PAETEC shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver the proper
instruments evidencing such repayment and termination on the Closing Date or

in connection with such stockholder litigation shall be agreed to without such
other partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably

obligations in this _Section 5.15_ shall be subject to the obligations of
each such party under Applicable Laws relating to attorney-client
communication and privilege.

SECTION 8.5 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section
of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document
made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements
or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by
succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments
thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are also
to its permitted successors and assigns. Nothing in any representation,
warranty, covenant or condition in this Agreement shall in any way limit or
restrict the scope, applicability or meaning of any other representation,
warranty, covenant or condition set forth in this Agreement, and
each representation, warranty, covenant and condition in this Agreement shall
be given full separate and independent effect.

SECTION 8.6  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

SECTION 8.7 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents, agreements and instruments referred to herein) (a)
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and neither party is relying on any other
oral or written representation, agreement or understanding and (b) except for
the provisions of _Section 5.5_ (which are intended to benefit the
Indemnified Parties, including Indemnified Parties who or which are not
parties hereto), is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the
parties any rights or remedies; _provided_ , that, prior to the Effective
Time, US LEC shall be entitled to pursue damages on behalf of its
stockholders in the event of an intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud
by PAETEC, the Company, Merger Sub U or Merger Sub P, and PAETEC shall be
entitled to pursue damages on behalf of its stockholders in the event of
an intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud by US LEC, and each of such
rights of US LEC and PAETEC are hereby acknowledged and agreed by each of the
parties.



  

96 SECTION 8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any disputes arising out of or
related to this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws thereof.

SECTION 8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole
or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment in
violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding
two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

SECTION 8.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware and, in the absence of jurisdiction of such
court with respect to the applicable matter, any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in the event any dispute arises
out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (c) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, in the
absence of jurisdiction of such court with respect to the applicable matter, a
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware or a Delaware state court. 

SECTION 8.11 _Headings, etc_. The headings and table of contents contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be
accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by
the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Laws in an acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 8.13 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No
failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. 



 

97 SECTION 8.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF US LEC, PAETEC, THE COMPANY,
MERGER SUB U AND MERGER SUB P HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF US LEC, PAETEC, THE
COMPANY, MERGER SUB U AND MERGER SUB P IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

SECTION 8.15 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and, in the absence of jurisdiction of such court with
respect to the applicable matter, any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or in Delaware state court, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

98 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, US LEC, PAETEC, the Company, Merger Sub U and Merger Sub P

Form of Affiliate Letter Agreement

WC Acquisition Holdings Corp.

One PAETEC Plaza

600 Willowbrook Office Park

Fairport, NY 14450

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of PAETEC/US LEC, a Delaware corporation (" _PAETEC/US LEC_ "), as
the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been further advised that
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August
11, 2006 (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
by and among US LEC CORP., a Delaware corporation (" _US LEC_ "), PAETEC
CORP., a Delaware corporation (" _PAETEC_ "), WC ACQUISITION HOLDINGS CORP., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PAETEC (the " _Company_
"), WC ACQUISITION SUB U CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company (" _Merger Sub U_ "), and WC ACQUISITION SUB P
CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("
_Merger Sub P_ "), Merger Sub U and Merger Sub P will merge, respectively,
with and into US LEC and PAETEC, respectively, pursuant to which mergers each
share of Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of US LEC will be
converted into the right to receive one share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") and each share of
Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of PAETEC will be converted
into the right to receive 1.623 shares of Company Common Stock (such
transactions are referred to herein individually as the " _US LEC Merger_ "
and the " _PAETEC Merger_ ," respectively), as a result of which the holders
of US LEC Common Stock and PAETEC Common Stock will together own all of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. All terms used in this letter (the
" _Letter Agreement_ ") but not defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

I represent, warrant and covenant to the Company that in the event I receive
any Company Common Stock as a result of the PAETEC/US LEC Merger:

I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Company
Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

I have carefully read this Letter Agreement and the Merger Agreement
and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my
ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Company Common Stock to the
extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for PAETEC/US LEC.

I have been advised that the issuance of Company Common Stock to me pursuant
to the PAETEC/US LEC Merger shall be registered with the Commission under the
Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that,
since at the time the PAETEC/US LEC Merger will be submitted for a vote of
the stockholders of PAETEC/US LEC I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of
PAETEC/US LEC and the distribution by me of Company Common Stock has not been
registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
Company Common Stock issued to me in the PAETEC/US LEC Merger unless (i) such
sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii)
such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the
volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under
the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Company, or as described in a letter from the staff of the Commission
specifically issued with respect to a transaction to be engaged in by the
undersigned, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Act.

I understand that the Company is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of Company Common Stock by me or on my behalf
under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
the Companys transfer agents with respect to Company Common Stock and that
there will be placed on the certificates for Company Common Stock issued to
me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with
the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under
said act or an exemption from such registration."

I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Company Common Stock
has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with
the provisions of Rule 145, the Company reserves the right to put the
following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be
removed, at no cost to me, by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to the Companys transfer agent
removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale
will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required
by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed
from the Closing  Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two
years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under
the Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date
and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have
delivered to the Company (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the
Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are
not required for purposes of the Act or (ii) reasonably satisfactory evidence
or representations that the securities represented by such certificates are
being or have been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145 under the Act or pursuant to an effective registration
under the Act.

I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my
spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any
trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10%
beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in
any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I,
my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity
securities or of the equity interest.

It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be
of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

Execution of this Letter Agreement should not be construed as an admission on
my part that I am an "affiliate" of PAETEC/US LEC as described in the first
paragraph of this Letter Agreement or as a waiver of any rights I may have to
object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this
Letter Agreement.
