The Company (i) shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offers (other than that the Merger shall have been consummated) and make any change to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offers as may be reasonably requested by Parent so long as the Parent agrees to hold the Company harmless from any cost or expense relating to or arising from such waiver or changes and (ii) shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offers or make any changes to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offers. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Offer Documents, the Company shall not be required to amend the terms and conditions of the Debt Offers pursuant to instructions from Parent if such amendment would decrease the price per applicable Note payable in the Debt Offers, increase the Consent Condition or impose conditions to the Debt Offers in addition to those set forth in the Debt Offer Documents that are materially adverse to the tendering holders of the Notes. Parent has provided draft Debt Offer Documents to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement.

If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offers any information in or concerning the Debt Offer Documents is discovered by the Company or Parent, which information should be included in an amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents to prevent the Debt Offer Documents from containing any untrue statement of a material fact or from omitting to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be disseminated to the holders of the Notes.

  

   (d)  Parent agrees to be responsible for customary tender offer premiums in connection with the Debt Offers and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes. In addition, whether or not the Debt Offers are completed, Parent agrees to be responsible for fees and expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary, outside legal counsel or other agent retained by the Company in connection with the Debt Offers, each of whom shall be selected by mutual consent of Parent and the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), pursuant to customary arrangements and agreements between the Company and such agents, each in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company. This obligation of Parent to pay the fees and expenses set forth in the preceding sentence shall survive termination of this Agreement.

  

   (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.13_ , Parent and the Company shall comply, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to comply, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any other Law to the extent such Law is applicable in connection with the Debt Offers.

Parent will take all action reasonably necessary or advisable to prepare the prospectus, circular/notice of extraordinary general meeting and other related documentation to be dispatched to its shareholders in order to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval at the Parent Shareholder Meeting and, to the fullest extent permissible by Law, to secure the approval of its shareholders in compliance with the terms of its articles of association and applicable Law.

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  Section 8.1 _Indemnification_. 

  

   (a)  Following the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers, directors, agents and affiliates shall be entitled to indemnification (from the Escrow Amount only and only to the extent of the Escrow Amount) against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, claims, Taxes, costs and expenses suffered, sustained, or incurred (collectively, " _Losses_ ") that they may suffer, sustain, incur or become subject to arising out of, in connection with or due to (i) any inaccuracy of any representation or breach of any warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the representations and warranties made in the officers\' certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 6.2(f)_ , without giving effect, except in respect of _Section 3.6_ hereof, to any "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," or similar qualifier or qualifiers contained therein; provided, however that the representation and warranty of the Company contained in _Section 3.10_ shall not survive the Closing, (ii) Environmental Costs, (iii) any claims made by Stockholders not executing Stockholders\' Letter Agreements in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the Severance Payments, if any, paid by the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate thereof under Section 10(f) of the employment agreements between the Company and each of the officers of the Company listed on Exhibit E hereto (such Section 10(f) to be added to such employment agreements pursuant to the SVP Amendments after the date of this Agreement) (it being understood that, for purposes of this clause (iv) only, the term "Losses" shall mean solely an amount or amounts equal to one-half of the Severance Payments paid under such Section 10(f), based on the Base Salaries of such officers as in effect on the date of this Agreement). The term "Losses" shall include interest, penalties, fees and reasonable professional fees and expenses incurred in connection with any of the foregoing, including without limitation the costs of defending any claim or other proceeding covered by this indemnity, and in investigating (in response to a claim) and seeking indemnification pursuant to this _Article_ VIII, net of any insurance proceeds (net of the present value of any increase in premiums paid over the next five years attributable to such insurance recovery) or other recoveries (net of all collection and other costs incurred or attributable to such other recoveries) actually received by the Indemnified Party or its affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right to indemnification; provided, however, that the term "Losses" shall not include any amounts recovered, or recoverable, by Parent pursuant to  _Section 9.6_ hereof.

  

   (b) No indemnification shall be available under _Section 8.1(a)(i) through (iii)_  unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses under _Section 8.1(a)(i) through (iii)_ exceeds $2.0 million (the " _Deductible _ Amount"), in which case, indemnification shall be available for all Losses arising above such Deductible Amount; provided that no indemnification shall be available under _Sections 8.1(a)(i)_ and _8.1(a)(ii)_ for Losses arising from any individual item or circumstance which does not exceed $25,000, but once such $25,000 threshold is exceeded for such individual item or circumstance, indemnification shall be available for all Losses so arising from such individual item or circumstance; provided, further, that in respect of Losses which constitute Environmental Costs, the $25,000 threshold set forth above in this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall apply on a property by property (rather than an individual item or circumstance) basis (such $25,000 thresholds being " _ _de minimus__ _Thresholds_ "); provided, however, that such limitations shall not apply to any fraudulent breach of any representation or warranty. If the Losses on an individual item or circumstance or, in the case of an Environmental Cost, on a property by property basis, do not exceed the _de minimus_ Threshold, then Losses attributable to such individual item or circumstance or, in the case of an Environmental Cost, on a property by property basis, shall not be counted towards the Deductible Amount.

   (c)  The right to indemnification based on representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Effective Time, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.

  

   (d)  The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time and shall expire on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time; provided, however, that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Sections 3.5, 3.8, 3.9, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.17, 3.18, 3.19, 3.20, 3.21, 3.22 and 3.23_ shall expire on the date that is three (3) months after the Effective Time, the representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Sections 3.7 and 3.11_ shall expire on the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time, and the representation and warranty of the Company contained in _Section 3.6_ shall expire on the date that is nine (9) months after the Effective Time and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in  _Section 3.10_ shall not survive the Closing; provided further, however, that if, at any time prior to expiration of the applicable representation and warranty, any Indemnified Party delivers to the Stockholders\' Representative and the Escrow Agent a written Claim Notice as provided in  _Section 8.3(a)_ alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of such representation and warranty and asserting a claim for recovery under  _Section 8.1(a)(i)_ based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the representation or warranty underlying the claim asserted in such notice shall survive with respect to such claim only until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. All representations and warranties made by Parent, Intermediate Parent and Merger Sub shall terminate and expire at the Effective Time. Subject to the second proviso of the first sentence of this _Section 8.1(d)_ , upon the expiration of a representation or warranty, any Losses that would have been attributable to a breach of such representation or warranty shall no longer be recoverable under a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, it being understood that the non-survivability of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 3.10_ shall not effect the right to indemnification under _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_.

   

   (e)  Claims in respect of _Section 8.1(a)(ii_ ) shall be made on or prior to the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time by delivery to the Stockholders\' Representative and the Escrow Agent of a written Claim Notice as provided in _Section 8.3(a)_ alleging the existence of an Environmental Cost and asserting a claim for recovery under _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_ based on such alleged Environmental Cost, in which case the claim asserted in such notice shall survive until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

  

   (f)  Claims in respect of _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ shall be made on or prior to the date that is three (3) months after the Effective Time by delivery to the Stockholders\' Representative and the Escrow Agent of a written Claim Notice as provided in _Section 8.3(a)_ asserting a claim for recovery under  _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ in which case the claim asserted in such notice shall survive until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

  

  Section 8.2 _Releases of the Escrow Amount_. Subject to any outstanding Claims as contemplated by _Section 8.3_ hereof and the Escrow Agreement, portions of the Escrow Amount will be released pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement as follows: 

  

   (a)  Within three Business Days after the date that is six months after the Effective Time (the " _Six Month Claim Period_ "), (i) $10.0 million less an amount equal to all Claims timely made in respect of _Section 8.1(a)(ii) _ plus (ii) $6,000,000 (the " _Six Month Non-Environmental Cost Release Amount_ ") less an amount equal to (x) all Claims timely made in respect of _Section 8.1(a)(i)_ and _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ and (y) any payments made during the Six Month Claim Period in respect of _Section 8.5(c)_  and/or _Section 9.6_ hereof and _Section 5.1(d)_ and _Section 5.1(f)_ of the Escrow Agreement less (iii) an amount equal to the Top-Up Amount, if any, payable to the Stockholders\' Representative Expense Account pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_ hereof plus (iv) interest, if any, earned on the Escrow Amount during the Six Month Claim Period (net of any reimbursement to Intermediate Parent for Taxes paid pursuant to the Escrow Agreement).

  

   (b)  Within three Business Days after the date that is nine months after the Effective Time (the " _Nine Month Claim Period_ "), $6,000,000 (the " _Nine Month Non-Environmental Cost Release Amount_ ") (A) less an amount equal to (i) any Claims referred to in _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ to the extent such Claims exceed the Six Month Non-Environmental Cost Release Amount, (ii) any Claims timely made in respect of _Section 8.1(a)(i)_ and  _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ and any Claims timely made in respect of _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ subsequent to the Six Month Claim Period and prior to the conclusion of the Nine Month Claim Period, (iii) an amount equal to the Top-Up Amount, if any, payable to the Stockholders\' Representative Expense Account pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_ hereof and (iv) any payments made subsequent to the Six Month Claim Period and prior to the conclusion of the Nine Month Claim Period in respect of _Section 8.5(c)_ and/or _Section 9.6_  hereof and _Section 5.1(d)_ and _Section 5.1(f)_ of the Escrow Agreement, and (B) plus interest, if any, earned on the Escrow Amount during the period between the Six Month Claim Period and the Nine Month Claim Period (net of any reimbursement to Intermediate Parent for Taxes paid pursuant to the Escrow Agreement).

  

   (c)  Within three Business Days after the date that is twelve months after the Effective Time (the " _Twelve Month Claim Period_ "), $6,000,000 (A) less an amount equal to (i) any Claims referred to in _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ to the extent such Claims exceed the Six Month Non-Environmental Cost Release Amount and the Nine Month Non-Environmental Cost Release Amount, (ii) any Claims referred to in _Section 8.2(b)(A)(ii)_ to the extent such Claims exceed the Nine Month Non-Environmental Cost Release Amount, (iii) any Claims timely made in respect of _Section 8.1(a)(i)_ and _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ and any Claims timely made in respect of _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ subsequent to the Nine Month Claim Period and prior to the conclusion of the Twelve Month Claim Period, (iv) an amount equal to the Top-Up Amount, if any, payable to the Stockholders\' Representative Expense Account pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_  hereof and (v) any payments made subsequent to the Nine Month Claim Period and prior to the conclusion of the Twelve Month Claim Period in respect of  _Section 8.5(c)_ and/or _Section 9.6_ hereof and _Section 5.1(d)_  and _Section 5.1(f)_ of the Escrow Agreement, and (B) plus interest, if any, earned on the Escrow Amount during the period between the Nine Month Claim Period and the Twelve Month Claim Period (net of any reimbursement to Intermediate Parent for Taxes paid pursuant to the Escrow Agreement).

  Section 8.3 _Adjustment to Escrow Amount_

  

   (a)  In order to seek indemnification under _Section 8.1(a)_ , the Person seeking indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall deliver to the Stockholders\' Representative and the Escrow Agent a claim notice (a _"Claim Notice_ ") stating in reasonable detail the basis for such claim (the " _Claim_ ") and the calculation of the Losses with respect to such Claim to the extent practicable and the clause of Section 8.1(a) pursuant to which such Claim is being made.

  

   (b)  Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Stockholders\' Representative shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a response, in which the Stockholders\' Representative shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the amount claimed in the Claim Notice (in which case, the Stockholders\' Representative and Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within two days following the delivery of the response, a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to pay such full amount to the Indemnified Party from the Escrow Amount), (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive a portion of the amount claimed in the Claim Notice (in which case, the Stockholders\' Representative and Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within five days following the delivery of the response, a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to pay such amount to the Indemnified Party from the Escrow Amount), or (iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the amount claimed in the Claim Notice. In the event the Stockholders\' Representative does not deliver a response within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to receive all of the amount claimed in the Claim Notice.

  

   (c) In respect of Claims not subject to _Section 8.5_ hereof, during the 30-day period following the delivery of a response under _Sections 8.3(b)(ii) or 8.3(b)(iii)_ above, the Stockholders\' Representative and the Indemnified Party shall attempt to resolve the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved within such 30-day period, the Stockholders\' Representative or the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to submit such disputed Claim for resolution by litigation in the forum described in _Section 10.5_. Within five days of the resolution of the dispute (whether by mutual agreement or litigation), a written notice executed by the Stockholders\' Representative and Parent shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent as to what (if any) payment is to be made to Surviving Corporation or its successor or, if after the Six Month Claim Period, Nine Month Claim Period, or Twelve Month Claim Period, the Stockholders\' Representative, as applicable, from the Escrow Amount (which notice shall be consistent with the terms of the resolution of the dispute).

  

   (d) The notification and dispute resolution procedures set forth in this _Section 8.3_ also shall apply to any facts or circumstances that would be a basis for a claim for indemnification hereunder but for the fact that the Deductible Amount has not been reached. Failure of any Indemnified Person to comply with the provisions of this _Section 8.3(d)_ in respect of such facts or circumstances shall disqualify any Losses arising from or relating to such facts or circumstances from counting toward the Deductible Amount or from being the basis for a Claim for indemnification hereunder.

  

  Section 8.4 _Manner and Limitation of Indemnification of the Indemnified Parties_. 

  

   (a) The Stockholders\' Representative shall have the right to dispute any claim for indemnification, including on the grounds that (i) no breach of representation, warranty, agreement or covenant has occurred and/or (ii) the amount of any Loss set forth in any claim for indemnification exceeds a reasonable estimate of Loss with respect to the claim for indemnification.

  

   (b) All claims for indemnification shall be made only against the Escrow Amount.

  

   (c) Each claim for indemnification made by an Indemnified Party shall be made only in accordance with this _Article VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement.

  

  Section 8.5 _Third Party Claims_. The following procedures shall apply in respect of any claim, action or proceeding made, brought or initiated by any party other than the parties to this Agreement, their Subsidiaries and controlled affiliates: 

  

   (a) An Indemnified Party shall notify the Stockholders\' Representative in writing within five Business Days following the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third party giving rise to indemnity pursuant to this _Article VIII_ or within ten Business Days of the assertion of any claim against such Indemnified Party giving rise to indemnity pursuant to this  _Article VIII_ (any five or ten Business Day notification requirement shall begin to run, in the case of a claim which is amended so as to give rise to an amended claim for which indemnification is provided pursuant to this _Article VIII_ from the first day such claim is so amended), such notice to describe in reasonable detail the basis of the Indemnified Party\'s belief that such claim, action or proceeding gives rise to indemnity pursuant to this _Article VIII_. The failure to give notice as required by this _Section 8.5(a)_  in a timely fashion shall not result in a waiver of any right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Stockholders\' Representative\'s ability to defend against the event with respect to which indemnification is sought is materially and adversely affected by the failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice in a timely fashion as required by this _Section 8.5(a)_.

  

   (b) The Stockholders\' Representative shall be entitled (but not obligated) to assume the defense or settlement of any such action or proceeding, or to participate in any negotiations or proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate any claim, if it shall provide the Indemnified Parties a written acknowledgement of its liability for the indemnity against Losses relating to such claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have the sole right, with counsel of its choice, to defend, settle or otherwise dispose of in its sole discretion, any action, claim or proceeding that constitutes a Non-Controllable Claim, and the Stockholders\' Representative shall not be entitled to assume the defense thereof. If the Stockholders\' Representative assumes any such defense or settlement or any such negotiations, it timely shall pursue such defense, settlement or negotiations in good faith. If the Stockholders\' Representative fails to elect in writing within five Business Days of the notification referred to above to assume the defense, or fails to timely pursue any such defense, settlement or negotiation, the Indemnified Party may engage counsel to defend, settle or otherwise dispose of such action or proceeding; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such action, proceeding or claim without the consent or agreement of the Stockholders\' Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.)

  

   (c) In cases where the Stockholders\' Representative has assumed the defense or settlement with respect to a claim, action or proceeding giving rise to indemnity hereunder, the Stockholders\' Representative shall be entitled to assume the defense or settlement thereof with counsel of its own choosing,  _provided_ , _however_ , that: (A) the Indemnified Party (and its counsel) shall be entitled to continue to participate at its own cost (except as provided below) in any such action or proceeding or in any negotiations or proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate any such claim for which indemnification is being sought; (B) the Stockholders\' Representative shall have the right, in its reasonable discretion, to settle any such claim if such settlement involves solely money damages having a value less than the remaining amount of the non-disputed Escrow Amount pertaining to such claim, (C) except as provided in clause (B), the Stockholders\' Representative shall not be entitled to settle or compromise any such action, proceeding or claim without the consent or agreement of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (D) after written notice by the Stockholders\' Representative to the Indemnified Party (as provided above) of its election to assume control of the defense of any claim, the Stockholders\' Representative shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party hereunder for any attorneys\' fees and disbursements subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection therewith (except as provided below). In cases where the Stockholders\' Representative has assumed the defense or settlement with respect to a claim, action or proceeding giving rise to indemnity hereunder, the Stockholders\' Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement, to the extent of available funds, from the Escrow Amount for reasonable attorneys\' fees and disbursements of outside counsel and other out-of-pocket costs of the Stockholders\' Representative incurred in the defense or settlement of any such claim, action or proceeding and promptly after presenting Parent with appropriate backup substantiating any such costs or expenses, Parent and the Stockholders\' Representative shall provide the Escrow Agent with joint written instructions authorizing the Escrow Agent to release such amounts to or at the direction of the Stockholders\' Representative.

  

   (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.5_ , the reasonable attorneys\' fees and disbursements of outside counsel and other out-of pocket costs of such Indemnified Party incurred (A) relating to such Indemnified Party\'s participation in any claim, action or proceeding giving rise to indemnity for which the Indemnified Party has provided notice to the Stockholders\' Representative under this _Section 8.5_ (whether or not the Stockholders\' Representative shall have assumed the defense of such claim, action or proceeding) to the extent such participation relates to a claim or defense that the Indemnified Party has that the Stockholders\' Representative does not have, or relates to a claim or defense as to which the Stockholders\' Representative may have a conflict of interest, or (B) relating to discovery against or testimony of such Indemnified Party and for participation of such Indemnified Party\'s own counsel in such discovery and testimony, in each case, shall be borne from the Escrow Amount.

  

   (e) In the event Parent elects to defend, settle or otherwise dispose of a Non-Controllable Claim, it shall pursue such defense, settlement or other disposition in good faith. Promptly upon the reasonable request of the Stockholders\' Representative, but no more frequently than once a calendar quarter, Parent shall provide the Stockholders\' Representative with a report summarizing any material developments in any Non-Controllable Claim that is being defended by Parent and shall make available a designated representative to consult with or otherwise discuss any such Non-Controllable Claim with the Stockholders\' Representative. Nothing herein shall be deemed to require Parent to (A) make any disclosure that, in its judgment, could prejudice its position or waive any privilege or (B) take or refrain from taking any action; it being understood that the defense, settlement or other disposition of any Non-Controllable Claim shall be conducted in Parent\'s sole discretion.

  

   (f)  Parent shall give the Stockholders\' Representative prompt written notice of any determination by Parent that a Claim is a Non-Controllable Claim.

  

ARTICLE IX

  

THE STOCKHOLDERS\' REPRESENTATIVE

  

  Section 9.1 _Appointment of the Stockholders\' Representative_. By virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Stockholders, from and after the Effective Time, the Stockholders\' Representative shall act as agent and attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Stockholders for purposes of taking action or receiving notice pursuant to  _Article VIII_ hereof, the Escrow Agreement and  _Schedule 1.1(a)_ hereto, to taking any and all actions and making any and all decisions required or permitted to be taken by it under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ hereto, and to exercising such rights, power and authority as are incidental hereto (including the right, power and authority to retain attorneys, accountants and other advisors to assist it in the performance of its duties hereunder). The Stockholders\' Representative shall have the ability and power to execute and deliver all instruments, certificates and other documents of every kind incident to the foregoing and with all right, power and authority to act on behalf of the Stockholders in connection herewith. Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Stockholders\' Representative on all matters relating to _Article VIII_ of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ hereto. If the then-current Stockholders\' Representative shall resign its position or be unable to fulfill its responsibilities as agent of the Stockholders, then the then-current Stockholders\' Representative shall as soon as practicable appoint a successor representative reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Any such successor shall become the "Stockholders\' Representative" for purposes of _Article VIII_ of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ hereto; and no such resignation of the then-current Stockholders\' Representative shall be effective as to the then-current Stockholders\' Representative until the new Stockholders\' Representative shall accept such appointment. 

  

  Section 9.2 _Liability of the Stockholders\' Representative_. By virtue of the Merger, each Stockholder shall be deemed to have waived any claims it may have or assert, including those (on its behalf and on behalf of its affiliates) that may arise in the future, against the Stockholders\' Representative for, and agree that the Stockholders\' Representative shall have no liability for, any action or inaction taken or not taken by the Stockholders\' Representative in connection with its capacity as the Stockholders\' Representative, except to the extent that such action or inaction shall have been held by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders\' Representative may consult with legal counsel and may rely on, and shall be fully protected in reliance on, any such advice of counsel. 

  

  Section 9.3 _Fees and Expenses of the Stockholders\' Representative_. 

  

   (a) The Stockholders\' Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be entitled to the payment of all of its reasonable and documented post-Closing out-of-pocket expenses incurred (including the costs, expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with retaining outside counsel) in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder and pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, in each case as provided in this _Section 9.3_ , to the extent of the Stockholders\' Representative Amount and any available Top-Up Amount payments.

  

   (b) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to a bank designated by the Stockholders\' Representative, in cash, the Stockholders\' Representative Amount to be available from time to time to the Stockholders\' Representative solely in connection with the provisions of _Section 9.3(a)_  hereof (the _"Stockholders\' Representative Expense Account_ "). The Stockholders\' Representative shall maintain the Stockholders\' Representative Expense Account in a segregated account. The Stockholders\' Representative shall be responsible for maintaining a complete and accurate itemized accounting of all expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing and shall provide promptly a copy of same to any Common Stockholder from time to time upon the request of such Common Stockholder.

  

   (c) From time to time as funds would otherwise be releasable pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to or at the direction of the Stockholders\' Representative, the Stockholders\' Representative shall be permitted to cause to be retained from amounts that would otherwise be distributed to the Stockholders hereunder, and deposited into the Stockholders\' Representative Expense Account, upon reasonable advance written notice to the Escrow Agent and Parent, such additional amounts (the " _Top-Up Amount_ ") as the Stockholders\' Representative shall determine in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or advisable to provide sufficient funds to permit it to carry out its obligations under this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholders\' Representative shall only be permitted to cause to be retained such amounts as would not cause the Stockholders\' Representative Expense Account to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000).

  

   (d) The Stockholders\' Representative shall deliver to the Stockholders, including, as applicable, the Stockholders\' Representative, in accordance with their respective aggregate Pro Rata Share, any amount of the Stockholders\' Representative Expense Account not applied to the payment of any such costs and expenses as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of the later of (i) the termination of the Escrow Agreement upon the final distribution therefrom, and (ii) no further amounts being payable with respect to the Common Stock Deferred Payment.

  

  Section 9.4 _Capacity of the Stockholders\' Representative_. The obligations of the Stockholders\' Representative hereunder are obligations strictly in its capacity as agent and attorney-in-fact of the Stockholders. 

  

  Section 9.5 _Claims Determined in Favor of the Stockholders\' Representative_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if the Stockholders\' Representative shall (a) dispute any Claim for indemnification hereunder and, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be finally adjudicated that the Indemnified Parties shall not have been entitled to indemnification therefor, or (b) dispute any calculation or other matter with respect to the Common Stock Deferred Payment or any matter under the Escrow Agreement and, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as the case may be, such dispute shall be finally adjudicated against Parent or any applicable Indemnified Party, then any costs or expenses incurred by the Stockholders\' Representative in connection with the defense or settlement of any such Claim, or in disputing the Indemnified Parties\' entitlement to indemnification therefor, or in disputing any calculation or other matter with respect to the Common Stock Deferred Payment or any matter under the Escrow Agreement shall, in each case, be reimbursed to the Stockholders\' Representative by Parent within three (3) Business Days of the Stockholders\' Representative\'s demand therefor. 

  

  Section 9.6 _Claims Determined in Favor of Parent_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if the Stockholders\' Representative shall dispute any calculation or other matter with respect to the Common Stock Deferred Payment or any matter under the Escrow Agreement and, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as the case may be, such dispute shall be finally adjudicated against the Stockholders\' Representative, then any costs or expenses incurred by Parent in connection therewith shall be reimbursed to Parent from the Escrow Amount within three (3) Business Days of Parent\'s demand therefor.

   (a)  In accordance with the provisions of _Section 8.3_ of the Merger Agreement, Parent shall be permitted to deliver to the Stockholders Representative and the Escrow Agent one or more written claim notices (each, a _"Claim Notice_ ") (such notice to be given in accordance with _Section 6._ 1 hereof) stating in reasonable detail the basis for such claim (the " _Claim_ "), the calculation of the Losses with respect to such Claim to the extent practicable and the clause of _Section 8.1(a)_ of the Merger Agreement pursuant to which such Claim is being made. Promptly after its receipt of a Claims Notice, the Escrow Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to forward a copy thereof to the Stockholders Representative. 

  

   (b)  For a period of 30 days after the delivery of a Claim Notice to the Stockholders Representative and the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall make no payment pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Stockholders Representative to make such payment with respect to such Claim. After the expiration of such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent may make payments in accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_ hereof, _provided_ , _however_ , that no such payment may be made with respect to any Claim set forth in such Claim Notice to the extent that the Stockholders Representative shall object to such payment in a written statement delivered to the Escrow Agent within such 30-day period. A duplicate copy of any such statement shall be delivered to Parent at the same time it is delivered to the Escrow Agent. 

  

   (c)  If the Stockholders Representative shall object in writing in respect of any Claim or Claims made in any Claim Notice within such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent shall make no payment with respect to any such disputed Claim or Claims until the Escrow Agent shall have received a final determination as to the validity and amount of any Claim or Claims in such Claim Notice set forth in either (i) a memorandum prepared and signed by the Stockholders Representative and Parent (a " _Joint Memorandum_ ") or (ii) an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, that shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent, accompanied by an opinion of counsel for the party delivering such order addressed to the Escrow Agent to the effect that such order is final and nonappealable (an _"Order and Opinion_ "). The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such Joint Memorandum or Order and Opinion, as applicable, and shall make payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith and with _Section 3.3(d)_ hereof. 

  

   (d)  Upon the expiration of the 30-day period (in cases covered by _Section 3.3(b)_ hereof) or the receipt of a copy of a Joint Memorandum or an Order and Opinion (in cases covered by _Sections 3.3(c)_ hereof), the Escrow Agent shall deliver to Parent out of the Escrow Amount, an amount of cash equal to the amount specified in the Claim Notice (in cases covered by _Section 3.3(b)_ hereof), or in a Joint Memorandum or an Order and Opinion, as the case may be (in cases covered by _Section 3.3(c)_ hereof). In addition, portions of the Escrow Amount shall be distributed to the Stockholders or the Stockholders Representative, as the case may be, from time to time as a result of the final settlement of Claims as evidenced by the receipt of a copy of a Joint Memorandum or an Order and Opinion, and any funds remaining in the Escrow Fund following the end of the Twelve Month Claim Period shall be distributed as and when Claims are finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement and this Escrow Agreement. 

  

   (e)  In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if Parent delivers to the Escrow Agent a Joint Memorandum or an Order and Opinion resolving a dispute against the Stockholders Representative in accordance with Section 9.6 of the Merger Agreement, then within three (3) Business Days of delivery of such Joint Memorandum or an Order and Opinion the Escrow Agent shall pay from the Escrow Amount to an account designated by an authorized signatory of Parent such amount as is set forth in such Joint Memorandum or an Order and Opinion. 

  

   (f)  In addition, from time to time Parent and the Stockholders Representative may deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to release certain amounts from the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent agrees to, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of any such joint written instructions, pay amounts from the Escrow Fund in accordance with any such joint written instructions to the extent of funds available in the Escrow Fund.

 ESCROW AGENT

  

  Section 5.1 _The Escrow Agent_. 

  

   (a)  Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or by joint written instructions signed by an authorized signatory of both Parent and the Stockholders Representative, the Escrow Agent shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the Escrow Fund, except pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

   (b)  The duties and obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be determined solely by this Agreement (and, solely to the extent specifically incorporated by reference herein, the Merger Agreement), and the Escrow Agent shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants shall be read into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent. 

  

   (c)  In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely without any investigation into the underlying facts upon any certificate, statement, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, document, instrument, signature or other paper document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and signed by any party or parties hereto or an authorized officer or agent thereof, and shall not be required to investigate the truth or accuracy of any statement contained in any such document or instrument. The Escrow Agent may assume that any Person purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement has been duly authorized to do so. 

  

   (d)  Parent and the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders), jointly and severally, shall be liable for and shall reimburse and indemnify Escrow Agent and hold Escrow Agent (and its officers, directors, employees and agents) harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, costs and disbursements) that the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement and its performance hereunder or in connection herewith, except to the extent such loss, liability, damage or expense arises from its willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence as adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, in seeking reimbursement or indemnification from the Stockholders Representative hereunder, the Escrow Agent (or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents) may make a claim against, and shall only be reimbursed from, the Escrow Fund, and, in no event shall the Stockholders Representative be liable for any claims in its individual capacity. This _Section 5.1(d)_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent. 

  

   (e)  The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to give the property held in escrow by it hereunder any greater degree of care than it gives its own similar property. 

  

   (f) The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent are set forth on _Schedule B_  attached hereto. The Escrow Agents annual fee shall be payable upon the execution of this Agreement and thereafter on each anniversary date of this Agreement. The first annual fee payable to the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be paid to the Escrow Agent by Parent. Thereafter the annual fee shall be paid one-half by Parent and one-half by the Stockholders (payable solely from the Escrow Fund). The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Escrow Agent in connection with this Agreement. All such expenses, disbursements and advances, and any fees in addition to the annual fee, payable to the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be paid to the Escrow Agent one-half by Parent and one-half by the Stockholders (payable solely from the Escrow Fund). The Escrow Agent shall give the Stockholders Representative and Parent prompt written notice of all payments made to the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this _Section 5.1(f)_.

   (g)  The Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances, including reasonable fees of outside counsel and of all persons not regularly in its employ, if any, incurred or made by it in connection with the preparation of this Agreement or any other documents executed in connection herewith and the carrying out of its duties under this Agreement. All such fees and expenses shall be paid to the Escrow Agent one-half by Parent and one-half on behalf of the Stockholders (payable solely from the Escrow Fund). The obligations of Parent and the Stockholders under this _Section 5.1(g)_ to compensate the Escrow Agent and to pay or reimburse the Escrow Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Agreement or the earlier resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent. 

  

   (h)  The Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, resign and terminate its position hereunder at any time following thirty (30) Business Days written notice to the parties to this Agreement. Any such resignation shall terminate all obligations and duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder. The Stockholders Representative and Parent may at any time jointly remove the Escrow Agent by giving twenty (20) Business Days written notice signed by each of them to the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent shall resign or be removed, a successor Escrow Agent, which shall be a bank or trust company having its principal executive offices in the United States and having assets in excess of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000), and which shall be mutually agreeable to Parent and the Stockholders Representative and appointed by written instrument executed by the Stockholders Representative and Parent and delivered to the Escrow Agent and to such successor Escrow Agent and, thereupon, the resignation or removal of the predecessor Escrow Agent shall become effective and such successor Escrow Agent, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all right, title and interest to all cash and property held hereunder of such predecessor Escrow Agent, and such predecessor Escrow Agent shall, on the written request of an authorized signatory of both the Stockholders Representative and Parent, execute and deliver to such successor Escrow Agent all the right, title and interest hereunder in and to the Escrow Fund of such predecessor Escrow Agent and all other rights hereunder of such predecessor Escrow Agent. If no successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed within twenty (20) Business Days of a notice of resignation by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agents sole responsibility shall thereafter be to hold the Escrow Fund until the earlier of (i) its receipt of designation of a successor Escrow Agent in a joint written instruction by the Stockholders Representative and Parent and (ii) termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. If no successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed within twenty (20) Business Days of the Escrow Agents delivery of a notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such appointment, or other appropriate relief. Any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the parties to this Agreement. 

  

   (i)  Within five (5) Business Days following the end of each calendar month prior to termination of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent will supply an official account statement to the Parent and the Stockholders Representative setting forth (a) the then current balance of the Escrow Fund, (b) the details of each transaction in the account during such month, and (c) a description of the amount and type of the individual investment positions in the Escrow Fund as of such time. 

  

   (j)  The Escrow Agent does not have any interest in the Escrow Account but is serving as escrow holder only and having only possession thereof. Upon request, the Escrow Agent shall be paid or reimbursed for any transfer taxes related to the Escrow Fund incurred in connection herewith, and Parent and the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders), jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from any amounts that the Escrow Agent is obligated to pay in the way of such taxes, with responsibility for such payment, reimbursement, indemnity or holding the Escrow Agent harmless to be borne by Parent and by the Stockholders Representative; provided, however, in seeking reimbursement or indemnification from the Stockholders Representative hereunder, the Escrow Agent may make a claim against, and shall only be reimbursed from, the Escrow Fund, and, in no event shall the Stockholders Representative be liable for any claims in its individual capacity. If necessary under applicable law, any payments of income from the Escrow Fund shall be subject to withholding regulations then in force with respect to U.S. taxes. This _Section 5.1(j)_ and _Section 5.1(g)_ shall survive notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement or the resignation of the Escrow Agent.

   (l)  The Escrow Agent shall not be called upon to advise any party as to the wisdom in selling or retaining, or taking or refraining from taking any action with respect to, any securities or other property deposited hereunder. 

  

   (m)  In the event of any disagreement between the other parties hereto resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with the Escrow Fund, or in the event that the Escrow Agent in good faith is in doubt as to what action it should take hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to retain such portion of the Escrow Fund that is subject to such adverse claims or demands until the Escrow Agent shall have received (i) a final nonappealable order of a court having jurisdiction directing delivery of the Escrow Fund presented to the Escrow Agent by the prevailing party, or (ii) a written agreement executed by the parties hereto (other than the Escrow Agent) directing delivery of the Escrow Fund, in which event the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Fund in accordance with such order, judgment or agreement. Any court order shall be accompanied by a legal opinion of counsel for the presenting party reasonably satisfactory to the Escrow Agent to the effect that said order or judgment is final and nonappealable. The Escrow Agent shall act on such court order or judgment and legal opinion without further question.

  

   (n)  The Escrow Agent shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with any direction of Parent and the Stockholders Representative given under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel of its selection in the event of any dispute or question as to the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder. 

  

   (o)  None of the provisions of this Agreement shall require the Escrow Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise to incur any liability, financial or otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds, or indemnity satisfactory to it against such risk or liability, is not assured to it. 

  

   (p)  Whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Agreement the Escrow Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be provided or established prior to taking or suffering any action to be taken hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by an authorized signatory of both Parent and the Stockholders Representative and delivered to the Escrow Agent, and such certificate, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent, shall be full warrant to the Escrow Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Agreement upon the faith thereof as adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

   (q)  In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for the selection of the investment of the Escrow Fund as provided in _Article IV_ or for investment losses incurred thereon. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability in respect of losses incurred as a result of the liquidation of any investment prior to its stated maturity or the failure of Parent and the Stockholders Representative to give timely written liquidation direction. 

  

   (r)  The Escrow Agent may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or indirectly or by or through agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees appointed with due care, and shall not be responsible for any bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence on part of any agent, attorney, custodian or nominee so appointed as adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

   (s)  Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the business of the Escrow Agent, shall be the successor of the Escrow Agent hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper with any party hereto or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto except where an instrument of transfer or assignment is required by law to effect such succession, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, so long as such successor entity shall be a bank or trust company having its principal executive offices in the United States having assets in excess of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000). 

  

   (t)  Each of the parties (for itself and any person or entity claiming through it) hereby (i) releases, waives, discharges and exculpates Escrow Agent for any action taken or omitted under this Agreement, except to the extent caused by the Escrow Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, and (ii) covenants not to sue the Escrow Agent for any action taken or omitted under this Agreement, except to the extent caused by the Escrow Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. 

  

   (u)  The Escrow Agent shall be neither responsible for or under, nor chargeable with knowledge of, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document executed between or among the parties hereto, except as may be specifically provided in Exhibit A attached hereto. This Agreement sets forth all of the obligations of the Escrow Agent, and no additional obligations shall be implied from the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document. 

  

   (v)  The Escrow Agent shall invest the property held in escrow in the manner set forth in _Article IV_ , even though Citibank or its affiliates may receive a benefit or profit therefrom. The Escrow Agent and its affiliates are authorized to act as counterparty, principal, agent, broker or dealer while purchasing or selling investments as specified herein. 

  

   The parties to this agreement acknowledge that non deposit investment products are not obligations of, or guaranteed by, Citibank/Citigroup or any of its affiliates; are not FDIC insured; and are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Only deposits in the United States are subject to FDIC insurance. 

  

   (w)  In the event funds transfer instructions are given (other than in writing at the time of execution of this Agreement), whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone callback to Parent and the Stockholders Representative, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. To assure accuracy of the instructions it receives, the Escrow Agent may record such callbacks. If the Escrow Agent is unable to verify the instructions, or is not reasonably satisfied with the verification it receives, it will not execute the instruction until all issues are resolved. The persons and telephone numbers for callbacks may be changed only in writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. The parties agree to notify the Escrow Agent of any errors, delays or other problems within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving notification that a transaction has been executed. If the transaction is determined to have been was delayed or erroneously executed as a result of the Escrow Agents error, the Escrow Agents sole obligation, unless such transaction was delayed or erroneously executed as a result of the Escrow Agents bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence as adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, is to pay or refund such amounts as may be required by applicable law. In no event, other than as a result of bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence on part of the Escrow Agent as adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall the Escrow Agent be responsible for any incidental or consequential damages or expenses in connection with the instruction. Any claim for interest payable will be at the Escrow Agents published savings account rate in effect in New York, New York.

   (y)  The Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability for not performing any act or fulfilling any obligation hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond its control (including any provision of any present or future law or regulation or any act of any governmental authority, any act of God or war or terrorism, or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire services or any electronic communication facility). 

  

   (z)  No printed or other material in any language, including prospectuses, notices, reports and promotional material that mentions "Citibank" by name or the rights, powers, or duties of the Escrow Agent under this Agreement shall be issued by any other parties hereto, or on such partys behalf, without the prior written consent of the Escrow Agent.

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that state. All actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York, provided, however, that if such federal court does not have jurisdiction over such action, such action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York.

In addition, the Stockholder understands that concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company owning approximately 61.5% of the outstanding Company Common Stock and 68.3% of the outstanding Company Preferred Stock (the " _Majority Stockholders_ "), by written consent, approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including without limitation, the approval of the Merger. Capitalized terms used without definition in this letter agreement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. 

  

  The Stockholder confirms its agreement with Parent, as follows: 

  

  1. _Voting Agreement_. During the term of this letter agreement, the Stockholder hereby agrees to vote all the Shares (as defined in paragraph 6(a)) owned by the Stockholder and any other capital stock of the Company that the Stockholder becomes entitled to vote, whether through contract, purchase, exercise of an option or otherwise (" _Additional Shares_ ") to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement (and any subsequent amendments thereto that do not effect the consideration payable to the Stockholder or adversely effect the Stockholder in any other manner), the Merger and all other agreements and actions to be undertaken in connection therewith, at every meeting of stockholders, if any, of the Company, and at every adjournment thereof (or by written consent in lieu of a meeting), at which such matters are submitted for the consideration and vote of stockholders of the Company. The Stockholder hereby further agrees that it will not vote (or give a written consent with respect to) any Shares or Additional Shares in favor of the approval of (i) any proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, business combination, tender offer, sale of substantially all of the Companys assets, sale of shares of capital stock or similar transactions involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) any reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, winding up of the Company or any other similar extraordinary transaction involving the Company, or (iii) any corporate action the consummation of which would frustrate the purposes, or prevent or delay the consummation, of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Except as set forth in the previous two sentences of this paragraph 1, the Stockholder shall not be restricted from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this letter agreement shall be construed as creating any obligations of, or restrictions on, any officers, directors, employees or other representatives of such Stockholder in their capacities as officers, directors and/or employees of the Company. 

  

  2. _Revocation of Prior Proxies_. The Stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to the Stockholders Shares and/or Additional Shares with respect to the matters set forth in paragraph 1.

Any such successor shall become the "Stockholders Representative" for purposes of Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ to the Merger Agreement.

In addition, the Stockholder understands that concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company owning approximately 61.5% of the outstanding Company Common Stock and 68.3% of the outstanding Company Preferred Stock (the " _Majority Stockholders_ "), by written consent, approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including without limitation, the approval of the Merger. Capitalized terms used without definition in this letter agreement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. 

  

  The Stockholder confirms its agreement with Parent, as follows: 

  

  1. _Voting Agreement_. During the term of this letter agreement, the Stockholder hereby agrees to vote all the Shares (as defined in paragraph 6(a)) owned by the Stockholder and any other capital stock of the Company that the Stockholder becomes entitled to vote, whether through contract, purchase, exercise of an option or otherwise (" _Additional Shares_ ") to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement (and any subsequent amendments thereto that do not effect the consideration payable to the Stockholder or adversely effect the Stockholder in any other manner), the Merger and all other agreements and actions to be undertaken in connection therewith, at every meeting of stockholders, if any, of the Company, and at every adjournment thereof (or by written consent in lieu of a meeting), at which such matters are submitted for the consideration and vote of stockholders of the Company. The Stockholder hereby further agrees that it will not vote (or give a written consent with respect to) any Shares or Additional Shares in favor of the approval of (i) any proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, business combination, tender offer, sale of substantially all of the Companys assets, sale of shares of capital stock or similar transactions involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) any reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, winding up of the Company or any other similar extraordinary transaction involving the Company, or (iii) any corporate action the consummation of which would frustrate the purposes, or prevent or delay the consummation, of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Except as set forth in the previous two sentences of this paragraph 1, the Stockholder shall not be restricted from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this letter agreement shall be construed as creating any obligations of, or restrictions on, the Stockholder or any of its officers, directors, employees or other representatives in its or their capacities as officers, directors and/or employees of the Company. 

  

  2. _Revocation of Prior Proxies_. The Stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to the Stockholders Shares and/or Additional Shares with respect to the matters set forth in paragraph 1. 

  

  3. _Waiver of Appraisal Rights_. The Stockholder hereby agrees not to exercise her, his or its appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or other relevant provisions with respect to the Merger, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.

Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Stockholders Representative on all matters relating to Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ to the Merger Agreement. If the Stockholders Representative shall resign its position or be unable to fulfill its responsibilities as agent of the Company stockholders, then Phoenix Rental Partners, LLC shall, within ten days after a request by Parent, appoint a successor representative. Any such successor shall become the "Stockholders Representative" for purposes of Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ to the Merger Agreement. If for any reason there is no Stockholders Representative at any time, all references herein to the Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to refer to Baupost Capital, L.L.C.

In addition, the Stockholder understands that concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company owning approximately 61.5% of the outstanding Company Common Stock and 68.3% of the outstanding Company Preferred Stock (the " _Majority Stockholders_ "), by written consent, approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including without limitation, the approval of the Merger. Capitalized terms used without definition in this letter agreement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. 

  

  The Stockholder confirms its agreement with Parent, as follows: 

  

  1. _Voting Agreement_. During the term of this letter agreement, the Stockholder hereby agrees to vote all the Shares (as defined in paragraph 6(a)) owned by the Stockholder and any other capital stock of the Company that the Stockholder becomes entitled to vote, whether through contract, purchase, exercise of an option or otherwise (" _Additional Shares_ ") to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement (and any subsequent amendments thereto that do not effect the consideration payable to the Stockholder or adversely effect the Stockholder in any other manner), the Merger and all other agreements and actions to be undertaken in connection therewith, at every meeting of stockholders, if any, of the Company, and at every adjournment thereof (or by written consent in lieu of a meeting), at which such matters are submitted for the consideration and vote of stockholders of the Company. The Stockholder hereby further agrees that it will not vote (or give a written consent with respect to) any Shares or Additional Shares in favor of the approval of (i) any proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, business combination, tender offer, sale of substantially all of the Companys assets, sale of shares of capital stock or similar transactions involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) any reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, winding up of the Company or any other similar extraordinary transaction involving the Company, or (iii) any corporate action the consummation of which would frustrate the purposes, or prevent or delay the consummation, of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Except as set forth in the previous two sentences of this paragraph 1, the Stockholder shall not be restricted from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company.

  2. _Revocation of Prior Proxies_. The Stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to the Stockholders Shares and/or Additional Shares with respect to the matters set forth in paragraph 1.

This also includes a release by each Stockholder Releaser of Releasees of any claims for alleged physical or personal injury and emotional distress relating to or arising out of the Stockholders employment with the Company or any of its affiliates prior to the Stockholders execution of this letter agreement. This release and waiver does not apply to: (i) any liability or obligation with respect to the Stockholders right to receive any of the Common Stock Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration; (ii) any rights to enforce the terms of this letter agreement or the Merger Agreement or other documents entered into in connection therewith, (iii) any agreement entered into after the date hereof, (iv) any right to indemnification now existing under the charter or bylaws of the Company or under or pursuant to any contract or agreement in existence prior to the date hereof, including without limitation the any director indemnification agreement to which the Stockholder is a party and the Merger Agreement, (v) any claims arising from events occurring after the date the Stockholder executes this letter agreement and (vi) any claims arising under any employment agreement, change of control agreement, severance arrangement or agreement between the Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Company and/or its affiliates on the other hand.

Nothing in this letter agreement is intended to reflect any partys belief that, if the Stockholder is a natural person, the Stockholders waiver of claims under ADEA is invalid or unenforceable, it being the intent of the parties that such claims are waived.

Attention: Ian Robson

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

  Each of the undersigned (each, a " _Stockholder_ ") understands that Ashtead Group plc, a company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (" _Parent_ "), Sunbelt Rentals, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Parent (" _Intermediate Parent_ "), Neptune Ventures Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and NationsRent Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), are, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this letter agreement by such Stockholder, entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (including the Exhibits and Schedules attached thereto, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), in which (i) all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") (including all outstanding restricted shares of Company Common Stock, which shall become vested in connection with the Merger, and other than shares issued and held in the Companys treasury) shall be converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Cash Consideration, the Escrow Fund, if any, as may be distributed in accordance with the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Common Stock Deferred Payment and the amount remaining, if any, in the Stockholders Representative Expense Account, as it may be distributed in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, in each case, as determined in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and, additionally, in the case of the Escrow Fund, with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and (ii) all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ ") (other than any such shares issued and held in the Companys treasury) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash as determined in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Concurrently with the execution of this letter agreement, the Stockholders, collectively being the holders of approximately 61.5% of the outstanding Company Common Stock and 68.3% of the outstanding Company Preferred Stock, are executing a written consent (the  _"Written Consent_ ") approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including without limitation, the Merger. Capitalized terms used without definition in this letter agreement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. 

  

  Each Stockholder confirms its agreement with Parent, as follows: 

  

  1. _Voting Agreement; No Revocation of Written Consent; Bond Tenders_. (a) During the term of this letter agreement, each Stockholder hereby agrees to vote all the Shares (as defined in paragraph 6(a)) owned by such Stockholder and any other capital stock of the Company that such Stockholder becomes entitled to vote, whether through contract, purchase, exercise of an option or otherwise (" _Additional Shares_ ") to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement (and any subsequent amendments thereto that do not effect the consideration payable to such Stockholder or adversely effect such Stockholder in any other manner), the Merger and all other agreements and actions to be undertaken in connection therewith, at every meeting of stockholders, if any, of the Company, and at every adjournment thereof (or by written consent in lieu of a meeting), at which such matters are submitted for the consideration and vote of stockholders of the Company. Each Stockholder hereby further agrees that it will not vote (or give a written consent with respect to) any Shares or Additional Shares in favor of the approval of (i) any proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, business combination, tender offer, sale of substantially all of the Companys assets, sale of shares of capital stock or similar transactions involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) any reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, winding up of the Company or any other similar extraordinary transaction involving the Company, or (iii) any corporate action the consummation of which would frustrate the purposes, or prevent or delay the consummation, of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Each Stockholder expressly agrees that it shall not revoke its consent approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including without limitation, the Merger, such consent evidenced by such Stockholders execution of the Written Consent. Except as set forth in the previous three sentences of this paragraph 1(a), no Stockholder shall be restricted from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this letter agreement shall require any Stockholder to acquire Additional Shares. Nothing in this letter agreement shall be construed as creating any obligations of, or restrictions on, any officers, directors, employees or other representatives of such Stockholder in their capacities as officers, directors and/or employees of the Company. 

  

   (b)  Any of the Companys 9 1/2% Senior Notes due 2015 or 9 1/2% Senior Secured Notes due 2010 (collectively, the " _Company Notes_ ") that are owned or held of record by such Stockholder shall be tendered and consent shall be given pursuant to the Companys Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement for the Company Notes (the " _Company Tender Offer_ ") within three (3) business days of the commencement of, and upon the terms first presented in, the Company Tender Offer. Such Stockholder also agrees not to withdraw such tender or revoke such consent during the term of the Company Tender Offer. 

  

  2. _Revocation of Prior Proxies_. Each Stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to the Stockholders Shares and/or Additional Shares with respect to the matters set forth in paragraph 1(a).

  4. _Appointment of Stockholders  Representative_. (a) Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably agrees to the appointment of Baupost Capital, L.L.C. (the " _Stockholders  Representative_") as its agent and attorney-in-fact for purposes of taking action with respect to Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ to the Merger Agreement and consents to the taking by the Stockholders Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by it under the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ to the Merger Agreement and to exercise such rights, power and authority, as are incidental thereto (including the right, power and authority to retain attorneys, accountants and other advisors to assist it in the performance of its duties thereunder). Each Stockholder agrees that the Stockholders Representative shall have the ability and power to execute and deliver all instruments, certificates and other documents of every kind incident to the foregoing and with all right, power and authority to act on its behalf in connection therewith. Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Stockholders Representative on all matters relating to Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ to the Merger Agreement. If the Stockholders Representative shall resign its position or be unable to fulfill its responsibilities as agent of the Company stockholders, then Phoenix Rental Partners, LLC shall, within ten days after a request by Parent, appoint a successor representative. Any such successor shall become the "Stockholders Representative" for purposes of Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ to the Merger Agreement.

Exhibit E

  

Form of SVP Amendment

  

Exhibit E

  

FORM OF 
 AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

  

  This Amendment to Employment Agreement ("Amendment") is hereby entered into as of July __, 2006 by and among NationsRent Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and [William Stewart] [Francis X. Hassis] [Timothy C. Stommel] (the "Executive"). 

  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  

  WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive entered into that certain Employment Agreement dated as of ____________, 200_, as presently in effect (the "Employment Agreement"); and 

  

  WHEREAS, the Company (as authorized by its Board of Directors) and the Executive desire to amend certain provisions of the Employment Agreement; 

  

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants and undertakings contained herein, and for such other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Amendment hereby agree as follows: 

  

  1. _Amendment to Section 10 of the Employment Agreement_. Section 10 of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following new Section 10(f) thereto and relettering the current Section 10(f) to Section 10(g): 

      |  "(f) _Additional Employee Termination Right_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, following a
Change of Control, for a period commencing on the six-calendar month
anniversary of such Change of Control and ending on the thirty-first day
prior to the one-year anniversary of such Change of Control (e.g., if the
Change of Control occurs on August 24, 2006, such period shall run from
February 24, 2007 through July 25, 2007, inclusive), the Executive shall have
the right, upon not less than 30-days prior written notice, to terminate his
employment hereunder for any reason whatsoever (or for no reason)
by delivering to the Company written notice of such election to terminate
his employment hereunder, such termination to be effective on the date thirty
days after the date of such written notice (or, if not a business day, the
first business day thereafter). Upon the Executive exercising such right,
then, neither the Executive nor his beneficiary or estate shall have any
further rights or claims against the Company under this Agreement or
otherwise, except the Accrued Rights, which shall be paid to the Executive
immediately upon the effectiveness of such termination, and the Severance
Payments, which shall be paid to the Executive immediately upon the
effectiveness of such termination;  _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of this Section 10(f) only, Severance Payments will equal 200% of
the Executives Base Salary as in effect on July __, 2006, the date of this
Amendment. In consideration for the Severance Payments, the Executive agrees
to execute a release releasing the Company and its Affiliates (as defined in
Section 10(c) above) from all actions, claims, demands, causes of action,
obligations, damages, liabilities, expenses and controversies of any nature,
excluding those arising in connection with the enforcement of Executives
indemnification rights. In addition, the Executives right to receive any
Severance Payments shall be subject to the prior receipt by the Company of an
executed acknowledgment by the Executive, in a form satisfactory to the
Company, of his continuing obligations to the Company under Sections 11 and
12 of this Agreement, which obligations under Sections 12(a), (b) and (c)
shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, survive
for a period equal to the Non-Competition Period (as defined in Section 12(b)
below). For purposes of this Section 10(f), the first day of the Executives
right to terminate his employment under this Section 10(f) shall commence at
9:00 a.m. New York local time on such day and the last day of the Executives
right to terminate his employment under this Section 10(f) shall terminate at
5:00 p.m. New York local time on such day (or, if such day is not a business
day, the first business day thereafter). Additionally, if a Change of Control
shall have no corresponding six-calendar month anniversary, the calculation
of the period of Executives right to terminate his employment under this
Section 10(f) shall be based on the first business day of the calendar month
occurring after what would otherwise be the six-calendar month anniversary of
such Change of Control, as if such first business day were the six-calendar
month anniversary of such Change of Control."   
---|--- 
   
  

  2. _Amendment to Section 26 of the Employment Agreement_. Section 26 of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows: 

  

  "SECTION 26. _Survival_. The provisions of Sections 5(e), 9, 10(e), 10(f), 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 22 shall survive termination of this Agreement or termination of the employment of the Executive for any reason. 

  

  3. _Effectiveness_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it is agreed that this Amendment is binding upon the parties hereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) the respective rights of the parties hereto shall become effective immediately after the consummation, if any, of the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July __, 2006 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") by and among Ashtead Group plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, Sunbelt Rentals, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Athena, Neptune Ventures Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Saturn , and the Company; and (ii) upon the consummation of such merger, if any, a "Change of Control" will be deemed to have occurred on the date of such consummation for the purposes of Section 10(f) of the Employment Agreement being added hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, if the merger shall fail, for any reason, to be consummated, this Amendment shall not be effective and shall be null and void. 

  

  4. _Governing Law_. This Amendment will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to any principles of conflict of laws. Any action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of, this Agreement may be brought against either of the parties in the courts of Broward County, Florida and each of the parties consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein. 

  

  5. _Counterparts_. This Amendment may be executed in counterparts, including a facsimile, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement. 

  

  6. _Effect of Amendment_. The Employment Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, after the effective time of this Amendment, sets forth the entire understanding with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Employment Agreement, after the effective time of this Amendment, as amended hereby, shall continue in full force and effect.
