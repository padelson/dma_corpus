"<U>Consent Condition</U>"), (ii) the execution and delivery of the supplemental
indentures referred to in Section 9.06 of each of the Indentures by the
applicable trustee, (iii) the consummation of the Merger and (iv) the

Documents. The Company (i) shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offers
(other than that the Merger shall have been consummated) and make any change to
the terms and conditions of the Debt Offers as may be reasonably requested by
Parent so long as the Parent agrees to hold the Company harmless from any cost
or expense relating to or arising from such waiver or changes and (ii) shall
not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt
Offers or make any changes to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offers.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, and subject to the terms and

required to amend the terms and conditions of the Debt Offers pursuant to
instructions from Parent if such amendment would decrease the price per
applicable Note payable in the Debt Offers, increase the Consent Condition or
impose conditions to the Debt Offers in addition to those set forth in the Debt
Offer Documents that are materially adverse to the tendering holders of the
Notes. Parent has provided draft Debt Offer Documents to the Company prior to

the 2005 Indenture, the "<U>Indentures</U>"), among the Company, as issuer, the
guarantors named therein and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee, relating to
the Senior Secured Notes and (iii) appropriate amendments, as applicable, to the

indentures and amendments to the security documents shall implement the proposed
amendments set forth in the Debt Offer Documents and shall become operative
substantially concurrently with, but prior to, the Effective Time, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt
Offers). Subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Debt Offers
set forth in the Debt Offer Documents (including, without limitation, the
Consent Condition), substantially concurrently with, but not until after, the

Following the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective
officers, directors, agents and affiliates shall be entitled to indemnification
(from the Escrow Amount only and only to the extent of the Escrow Amount)
against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, claims, Taxes,
costs and expenses suffered, sustained, or incurred (collectively,
"<U>Losses</U>") that they may suffer, sustain, incur or become subject to
arising out of, in connection with or due to (i) any inaccuracy of any
representation or breach of any warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the representations and warranties
made in the officers' certificate delivered pursuant to <U>Section 6.2(f)</U>,
without giving effect, except in respect of <U>Section 3.6</U> hereof, to any
"materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," or similar qualifier or qualifiers
contained therein; provided, however that the representation and warranty of the
Company contained in <U>Section 3.10</U> shall not survive the Closing, (ii)
Environmental Costs, (iii) any claims made by Stockholders not executing
Stockholders' Letter Agreements in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (iv) the Severance Payments, if any, paid by the Surviving
Corporation or any affiliate thereof under Section 10(f) of the employment
agreements between the Company and each of the officers of the Company listed on
Exhibit E hereto (such Section 10(f) to be added to such employment agreements
pursuant to the SVP Amendments after the date of this Agreement) (it being
understood that, for purposes of this clause (iv) only, the term "Losses" shall
mean solely an amount or amounts equal to one-half of the Severance Payments
paid under such Section 10(f), based on the Base Salaries of such officers as in
effect on the date of this Agreement). The term "Losses" shall include interest,
penalties, fees and reasonable professional fees and expenses incurred in
connection with any of the foregoing, including without limitation the costs of
defending any claim or other proceeding covered by this indemnity, and in
investigating (in response to a claim) and seeking indemnification pursuant to
this <U>Article </U>VIII, net of any insurance proceeds (net of the present
value of any increase in premiums paid over the next five years attributable to
such insurance recovery) or other recoveries (net of all collection and other
costs incurred or attributable to such other recoveries) actually received by
the Indemnified Party or its affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise
to the right to indemnification; provided, however, that the term "Losses" shall
not include any amounts recovered, or recoverable, by Parent pursuant to
<U>Section 9.6</U> hereof.</FONT></P>

Losses arising above such Deductible Amount; provided that no indemnification
shall be available under <U>Sections 8.1(a)(i)</U> and <U>8.1(a)(ii)</U> for
Losses arising from any individual item or circumstance which does not exceed
$25,000, but once such $25,000 threshold is exceeded for such individual item or
circumstance, indemnification shall be available for all Losses so arising from
such individual item or circumstance; provided, further, that in respect of
Losses which constitute Environmental Costs, the $25,000 threshold set forth
above in this <U>Section 8.1(b)</U> shall apply on a property by property
(rather than an individual item or circumstance) basis (such $25,000 thresholds
being "<I><U>de minimus </U></I><U>Thresholds</U>"); provided,
however, that such limitations shall not apply to any fraudulent breach of any
representation or warranty. If the Losses on an individual item or circumstance
or, in the case of an Environmental Cost, on a property by property basis, do
not exceed the <I>de minimus</I> Threshold, then Losses attributable to such
individual item or circumstance or, in the case of an Environmental Cost, on a
property by property basis, shall not be counted towards the Deductible Amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the aggregate of indemnification
obligations pursuant to (i) this <U>Section 8.1</U> shall not exceed the Escrow
Amount and any claims for indemnification may be made only against the Escrow
Amount and (ii) <U>Section 8.1(a)(ii)</U> shall not exceed $10,000,000 of the
Escrow Amount and any claims for indemnification may be made only against such
portion of the Escrow Amount, subject in each case to the provisions of

conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Effective Time, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy

that if, at any time prior to expiration of the applicable representation and

<U>Section 8.3(a)</U> alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of
such representation and warranty and asserting a claim for recovery under
<U>Section 8.1(a)(i)</U> based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the
representation or warranty underlying the claim asserted in such notice shall
survive with respect to such claim only until such time as such claim is fully

Intermediate Parent and Merger Sub shall terminate and expire at the Effective
Time. Subject to the second proviso of the first sentence of this <U>Section
8.1(d)</U>, upon the expiration of a representation or warranty, any Losses that
would have been attributable to a breach of such representation or warranty
shall no longer be recoverable under a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement, it being understood that the non-survivability of the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in <U>Section 3.10</U> shall not effect
the right to indemnification under <U>Section 8.1(a)(ii)</U>.</FONT></P>

By virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the

decisions required or permitted to be taken by it under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and <U>Schedule 1.1(a)</U> hereto, and to exercising such rights, power and
authority as are incidental hereto (including the right, power and authority to retain
attorneys, accountants and other advisors to assist it in the performance of its duties
hereunder). The Stockholders' Representative shall have the ability and power to
execute and deliver all instruments, certificates and other documents of every kind
incident to the foregoing and with all right, power and authority to act on behalf of the
Stockholders in connection herewith. Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the

Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and <U>Schedule 1.1(a)</U> hereto. If the then-current
Stockholders' Representative shall resign its position or be unable to fulfill its
responsibilities as agent of the Stockholders, then the then-current Stockholders'
Representative shall as soon as practicable appoint a successor representative reasonably
satisfactory to Parent. Any such successor shall become the "Stockholders'
Representative" for purposes of <U>Article VIII</U> of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and <U>Schedule 1.1(a)</U> hereto; and no such resignation of the then-current
Stockholders' Representative shall be effective as to the then-current

Representative for, and agree that the Stockholders' Representative shall have
no liability for, any action or inaction taken or not taken by the Stockholders'
Representative in connection with its capacity as the Stockholders'
Representative, except to the extent that such action or inaction shall have
been held by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Stockholders' Representative may consult with legal
counsel and may rely on, and shall be fully protected in reliance on, any such
advice of counsel. </FONT></P>

in good faith to be genuine and signed by any party or parties hereto or an
authorized officer or agent thereof, and shall not be required to investigate

Stockholders), jointly and severally, shall be liable for and shall reimburse
and indemnify Escrow Agent and hold Escrow Agent (and its officers, directors,
employees and agents) harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, costs and
disbursements) that the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur in connection with this
Agreement and its performance hereunder or in connection herewith, except to the
extent such loss, liability, damage or expense arises from its willful
misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence as adjudicated by<B> </B>a court of
competent<B> </B>jurisdiction; provided, however, in seeking reimbursement or
indemnification from the Stockholders&#146; Representative hereunder, the Escrow

against, and shall only be reimbursed from, the Escrow Fund, and, in no event

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to give the property held in escrow by

property. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp; The
fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent are set forth on <U>Schedule B</U>
attached hereto. The Escrow Agent&#146;s annual fee shall be payable upon the

one-half by Parent and one-half by the Stockholders (payable solely from the
Escrow Fund). The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the
Escrow Agent in connection with this Agreement. All such expenses, disbursements
and advances, and any fees in addition to the annual fee, payable to the Escrow
Agent hereunder shall be paid to the Escrow Agent one-half by Parent and
one-half by the Stockholders (payable solely from the Escrow Fund). The Escrow
Agent shall give the Stockholders&#146; Representative and Parent prompt written

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed upon request for all reasonable

The Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, resign and terminate its position
hereunder at any time following thirty (30) Business Days&#146; written notice
to the parties to this Agreement. Any such resignation shall terminate all
obligations and duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder. The Stockholders&#146;
Representative and Parent may at any time jointly remove the Escrow Agent by

hundred million dollars ($500,000,000), and which shall be mutually agreeable to
Parent and the Stockholders&#146; Representative and appointed by written
instrument executed by the Stockholders&#146; Representative and Parent and
delivered to the Escrow Agent and to such successor Escrow Agent and, thereupon,
the resignation or removal of the predecessor Escrow Agent shall become
effective and such successor Escrow Agent, without any further act, deed or
conveyance, shall become vested with all right, title and interest to all cash
and property held hereunder of such predecessor Escrow Agent, and such
predecessor Escrow Agent shall, on the written request of an authorized
signatory of both the Stockholders&#146; Representative and Parent, execute and
deliver to such successor Escrow Agent all the right, title and interest
hereunder in and to the Escrow Fund of such predecessor Escrow Agent and all
other rights hereunder of such predecessor Escrow Agent. If no successor Escrow
Agent shall have been appointed within twenty (20) Business Days of a notice of
resignation by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent&#146;s sole responsibility
shall thereafter be to hold the Escrow Fund until the earlier of (i) its receipt
of designation of a successor Escrow Agent in a joint written instruction by the
Stockholders&#146; Representative and Parent and (ii) termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms. If no successor Escrow Agent shall have
been appointed within twenty (20) Business Days of the Escrow Agent&#146;s
delivery of a notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for such appointment, or other appropriate relief. Any
such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the parties to this
Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;
Within five (5) Business Days following the end of each calendar month prior to
termination of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent will supply an official account
statement to the Parent and the Stockholders&#146; Representative setting forth
(a) the then current balance of the Escrow Fund, (b) the details of each
transaction in the account during such month, and (c) a description of the
amount and type of the individual investment positions in the Escrow Fund as of
such time. </FONT></P>

The Escrow Agent does not have any interest in the Escrow Account but is serving
as escrow holder only and having only possession thereof. Upon request, the
Escrow Agent shall be paid or reimbursed for any transfer taxes related to the
Escrow Fund incurred in connection herewith, and Parent and the
Stockholders&#146; Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders), jointly and
severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from any amounts
that the Escrow Agent is obligated to pay in the way of such taxes, with
responsibility for such payment, reimbursement, indemnity or holding the Escrow
Agent harmless to be borne by Parent and by the Stockholders&#146;
Representative; provided, however, in seeking reimbursement or indemnification
from the Stockholders&#146; Representative hereunder, the Escrow Agent may make
a claim against, and shall only be reimbursed from, the Escrow Fund, and, in no
event shall the Stockholders&#146; Representative be liable for any claims in
its individual capacity. If necessary under applicable law, any payments of
income from the Escrow Fund shall be subject to withholding regulations then in
force with respect to U.S. taxes. This <U>Section 5.1(j)</U> and <U>Section

the resignation of the Escrow Agent. </FONT></P>

In the event of any disagreement between the other parties hereto resulting in
adverse claims or demands being made in connection with the Escrow Fund, or in
the event that the Escrow Agent in good faith is in doubt as to what action it
should take hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to retain such portion
of the Escrow Fund that is subject to such adverse claims or demands until the
Escrow Agent shall have received (i) a final nonappealable order of a court
having jurisdiction directing delivery of the Escrow Fund presented to the
Escrow Agent by the prevailing party, or (ii) a written agreement executed by
the parties hereto (other than the Escrow Agent) directing delivery of the
Escrow Fund, in which event the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Fund in
accordance with such order, judgment or agreement. Any court order shall be
accompanied by a legal opinion of counsel for the presenting party reasonably
satisfactory to the Escrow Agent to the effect that said order or judgment is
final and nonappealable. The Escrow Agent shall act on such court order or
judgment and legal opinion without further question.</FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n)&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Escrow Agent shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted
to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with any direction of Parent and

None of the provisions of this Agreement shall require the Escrow Agent to
expend or risk its own funds or otherwise to incur any liability, financial or
otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise
of any of its rights or powers if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing
that repayment of such funds, or indemnity satisfactory to it against such risk
or liability, is not assured to it. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(p)&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Agreement the Escrow
Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be provided or
established prior to taking or suffering any action to be taken hereunder, such
matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically
prescribed) may, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent, be deemed to be conclusively proved
and established by a certificate signed by an authorized signatory of both
Parent and the Stockholders&#146; Representative and delivered to the Escrow
Agent, and such certificate, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent, shall be full warrant to the
Escrow Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the
provisions of this Agreement upon the faith thereof as adjudicated by a court of
competent jurisdiction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

of the Escrow Fund as provided in <U>Article IV</U> or for investment losses

adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, and (ii) covenants not to sue

consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including lost profits),
even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or
damage and regardless of the form of action. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(u)&nbsp;&nbsp;

time of execution of this Agreement), whether in writing, by telecopier or

satisfied with the verification it receives, it will not execute the instruction
until all issues are resolved. The persons and telephone numbers for callbacks
may be changed only in writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow
Agent. The parties agree to notify the Escrow Agent of any errors, delays or
other problems within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving notification

Stockholder shall be liable to the Company Releasees for their reasonable

Delaware corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Parent

execution and delivery of this letter agreement by such Stockholder, entering

merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;),
in which (i) all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the &#147;<U>Company Common Stock</U>&#148;)
(including all outstanding restricted shares of Company Common Stock, which
shall become vested in connection with the Merger, and other than shares issued
and held in the Company&#146;s treasury) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Common Stock Cash Consideration, the Escrow Fund, if any, as may be
distributed in accordance with the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
the Common Stock Deferred Payment and the amount remaining, if any, in the
Stockholders&#146; Representative Expense Account, as it may be distributed in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, in each case, as determined
in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and, additionally, in the
case of the Escrow Fund, with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and (ii) all of
the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (the &#147;<U>Company Preferred Stock</U>&#148;)

accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Concurrently with the
execution of this letter agreement, the Stockholders, collectively being the
holders of approximately 61.5% of the outstanding Company Common Stock and 68.3%
of the outstanding Company Preferred Stock, are executing a written consent (the
<U>&#147;Written Consent</U>&#148;) approving the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including without limitation, the Merger.
Capitalized terms used without definition in this letter agreement shall have
the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. </FONT></P>

of Written Consent; Bond Tenders</U>. (a) During the term of this letter
agreement, each Stockholder hereby agrees to vote all the Shares (as defined in
paragraph 6(a)) owned by such Stockholder and any other capital stock of the
Company that such Stockholder becomes entitled to vote, whether through
contract, purchase, exercise of an option or otherwise (&#147;<U>Additional
Shares</U>&#148;) to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement (and any subsequent
amendments thereto that do not effect the consideration payable to such
Stockholder or adversely effect such Stockholder in any other manner), the
Merger and all other agreements and actions to be undertaken in connection
therewith, at every meeting of stockholders, if any, of the Company, and at
every adjournment thereof (or by written consent in lieu of a meeting), at which
such matters are submitted for the consideration and vote of stockholders of the
Company. Each Stockholder hereby further agrees that it will not vote (or give a
written consent with respect to) any Shares or Additional Shares in favor of the
approval of (i) any proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, business
combination, tender offer, sale of substantially all of the Company&#146;s
assets, sale of shares of capital stock or similar transactions involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, (ii) any reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
winding up of the Company or any other similar extraordinary transaction
involving the Company, or (iii) any corporate action the consummation of which
would frustrate the purposes, or prevent or delay the consummation, of the
Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Each
Stockholder expressly agrees that it shall not revoke its consent approving the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including without
limitation, the Merger, such consent evidenced by such Stockholder&#146;s
execution of the Written Consent. Except as set forth in the previous three
sentences of this paragraph 1(a), no Stockholder shall be restricted from voting
in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any matter presented to the
stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this letter agreement shall require any
Stockholder to acquire Additional Shares. Nothing in this letter agreement shall
be construed as creating any obligations of, or restrictions on, any officers,
directors, employees or other representatives of such Stockholder in their

This Amendment to Employment Agreement (&#147;Amendment&#148;) is hereby entered
into as of July __, 2006 by and among NationsRent Companies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and [William Stewart] [Francis X. Hassis]

Agreement dated as of ____________, 200_, as presently in effect (the
&#147;Employment Agreement&#148;); and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
WHEREAS, the Company (as authorized by its Board of Directors) and the Executive
desire to amend certain provisions of the Employment Agreement; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual
covenants and undertakings contained herein, and for such other good and
valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties to this Amendment hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Amendment to Section 10 of the
Employment Agreement</U>. Section 10 of the Employment Agreement is hereby
amended by adding the following new Section 10(f) thereto and relettering the
current Section 10(f) to Section 10(g): </FONT></P>

<TD WIDTH=95%>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#147;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Additional Employee
Termination Right</I>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, following a Change of Control, for a period commencing on the
six-calendar month anniversary of such Change of Control and ending on the
thirty-first day prior to the one-year anniversary of such Change of Control
(e.g., if the Change of Control occurs on August 24, 2006, such period shall run
from February 24, 2007 through July 25, 2007, inclusive), the Executive shall
have the right, upon not less than 30-days prior written notice, to terminate
his employment hereunder for any reason whatsoever (or for no reason) by
delivering to the Company written notice of such election to terminate his
employment hereunder, such termination to be effective on the date thirty days
after the date of such written notice (or, if not a business day, the first
business day thereafter). Upon the Executive exercising such right, then,
neither the Executive nor his beneficiary or estate shall have any further
rights or claims against the Company under this Agreement or otherwise, except
the Accrued Rights, which shall be paid to the Executive immediately upon the
effectiveness of such termination, and the Severance Payments, which shall be
paid to the Executive immediately upon the effectiveness of such termination;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that for purposes of this Section 10(f) only,
Severance Payments will equal 200% of the Executive&#146;s Base Salary as in
effect on July __, 2006, the date of this Amendment. In consideration for the
Severance Payments, the Executive agrees to execute a release releasing the
Company and its Affiliates (as defined in Section 10(c) above) from all actions,
claims, demands, causes of action, obligations, damages, liabilities, expenses
and controversies of any nature, excluding those arising in connection with the
enforcement of Executive&#146;s indemnification rights. In addition, the
Executive&#146;s right to receive any Severance Payments shall be subject to the
prior receipt by the Company of an executed acknowledgment by the Executive, in
a form satisfactory to the Company, of his continuing obligations to the Company
under Sections 11 and 12 of this Agreement, which obligations under Sections
12(a), (b) and (c) shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, survive for a period equal to the Non-Competition Period (as defined
in Section 12(b) below). For purposes of this Section 10(f), the first day of
the Executive&#146;s right to terminate his employment under this Section 10(f)
shall commence at 9:00 a.m. New York local time on such day and the last day of
the Executive&#146;s right to terminate his employment under this Section 10(f)
shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. New York local time on such day (or, if such day is
not a business day, the first business day thereafter). Additionally, if a
Change of Control shall have no corresponding six-calendar month anniversary,
the calculation of the period of Executive&#146;s right to terminate his
