respect to the cash amounts payable upon surrender of their Certificates.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any

remaining unclaimed by holders of the Certificates, book-entry shares or book-
entry units immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity

Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders
or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto.

 



 

(d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent and the Exchange Agent and the taking of such other actions as may be
reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent shall pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash amount
payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares or
Partnership Common Units that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or the Operating Partnership, as applicable, payment may be made with

to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes relating to such transfer have been paid.

 



 

(f) As of the Company Merger Effective Time, the share transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration

Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article 2_ upon
surrender of any Certificates (or automatically in the case of book-entry
shares of Company Common Shares) shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificates. From and after the
Company Merger Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Shares except
as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates representing such Company Common Shares are presented to
the Surviving Entity for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(g) As of the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the unit transfer books of

deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Certificates. From and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the
holders of Partnership Units outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Partnership Units except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable

representing such Partnership Units are presented to the Surviving Partnership
for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 



 

(h) After the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included
in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Surviving Entity. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving
Entity. Until the termination of the Exchange Fund, to the extent that there
are losses with respect to such investments, or the cash portion of the
Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make
prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the
Surviving Entity shall promptly replace or restore the cash portion of the
Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that
the cash portion of the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level
sufficient to make all such payments.

Performance Award, without interest (such amounts, the " **Performance Award
Payments** ") (less required withholdings as provided in _Section 2.11_). In
addition, on the Closing Date, the Company shall pay each holder of a
Performance Award an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid cash dividends
that would have been paid on such earned and vested Performance Awards as if

Effective Time, each Company Equity Incentive Plan shall terminate, and the
Company shall ensure that following the Company Merger Effective Time, no

arrangements shall have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities
of the Company, the Surviving Entity or any subsidiary thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Parent Funding_. At the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Surviving Entity cash in the amount necessary, together with
the other funds of the Surviving Entity, to make the payments required under
this _Section 2.8_, other than the Performance Award Dividends, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Entity to make the payments required under this
_Section 2.8_ through the Surviving Entitys payroll within five (5) Business
Days after the Company Merger Effective Time, or at such later time as
necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse Tax consequences under Section
409A of the Code.

in the name of the Company or otherwise) take such action.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Withholding of Tax_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Entity, any
Affiliate thereof or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and

Surviving Entity, any Affiliate thereof or the Exchange Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Entity, any Affiliate thereof or the Exchange Agent and
withheld amounts are paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity in
accordance with Laws or Order, then for all purposes of this Agreement such
amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Tax Consequences_. The parties intend that for U.S. federal,
and applicable state, income tax purposes (a) the Company Merger shall be
treated as a taxable sale by the Company of all of the Companys assets to
Merger Sub in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration to be provided
to the stockholders of the Company and the assumption of all of the Companys
liabilities, followed by a distribution of such Merger Consideration to the
stockholders of the Company in liquidation pursuant to Section 331 and Section
562 of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan
of liquidation" of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (b)
the Partnership Merger shall be treated as a taxable sale of the Partnership
Common Units by holders other than the Acquired Companies in exchange for the
applicable Merger Consideration. The parties hereto agree not to take any
position on any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the foregoing for all
U.S. federal, and, if applicable, state and local tax purposes.

behalf) all income and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed by
any of them (after giving effect to any filing extension granted by a
Governmental Entity), and all such filed Tax Returns are correct, complete and
accurate in all material respects. All material Taxes payable by or on behalf
of each of the Acquired Companies (whether or not shown on a Tax Return) have
been fully and timely paid or adequately provided for in accordance with GAAP,
and adequate reserves or accruals for Taxes have been provided in accordance
with GAAP with respect to any period for which Tax Returns have not yet been
filed or for which Taxes are not yet due and owing or for which Taxes are
being contested in good faith. No power of attorney with respect to any Tax

(b) The Company (i) for all taxable years commencing with its taxable year
ended December 31, 1998 through December 31, 2017 has been subject to taxation
as a real estate investment trust (a " **REIT** ") within the meaning of
Section 856 of the Code and has been organized and operated in conformity with
all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated since
December 31, 2017 to the date hereof, and intends to continue to operate until
the Closing, in such a manner as to permit it to continue to qualify as a
REIT, and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action which would
reasonably be expected to result in the Companys failure to qualify as a
REIT, and no challenge to the Companys status or qualification as a REIT is
pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened in writing. _Part 3.11(b)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each Subsidiary of the Company
and its classification for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of the date
hereof. Each entity that is listed in _Part 3.11(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as a partnership, joint venture, or limited liability
company has, since the later of the date of its formation and the date on
which the Company acquired an interest in such entity, been treated for U.S.

corporation. Each entity that is listed in _Part 3.11(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as a corporation has, since the later of the date of its
formation

 



       
 

 



 

or the date on which the Company acquired an interest in such entity, been
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a REIT, a "qualified REIT
subsidiary" pursuant to Section 856(i) of the Code (a " **QRS** ") or a
"taxable REIT subsidiary" pursuant to Section 856(l) of the Code (a " **TRS**
") as set forth on such schedule. Each entity that is listed in _Part

which would subject it to Tax on built-in gain pursuant to IRS Notice 88-19,

Treasury Regulations thereunder) or (ii) any other material liability for
Taxes that have become due and that have not been previously paid other than
in the ordinary course of business. Since its formation, none of the Acquired
Companies (other than a TRS or any subsidiary of a TRS) has engaged at any
time in any "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6)
of the Code. Since its formation, none of the Acquired Companies has engaged
in any transaction that would give rise to "redetermined rents, redetermined
deductions and excess interest" described in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code. To

Material Adverse Effect. No vote of Parents equity holders is necessary to
adopt this Agreement or to approve any of the Transactions.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Not an Interested Stockholder_. None of the Parent Parties or
any of their respective Affiliates, within the past five years, has
beneficially owned (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) any
Company Capital Shares or Partnership Units or any securities that are
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Company Capital Shares or
Partnership Units, or holds any rights to acquire or vote any Company Capital
Shares or Partnership Units, other than pursuant to this Agreement. None of
the Parent Parties or any of their Subsidiaries, or the "Affiliates" or, to
the knowledge of the Parent Parties, the "associates" of any such person,
within the past five years, has been an "interested stockholder" of the
Company, in each case as defined in Section 3-601 of the MGCL.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Available Funds_. Parent has received and accepted, and has
delivered to the Company, a true, correct and complete fully executed copy of
the Equity Commitment Letter from the Sponsor to invest, subject to the terms
and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein (being
referred to as the " **Equity Financing** "). The Equity Commitment Letter has
not been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded, supplemented, amended
or modified, no terms thereunder have been waived, and no such withdrawal,
termination, repudiation, rescission, supplement, amendment, modification or
waiver is contemplated. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the
Equity Commitment Letter on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the
Equity Financing is funded in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter,
the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in this

 



       
 

 



 

Agreement and the performance in all material respects by the Company Parties
of their obligations under this Agreement, at the Closing, Parent will have
sufficient cash on hand to consummate the Transactions and satisfy all of its
obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger
Consideration, any fees and expenses of or payable by the Parent Parties or
the Surviving Entity, any payments in respect of equity compensation
obligations required to be made in connection with the Mergers, and any
repayment or refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness of Parent, the
Company, and their respective Subsidiaries required in connection therewith.
The Equity Commitment Letter is, as to Parent and the other parties thereto,
enforceable against such Persons in accordance with its terms, in each case,
as enforcement may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. The
Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto; and no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach under the Equity
Commitment Letter. Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Equity Financing will not
be satisfied on a timely basis or that the full amount of the Equity Financing
will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date of the Closing
should it occur pursuant to Section 2.3. The Equity Commitment Letter contains
all of the conditions precedent and other conditions and contingencies to the
obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the Equity
Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. There are no side letters
or other agreements, arrangements or understandings (written or oral) to which
Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related (directly or indirectly) to
the Equity Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter. The obligations of the Parent Parties under this Agreement
are not subject to any conditions regarding Parents, Merger Subs, their
respective Affiliates or any other Persons (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any of the Acquired Companies) ability to obtain the Equity Financing.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
to Parents, Merger Subs and Merger OPs obligation to consummate the
Mergers, (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
Parties set forth in Article 3 hereof, and (c) the financial projections or
forecasts provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof have been
prepared in good faith on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable,
then after giving effect to all of the Transactions, including the Equity
Financing, each of Parent and the Surviving Entity will be Solvent as of the
Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the Transactions. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Solvent** " when used with respect to
any Person, means that, as of any date of determination (i) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (A) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including an estimate
of contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms
are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable Liabilities of such Person on its existing debts
(including contingent and other Liabilities) as such debts become absolute and
mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (iii) such Person will be
able to pay its Liabilities, including contingent and other Liabilities, as
they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to

 



      
 

 



 

generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Guarantee_. Parent has furnished the Company with a duly
executed, accurate and complete copy of the Guarantee. The Guarantee is in
full force and effect. The Guarantee is (i) a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Sponsor and (ii) enforceable in accordance with its
respective terms against the Sponsor, except as enforceability may be limited
by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There is no breach or default under
the Guarantee by the Sponsor, and no event has occurred that would constitute
a breach or default (or with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute
a breach or default) thereunder by the Sponsor.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Brokers_. There are no investment bankers, brokers or finders
that have been retained by or are authorized to act on behalf of the Parent
Parties who are entitled to any banking, brokers, finders or similar fee or
commission payable by the Company or any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective shareholders in connection with the Mergers and the other
Transactions based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of the Parent
Parties.

 



 

Section 4.10 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. As of the date hereof, none of
the Parent Parties nor any of their respective controlled Affiliates has
entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case,
whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), (i) pursuant to which any shareholder of the Company or limited
partner of the Operating Partnership would be entitled to receive, in respect
of any Company Common Share or Partnership Unit, consideration of a different
amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any
shareholder of the Company or limited partner of the Operating Partnership has
agreed to vote to adopt this Agreement or has agreed to vote against any
Superior Proposal or (ii) pursuant to which any shareholder of the Acquired
Companies has agreed to make an investment in, or contribution to, any of the
Parent Parties in connection with the Transactions, in each case that would
not terminate and be void concurrently with any termination of this Agreement.
Other than this Agreement, the Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement, as
of the date hereof, there are no Contracts or any commitments to enter into
any Contract between Parent, Merger Sub or Merger OP or any of their
respective controlled Affiliates, on the one hand, and any trustee, officer,
employee or shareholder of the Company or the Operating Partnership, on the
other hand, relating to the Transactions or the operations of the Surviving
Entity after the Company Merger Effective Time or the Surviving Partnership
after the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Compliance_. Each of the Parent Parties is in, and since January
1, 2016 has been in, compliance with all Laws applicable to its businesses,
except where the failure to comply with such Laws has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of the
Parent Parties has, during the past five years: (i) received any written
notice from any Governmental Entity regarding any material violation by the
Parent Parties of any Law; or (ii) provided any written notice to any
Governmental Entity regarding any material violation by any of the Parent
Parties of any Law, which notice in either case remains outstanding or
unresolved as of the date hereof, except for such notices that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

be held); provided that Parent may make any such request only once with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is
subsequently materially modified in which case Parent may make such request
once each time such material modification is made is; (v) fail to publicly
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange
offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act (including, for these
purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the Companys shareholders) within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer; (vi)
publicly propose or publicly announce an intention to take any of the
foregoing actions (any action described in clause "(i)" through clause "(vi)"
being referred to as a " **Change in Recommendation** "); or (vii) approve,
adopt, declare advisable or recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to
approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or cause or permit any
Acquired Company to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other Contract (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in compliance with _Section 5.2(a)_)
contemplating an Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company or the
Operating Partnership to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Transactions (any such agreement, an " **Alternative Acquisition Agreement**
") or otherwise resolve or agree to do so.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company
Board may:

 



 

(i) make a Change in Recommendation in response to an unsolicited written
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(h)_ if and only if: (A) such Acquisition Proposal is not
withdrawn and the Company is not in breach of this _Section 5.2_; (B) the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
(1) that such Acquisition Proposal would, if this Agreement was not amended or
an alternative transaction with Parent were not entered into, constitute a
Superior Proposal and (2) that in light of such Acquisition Proposal, a
failure to make a Change in Recommendation and/or to cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_, absent revision to the
terms of this Agreement as contemplated in clause "(D)" below, would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law; (C) the Company delivers to Parent a
written notice (a " **Superior Proposal Notice** ") that includes (1) a
statement that the Company Board intends to make a Change in Recommendation
and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ as described
above, (2) the identity of the Third Party or group making the Acquisition
Proposal and (3) all material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal
(including copies of all material documents, relevant proposed agreements,
amendments and financing commitments, relating to the proposed Alternative
Acquisition Agreement); (D) during the four (4) Business Day period commencing
on the date of Parents receipt

 



      
 

 



 

of such Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall have made its
Representatives reasonably available for the purpose of engaging in
negotiations and shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement or a
possible alternative transaction so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the
subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal; (E) after the expiration of the negotiation period described in
clause "(D)" above, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, and after taking into account any amendments to this
Agreement proposed in writing by the Parent Parties as a result of the
negotiations contemplated by clause "(D)" above, that (1) such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (2) the failure to
make a Change in Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(h)_ would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
obligations to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law; and (F) in the
event of any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount
and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to
Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause "(C)"
above and a new notice period shall commence (except that the four (4)
Business Day notice period referred to in clause "(D)" above shall instead be
equal to the longer of (1) two (2) Business Days and (2) the period remaining
under the notice period under clause "(D)" immediately prior to the delivery
of such additional notice under this clause "(F)" during which time the
Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section
5.2_ anew with respect to such additional notice); or

 



 

(ii) make a Change in Recommendation not related to an Acquisition Proposal
if: (A) any material change in circumstances with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole that, in each case, occurred or arose after
the date hereof, which (x) was not known by, nor reasonably foreseeable to,
the Company Board as of, or prior to, the date hereof and (y) becomes known to
the Company Board prior to the Company Shareholder Approval (any such material
change in circumstances described in this clause (A) referred to as a "
**Change in Circumstances** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
following will constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has
been, a Change in Circumstances: (1) the receipt by the Company of, existence
of or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or any matter
relating thereto or consequence thereof, (2) any change in Law or GAAP, (3)
changes, in and of itself, in the market price or trading volume of the
Company Common Shares or the credit rating of the Company or (4) the fact
that, in and of itself, the Company meets or exceeds internal or public
projections or forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other financial
results for any period; (B) the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change
in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
obligations to the Companys shareholders under applicable Laws; (C) such
Change in Recommendation is not effected prior to the fourth (4th) Business
Day after Parent receives written notice from the Company that includes (1) a
statement confirming that the Company Board intends to effect such Change in
Recommendation and (2) a reasonably detailed description of the

 



       
 

 



 

Change in Circumstances; (D) during such four (4) Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations, and shall
have caused its Representatives to engage in good faith negotiations, with
Parent to amend this Agreement, or to enter into an alternative transaction in
order to obviate the need to make such Change in Recommendation; and (E) at
the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and after taking into account any amendments to this
Agreement proposed in writing by the Parent Parties as a result of the
negotiations contemplated by clause "(D)" above, that, in light of such Change
in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would
continue to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to
the Companys shareholders under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) The Company agrees that all references to the Company or the Company Board
in this _Section 5.2_ shall include its Representatives, all references to
the Company in this _Section 5.2_, shall include the Company Board and any
breach of this _Section 5.2_ by the Company Board or any Representatives of
the Company or the Company Board will be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by the Company.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company, the Company Board or its Representatives from: (i)
taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, _provided_ that any
such disclosure does not contain an express Change in Recommendation; (ii)
disclosing to the Companys shareholders any factual information regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the
fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal, in each case, that the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
is required under applicable Law (it being understood that disclosure under
this clause (ii) shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the
Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) under this Agreement
and no such disclosure shall, taken by itself, be deemed to be a Change in
Recommendation); or (iii) communicating in writing with any Third Party (or
the Representatives of such Person) that makes any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry to the extent necessary to direct such Third Party to the
provisions of this _Section 5.2_; _provided, however_ , that (A) the Company
Board shall not make any Change in Recommendation except in accordance with
_Section 5.2(d)_ and (B) any such statement or disclosure made by the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) pursuant to this sentence must be subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that nothing in the foregoing
will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) to effect a Change in Recommendation.

 



 

(g) The Company will, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and
their officers, trustees and directors to, and shall direct its and their
other Representatives to,

 



      
 

 



 

immediately cease any solicitations, discussions, negotiations or
communications with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting; Vote of
Parent_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (but no later than thirty (30) days)
after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare a proxy
statement in preliminary form for the Shareholders Meeting (together with any
amendments thereof or supplements thereto and any other required proxy
materials, the " **Proxy Statement** ") and, after consultation with, and
approval by, Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
file the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain and furnish the information
required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement, and respond
promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement,
and (ii) promptly upon the earlier of (A) receiving notification that the SEC
is not reviewing the preliminary Proxy Statement and (B) the conclusion of any
SEC review of the preliminary Proxy Statement, cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders and, if necessary, after
the definitive Proxy Statement shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate
amended or supplemental proxy materials and, if required in connection
therewith, resolicit proxies. The Company shall notify Parent and Merger Sub
promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
other Government Officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any
other Government Officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement and shall supply the others with copies of all correspondence
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its
staff or any other Government Officials, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing
to the Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be required to be
set forth in the Proxy Statement under applicable Law. The Proxy Statement
shall contain the Company Board Recommendation, except to the extent that the
Company Board shall have effected a Change in Recommendation, as permitted by
and determined in accordance with _Section 5.2_. Parent shall ensure that
such information supplied by it in writing for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to shareholders of the
Company and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting or filed with the SEC (as
applicable), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above,
prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto), or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and shall consider Parents comments in
good faith. The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not on
the date it is first mailed to shareholders of the Company and at the time of
the Shareholders Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information
supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(b) If at any time prior to the Shareholders Meeting any event or circumstance
relating to the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or
their respective officers, trustees or directors, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, which, pursuant to the Exchange Act,
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other party
hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the Companys shareholders. All documents that the Company is
responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Mergers will comply
as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 



 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy
Statement by the SEC, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and
the Companys Organizational Documents, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a special meeting of the Companys shareholders (including any
adjournments and postponements thereof, the " **Shareholders Meeting** ") for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ that
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, that the Company may
postpone or adjourn the Shareholders Meeting after consultation with Parent
(A) with the consent of Parent, (B) for the absence of a quorum, (C) to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided
to the holders of Company Common Shares within a reasonable amount of time in
advance of the Shareholders Meeting, or (D) to allow additional solicitation
of votes in order to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ that,
in the case of clause (B) and this clause (D), without the written consent of
Parent, in no event shall the Shareholders Meeting (as so postponed or
adjourned) be held on a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date
for which the Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled. Unless the
Company Board or any committee thereof has withdrawn the Company Board
Recommendation in compliance with _Section 5.2_, the Company, through the
Company Board, shall recommend to holders of the Company Common Shares that
they vote in favor of the Company Merger so that the Company may obtain the
Company Shareholder Approval and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit the Company Shareholder Approval (including by
soliciting proxies from the Companys shareholders) and shall take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Shareholder Approval. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to proxy
solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent. Unless this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with Article 7, (x) the Company shall not submit
to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal and (y) the
obligation of the Company to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Shareholders Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement (and any amendment or
supplement thereto that may be required by Law) to the Companys shareholders
shall not be affected by an Change in Recommendation.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Action_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company Parties and the Parent Parties shall: (i) as promptly
as practicable make and effect all registrations, filings and submissions
required to be made or effected by it or otherwise advisable pursuant to the
Exchange Act and other applicable Law with respect to the Mergers; (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals required
from Third Parties in connection with the Transactions; and (iii) use
reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, on a timely basis, all other
actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose of consummating and
effectuating the Transactions, including if necessary the divestiture, hold
separate or other disposition of any asset or business of the Parent Parties
or the Acquired Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) without the prior
written consent of Parent, in no event shall any Company Party (x) take any
action referenced in clause (iii) above relating to the divestiture, holding
separate or other disposition of any asset or business of the Parent Parties
or the Acquired Companies, or (y) pay any fee, penalty or other consideration,
make any commitment or incur any Liability to any Person for any consent or
approval in connection with the Transactions and (B) in no event shall any of
the Parent Parties or any of their Affiliates be required to pay any fee,
penalty or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any Liability to
any Person for any consent or approval in connection with the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this
_Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall require the Parent Parties
to take or agree to take any action with respect to any of their Affiliates,
including selling, divesting, conveying, holding separate, or otherwise
limiting its freedom of action with respect to any assets, rights, products,
licenses, businesses, operations, or interest therein, of any such Affiliates
or any direct or indirect portfolio companies (as such term is understood in
the private equity industry) of investment funds advised or managed by one or
more Affiliates of the Parent Parties. In the event that any party fails to
obtain any such consent or approval, the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent
and their respective Affiliates and business resulting, or which would
reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, from the failure
to obtain such consent.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in _Section
5.4(a)_, subject to applicable Law, each party shall: (i) give the other
parties prompt written notice of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the other
Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; and (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of (and provide copies of) any communication
to or from any Governmental Entity and keep the other parties reasonably
informed regarding any substantive communications to or from a third party, in
each case regarding the Mergers or other Transactions. Each party hereto will
have the right to review in advance, and each party will consult and cooperate
with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other
parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. In addition, except
as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding,
each party will permit authorized Representatives of the other parties to be
present at each meeting or conference relating to such

 



      
 

 



 

request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted in writing to any Governmental Entity in connection with such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding.

 



 

(c) In the event that any Legal Proceeding is commenced challenging the
Mergers or any of the other Transactions and such Legal Proceeding seeks, or
would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent the consummation of the
Mergers or the other Transactions, the Parent Parties and the Company Parties
shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve any such Legal Proceeding and
each of the Parent Parties and the Company Parties shall cooperate with each
other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest any such
Legal Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction, or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Mergers or the other Transactions.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Access_. Upon reasonable advance notice, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (x) afford Parents Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the Effective Time, to all properties, facilities, officers, offices and other
facilities, and books and records of the Acquired Companies and, during such
period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent all readily available
information concerning its business, properties, Contracts, assets and
liabilities of the Acquired Companies as Parent may reasonably request and (y)
permit such inspections as Parent may reasonably require and promptly furnish
Parent with such financial and operating data and other information with
respect to the business, properties and personnel of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ _,_ _however_ ,
that the Acquired Companies shall not be required to permit any inspection or
other access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment
of the Company could: (a) violate any obligation of the Acquired Companies
with respect to confidentiality, non-disclosure or privacy to a Third Party;
(b) jeopardize protections afforded to any of the Acquired Companies under the
attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine, and in any
such event, the parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements; (c) violate any Law; or
(d) materially interfere with the conduct of the Acquired Companies business
(provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow
for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in the events
set out in clauses (a) through (d)). No investigation pursuant to this
_Section 5.5_ shall affect or be deemed to qualify, modify or limit any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party or any condition to
the obligations of the parties. All requests for access pursuant to this
_Section 5.5_ must be directed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
or another Person designated in writing by the Company. All information
obtained by Parent and its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.5_
shall be treated as " **Evaluation Material** " of the Acquired Companies for
purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Interim Operations of Merger Sub and Merger OP_. During the
period from the date hereof through the earlier of the Effective Time or the
date of termination of this Agreement, Merger Sub and Merger OP shall not
engage in any activities of any nature except as provided in or contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.7 _Publicity_. The initial press release relating to this Agreement
shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent, and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) a party may, without the prior
consent of the other parties hereto, issue such press release or make such
public statement as may be required by Law or Order or the applicable rules of
NYSE if it has provided the other party with an opportunity to review and
comment (and the parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any
such press release or public statement) upon any such press release or public
statement, and (ii) the Company will not be obligated to engage in such
consultation with respect to communications that are (1) principally directed
to employees, customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications
are consistent with previous releases, public disclosures or public statements
made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by the other party),
or (2) relating to a Change in Recommendation or "stop-look-and-listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, in each case, made in accordance with
_Section 5.2_.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Other Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Closing Date,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide to each employee
of the Acquired Companies who continues employment with Parent or the
Surviving Entity following the Effective Time (each, a " **Continuing
Employee** ") with (i) a base salary and annual cash bonus opportunity that
are each no less favorable than the base salary and annual cash bonus
opportunity, in each case, as provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other compensation and benefits
(including severance benefits, paid-time off and health insurance, but
excluding equity-based compensation and long-term incentive compensation) that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other compensation and
benefits provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to ensure that, as of the
Effective Time, each Continuing Employee receives full credit (for all
purposes, including eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual,
vacation entitlement and severance benefits) for service with the Acquired
Companies (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such
past service credit) under the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and
policies of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, in which such
employees became participants; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Entity to, credit to Continuing Employees the amount of
vacation time that such employees had accrued under any applicable Company
Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time. With respect to each health or welfare
benefit plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Entity for the benefit of
Continuing Employees, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to (i) cause to
be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability
requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations
under such plan, and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be

 



      
 

 



 

given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee
under any similar Company Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the
Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Entity, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall honor, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity and their respective Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance
with its terms, (i) each existing (as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time) employment, change in control, retention, severance and termination
protection plan, policy or agreement of or between the Acquired Companies and
any current or former officer, trustee, director or employee of that company,
in each case as set forth on _Part 5.8(c)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (ii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time under any
equity-based, bonus or compensation deferral plans, programs or agreements of
the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates and (iii) all vested and
accrued benefits under any Company Benefit Plan. Parent acknowledges and
agrees that the Transactions shall constitute a "change in control" for
purposes of each Company Benefit Plan that uses such term or a similar term,
including without limitation those agreements set forth on _Part 5.8(c)(ii)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " **Specified Agreements** "). Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, comply with their respective
obligations set forth in _Part 5.8(c)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. If directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company
Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective
not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In
the event that Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and reasonable approval by
Parent).

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended
nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent or the Surviving Entity from
amending or terminating any of its benefit plans in accordance their terms,
(iii) create a right in any employee to employment with Parent or the
Surviving Entity, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
employee of any Acquired Company with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any
Continuing Employee by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Entity or under
any benefit plan which Parent, the Company or the Surviving Entity may
maintain.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain officers and
directors liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time covering each such Person currently covered by the
Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy (accurate and
complete copies of which have been made available to Parent) on terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its
obligation under this _Section 5.9(a)_, neither Parent nor

 



      
 

 



 

the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to pay an aggregate amount for such
insurance policy in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in
its last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof (the " **Current Premium**
") and if such aggregate amount for such insurance policy would at any time
exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Entity shall cause to
be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving Entitys good faith
judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an aggregate amount for
such insurance policy equal to 300% of the Current Premium. Except as set
forth on _Part 5.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, prior to the
Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining insurance policies pursuant to this
_Section 5.9(a)_, Parent shall have the option to cause coverage to be
extended under the Companys officers and directors liability insurance
policy by obtaining a "tail" policy or policies, on terms and conditions no
less favorable than the Companys existing officers and directors liability
insurance policy, which provide such Persons currently covered by such policy
with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time;
subject to the limitations set forth in the provisos above in this _Section
5.9(a)_ and such "tail" policy or policies shall satisfy the provisions of
this _Section 5.9(a)_. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to
the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity to) maintain such policies in full force and effect for their
full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Entity
shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective
Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a trustee, director
or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each an
"Indemnified Party") for any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable
fees and expenses of legal counsel, which shall be advanced as they are
incurred; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have made an undertaking
to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified
Party was not entitled to indemnification under this _Section 5.9(b)_),
judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or
Legal Proceeding (whether civil or criminal) in which such Indemnified Party
may be involved or with which he or she may be threatened (regardless of
whether as a named party or as a participant other than as a named party,
including as a witness) (an " **Indemnified Party Proceeding** ") (A) by
reason of such Indemnified Partys being or having been such trustee, director
or officer or an employee or agent of any of the Acquired Companies or
otherwise in connection with any action taken or not taken at the request of
any of the Acquired Companies at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
or (B) arising out of such Indemnified Partys service in connection with any
other corporation or organization for which he or she serves or has served as
a trustee, director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at the
request of the Company (including in any capacity with respect to any employee
benefit plan) at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time, in each of (A)
or (B), whether or not the Indemnified Party continues in such position at the
time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or threatened (including any
Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the Transactions
or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification
or advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Entity shall not be (x) liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

 



      
 

 



 

conditioned or delayed) or (y) obligated under this _Section 5.9(b)_ to pay
the fees and expenses of more than one legal counsel (selected by a plurality
of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single Legal Proceeding except to the extent
that, on the advice of any such Indemnified Partys counsel, two or more of
such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of
such Legal Proceeding; and (ii) fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company pursuant to: (1) each indemnification agreement set
forth on _Part 5.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and in effect as of
the date hereof between the Company and any Indemnified Party; and (2) any
indemnification provision (including advancement of expenses) and any
exculpation provision set forth in the Organizational Documents of the
Acquired Companies as in effect on the date hereof. Parent shall pay all
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by
Indemnified Parties in connection with their enforcement of their rights
provided under this _Section 5.9_. Parents and the Surviving Entitys
obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses in respect of any claim asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.

 



 

(c) If the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Entity, then, and
in each such case Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under any Organizational Documents, by Contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity under this
_Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any Indemnified Party
unless (A) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(B) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_). Nothing in
this Agreement, including this _Section 5.9_, is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to trustees and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company, any Company Subsidiaries or the Indemnified
Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for
in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such
claims under any such policies.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may reasonably be
necessary to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of Company
Common Shares or Partnership Common Units (including any shares subject to
Company Compensatory Awards) by each Person who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.11 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable notify Parent in writing of, and shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense, negotiations and settlement of, any
Transaction Litigation brought or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
in writing, shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status
thereof and shall give consideration to Parents advice with respect to such
Transaction Litigation. The Company shall give Parent and its Representatives
a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider in good faith all
reasonable comments, on all material filings or responses to be given to any
Third Party or Governmental Entity in connection therewith. None of the
Acquired Companies shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding
or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any
Transaction Litigation unless Parent shall have consented in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). Without
otherwise limiting the Indemnified Parties rights with regard to the right to
counsel, following the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to continue to retain Goodwin Procter LLP or such other counsel
selected by such Indemnified Parties prior to the Effective Time to defend any
Transaction Litigation.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Financing and Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, upon the request of the Company, Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably informed in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (as defined below). The Parent Parties
acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Debt Financing is not a
condition to Closing and the consummation of the Transactions shall not be
conditioned on, or delayed or postponed as a result of the obtaining of (or
the failure to obtain) the Debt Financing.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide, to Parent and Merger Sub, in

customary in connection with the arrangement of debt financing with respect to
the Company, the Acquired Companies or the Company Real Property
(collectively, the " **Debt Financing** "), reasonably requested in writing by

(the " **Lenders** ") reasonably promptly upon written request with such
financial, statistical and other pertinent information and projections
relating to the Acquired Companies as may be reasonably requested by Parent
and reasonably available and prepared by or for the Acquired Companies (or
made available to the Acquired Companies pursuant to the Management Agreement
Documents) in the ordinary course of business; (iv) assist with the
preparation of customary definitive loan documentation contemplated by the
Debt Financing (including schedules), including executing and delivering any

and any obligations contained in such documents shall be effective no earlier
than as of the Effective Time); (v) provide to Parent upon written request all
documentation and other information with respect to the Company and the
Acquired Companies required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know

requested by Parent to facilitate the Debt Financing, following the obtainment
of the Company Shareholder Approval, form new direct and indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries of the Company and the other Acquired Companies pursuant to
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, (vii) as may
be reasonably requested by Parent, and no earlier than immediately prior to
the Effective Time on the Closing Date and provided such actions would not
adversely affect the Tax status of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
cause the Company to be subject to additional Taxes that are not indemnified
by Parent under _Section 5.12(d)_, transfer or otherwise restructure its
ownership of existing Acquired Companies, properties or other assets, in each
case, pursuant to documentation reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company, (viii) subject to the confidentiality requirements of _Section
5.12(e)_, provide reasonably timely and customary access to diligence
materials reasonably available to the Acquired Companies and properties during

obtain any consents associated therewith (effective no earlier than the
Effective Time), (x) to the extent reasonably requested by a Lender, attempt
to obtain estoppels and certificates from tenants, lenders, managers,
franchisors, ground lessors and counterparties to REAs in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to such Lender, (xi) cooperate in connection with the
repayment or defeasance of any existing indebtedness of the Company or any
Acquired Companies as of the Effective Time and the release of related Liens
following the repayment in full of such indebtedness, including using
commercially reasonably efforts to deliver such customary payoff, defeasance
or similar notices under any existing loans of the Company or any of Acquired
Companies as are reasonably requested by Parent (provided that the Company and
the Acquired Companies shall not be required to deliver any notices that are
not conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time), (xii) to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent, obtain customary accountants comfort letters
and consents to the use of accountants audit reports relating to the Company

Representatives to conduct survey, appraisal and environmental and engineering
inspections of each real estate property owned and, subject to obtaining
required third party consents with respect thereto (which the Company shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain), leased by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (provided, however, that (A) neither Parent, any Lender, their
respective Representatives, nor any other Person shall have the right to take
and analyze any samples of any environmental media (including soil,
groundwater, surface water, air or sediment) or any building material or to
perform any invasive testing procedure on any such property, (B) Parent shall
schedule and coordinate all inspections with the Company in accordance with
_Section 5.5_, and (C) the Company shall be entitled to have representatives
present at all times during any such inspection); it being understood that,
other than with respect to any obligation to deliver notice to or make a
request of any Person, the Company shall have satisfied its obligations set
forth in clauses (i)-(xiv) of

 



      
 

 



 

this sentence if the Company shall have used its commercially reasonable
efforts to comply with such obligations whether or not any applicable
deliverables are actually obtained or provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not be required to provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to
provide, cooperation under this _Section 5.12_ to the extent that it: (A)
unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of the Acquired Companies;
(B) requires the Acquired Companies to incur any Liability (including, without
limitation, any commitment fees and expense reimbursement) in connection with
the Debt Financing prior to the Closing (except those fees and expenses that
are reimbursed promptly or advanced by Parent); (C) except with respect to
clauses (v), (vi) and (vii), requires the Acquired Companies or their
respective directors, trustees, officers, managers or employees to execute,
deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement, document, certificate or
instrument with respect to the Debt Financing (other than with respect to
customary authorization letters with respect to bank information memoranda) or
adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant
to which the Debt Financing is obtained that is not contingent upon the
Closing or that would be effective at or prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time; (D) requires the Acquired Companies or their counsel to give any legal
opinion; (E) requires the Acquired Companies to provide any information that
is prohibited or restricted by applicable Law; (F) provide access to or
disclose information that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries determines
would result in a loss or waiver of or jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product or other legal privilege (provided that the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in the events set out in this
clause (F)); (G) requires the Acquired Companies to take any action that is
prohibited or restricted by, or will conflict with or violate, its
organizational documents, or would result in a violation or breach of, or
default under, any Material Contract to which the Acquired Companies is a
party; (H) results in any officer, trustee or director of the Acquired
Companies incurring personal Liability with respect to any matter relating to
the Debt Financing or requires any officer, trustee, director or other
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any
certificate that such officer, trustee, director or other Representative
reasonably believes, in good faith, contains any untrue certifications; or (I)
requires the Acquired Companies or their Representatives, as applicable, to
waive or amend any terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be
in breach of this Agreement because of the failure to deliver any financial or
other information that is not currently readily available to the Acquired
Companies (other than information which an Acquired Company is entitled to
receive and actually receives following request pursuant to Management
Agreement Documents or Franchise Agreement Documents) on the date hereof or is
not otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of business of Acquired
Companies at the time requested by Parent or for the failure to obtain review
of any financial or other information by its accountants. In no event shall
the Acquired Companies be required to pay any commitment or other fee or give
an indemnity or incur any Liability (including due to any act or omission by
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives) or expense (including legal and accounting expenses) in
connection with assisting Parent and Merger Sub in arranging the Debt
Financing or as a result of any information provided by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with the Debt Financing (except those fees and expenses reimbursed
promptly by Parent). None of the representations, warranties or covenants of
the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed
breached or violated by, any of the actions

 



      
 

 



 

taken by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives at the request of Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
provisions contained in this _Section 5.12(b)_ represent the sole obligation
of the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates with respect to
cooperation in connection with the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, the condition precedent set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_, as it
applies to the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.12_, shall be
deemed satisfied, unless the Company has materially and willfully breached its
obligations under this _Section 5.12_, Parent has provided to the Company
written notice of such breach within ten (10) Business Days of first becoming
aware of such breach and the Company fails to cure such breach by the earlier
of ten (10) Business Days after such notice is provided or five (5) Business
Days prior to the End Date.

 



 

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Acquired Companies or the reputation or goodwill of the Acquired
Companies.

 



 

(d) Parent shall reimburse the Acquired Companies promptly upon demand for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
and accountants fees) incurred by the Acquired Companies in connection with
the cooperation under this _Section 5.12_, any action taken by them at the
request of Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ (including the dissolution
and termination of any subsidiaries formed and documentation entered into
pursuant to this _Section 5.12_) and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Acquired Companies from and against any and all out-of-pocket costs, expenses,
losses, damages, claims, judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements,
awards and Liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
the arrangement and consummation of the Debt Financing and any information
used in connection therewith (other than the information provided in writing
by the Company or the Acquired Companies to Parent specifically in connection
with their obligations pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)_). This _Section
5.12(d)_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement (and in the event the
Mergers and the other Transactions are not consummated, Parent shall promptly
reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation under this
_Section 5.12_ and not previously reimbursed).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company agrees that Parent and its Representatives may initiate contact
with and pursue potential Lenders in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case subject to the
confidentiality and use restrictions applicable to "Representatives" (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, without the prior written consent of
the Company, in no event will Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates (which for this purpose will be deemed to include each direct
investor in Parent or Merger Sub) enter into any agreement, arrangement or any
other understanding, whether written or oral, with any potential debt
financing source or sources that would reasonably be expected to limit,
restrict, restrain, otherwise impair in any manner, directly or indirectly,
the ability of such debt financing source or sources (including any Lender) to
provide debt financing or other assistance to any other party in any other
transaction involving the Acquired Company

 



      
 

 



 

(provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit the establishment of customary
"tree" arrangements).

 



 

Section 5.13 _Confidentiality_. All information provided by or on behalf of
the Acquired Companies pursuant to this Agreement (including in connection
with the Debt Financing) will be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect,
notwithstanding clause (a) of Section 22 thereof; _provided_ that Parent and
its Representatives may disclose Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) subject to the confidentiality restrictions
applicable to "Representatives" (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement to (i) potential purchasers (and
their financing sources) of one or more Company Real Properties or
Subsidiaries of the Company that directly or indirectly own Company Real
Properties and (ii) Parents potential Lenders as permitted by _Section
5.12(e)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to the preceding clause
(i), (A) such potential purchasers (and their financing sources) shall not use
any such Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
other than in connection with their consideration, evaluation, negotiation,
financing and if applicable, consummation of such a transaction and (B) Parent
shall require that any such potential purchasers (and their affiliates) not
enter into any agreement, arrangement or any other understanding, whether
written or oral, with any potential debt financing source or sources that
would reasonably be expected to limit, restrict, restrain, otherwise impair in
any manner, directly or indirectly, the ability of such debt financing source
or sources to provide debt financing or other assistance to any other party in
any other transaction involving the Company (provided that the foregoing shall
not prohibit the establishment of customary "tree" arrangements). Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis with
respect to potential transactions involving Company Real Properties, including
the identities of potential purchasers to whom Parent has furnished Evaluation
Material.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Other Transactions; Parent-Approved Transactions_. The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation and
assistance as Parent may reasonably request to (a) convert or cause the
conversion of one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Company that are
organized as corporations into limited liability companies and one or more of
its Subsidiaries that are organized as limited partnerships into limited
liability companies, on the basis of organizational documents as reasonably
requested by Parent, (b) sell or cause to be sold stock, partnership
interests, limited liability company interests or other equity interests
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company in one or more of its wholly-
owned Subsidiaries at a price and on such other terms as designated by Parent,
(c) exercise any right of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to terminate
or cause to be terminated any Contract to which the Company or one of its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries is a party and (d) sell or cause to be sold any of
the assets of the Company or one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries at a
price and on such other terms as designated by Parent (any action or
transaction described in clause (a) through (d), a " **Parent-Approved
Transaction** "); _provided_ , that (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action in contravention of (A) any
organizational document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) any
Material Contract, or (C) applicable Law, (ii) any such conversions, exercises
of any rights of termination or other terminations, sales or transactions,
including the consummation of any Parent-Approved Transaction or other
obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries to incur any liabilities with
respect thereto, shall be contingent upon all of the conditions set forth in
_Article 6_ having been

 



      
 

 



 

satisfied (or, with respect to _Section 6.2_, waived) and receipt by the
Company of a written notice from Parent to such effect and that the Parent
Parties are prepared to proceed immediately with the Closing and any other
evidence reasonably requested by the Company that the Closing will occur (it
being understood that in any event the transactions described in clauses (a),
(b), (c) and (d) will be deemed to have occurred prior to the Closing), (iii)
such actions (or the inability to complete such actions) shall not affect or
modify in any respect the obligations of the Parent Parties under this
Agreement, including the amount of or timing of payment of the Merger
Consideration, (iv) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any such action that could adversely affect the
classification of the Company, or any Company Subsidiary that is classified as
a REIT, as a REIT or could subject the Company or any such Subsidiary to any
"prohibited transactions" Taxes or other material Taxes under Code Sections
857(b), 860(c) or 4981 (or other material entity-level Taxes) and (v) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any such
action that could result in any United States federal, state or local income
Tax being imposed on any holder of Partnership Common Units other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such actions or transactions shall be
undertaken in the manner (including in the order) specified by Parent and,
subject to the limits set forth above and except as agreed by Parent and the
Company, such actions or transactions shall be implemented immediately prior
to or concurrent with the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to apply to, or be deemed to be breached or
violated by, the transactions or cooperation contemplated by this _Section
5.14_. The Company shall not be deemed to have made an Change in
Recommendation or entered into or agreed to enter an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement as a result of providing any cooperation or taking any actions to
the extent requested by Parent in connection with a Parent-Approved
Transaction. The consummation of any Parent-Approved Transaction shall not
constitute consummation of an Acquisition Proposal for purposes of _Section
7.3(b)(iii)_, nor shall any Acquisition Proposal made in respect of a Parent-
Approved Transaction constitute an Acquisition Proposal for purposes of
_Section 7.3(b)(iii)_. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in performing their obligations under this
_Section 5.14_, and Parent shall indemnify the Company and its Subsidiaries
for any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries arising therefrom (and in the event the Mergers and
the other Transactions are not consummated, Parent shall promptly reimburse
the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries not previously reimbursed).

 



 

Section 5.15 _Distribution by Company of REIT Taxable Income_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the Closing Date, any of
the Company and its Subsidiary REITs may declare and pay a dividend to their
shareholders distributing cash in such amounts determined by the Company in
its sole discretion exercised in good faith to be required to be distributed
in order for the Company or the Subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT for such
year and to avoid to the extent reasonably possible the incurrence of income
or excise Tax by the Company or the Subsidiary REIT. If the Company declares a
distribution to its shareholders pursuant to this _Section 5.15_, the Merger
Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to such distribution.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.16 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take such actions as the Company determines are
reasonably necessary to ensure that the Company and any Subsidiary REIT (i)
will qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for
its current taxable year and, if the Closing Date occurs in 2019, its 2019
taxable year, and (ii) will not become liable for U.S. federal income Tax
under Section 857(b) or 4981 of the Code. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent if the Company becomes aware of any issue
that it believes would adversely impact the maintenance of the REIT status of
the Company and its Subsidiary REITs for the Companys 2018 taxable year and,
if the Closing Date occurs in 2019, the Companys 2019 taxable year, and
cooperate and consult in good faith with Parent with respect thereto.

 



 

(b) All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use, registration, value-added
and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes)
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (" **Transfer
Taxes** ") will be borne by Parent. Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
file or cause to be filed in a timely manner all necessary documents
(including, but not limited to, all Tax Returns) with respect to such Transfer
Taxes.

 



 

(c) On the Closing Date, prior to the Company Merger, the Company shall
deliver to Merger Sub a duly executed certificate of non-foreign status, dated
as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form of the sample certification
set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B). The Operating
Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
deliver to Merger Sub at or prior to the Partnership Merger a duly executed
certificate of non-foreign status, dated as of the Closing Date, from each
holder of Partnership Common Units (other than the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company), substantially in the form of the sample certification set
forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B), as
applicable, in compliance with Code Sections 1445 and 1446(f); provided,
however, that in the event that any such certificate of non-foreign status is
not delivered to Merger Sub at or prior to the Partnership Merger, Parents
remedy shall be limited to withholding pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Parent and the Company shall, upon written request, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement).

 



 

Section 5.17 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Law and rules and policies of the NYSE to cause the delisting of
the Company and of the Company Common Shares and Company Preferred Shares from
the NYSE as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the Company Common Shares and Company Preferred Shares under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company Parties shall not take any
action that would cause the Transactions, including the Mergers, to be subject
to requirements imposed by

 



      
 

 



 

any Takeover Statute. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to
be, applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers or any other Transactions, each
of the Company and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Parent Parties and
the Transactions.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 6 
CONDITIONS TO THE MERGERS**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party_. The obligation of
each party to consummate the Mergers are subject to the satisfaction or, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver by each of Parent and the
Company of, on or prior to the Closing, of the following conditions:

7.1(d)_ or _Section 7.1(e)_ and (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
received by the Company or its Representatives or any Person shall have
publicly proposed or publicly announced an intention (whether or not

for such termination; _provided_ that if the Company fails to pay the Company
Termination Fee and any Parent Party commences a suit against the Company for
the Company Termination Fee or any portion thereof and prevails in such suit,
then the Company shall pay the Parent Parties their costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the Company Termination Fee at the "prime
rate" as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment

days elapsed, without compounding).

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(f_) or _Section 7.1(i)_, then Parent shall pay the Company the Parent
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on the third Business Day
following such termination in accordance with _Section 7.4_. For the
avoidance of doubt, any payment made by Parent under this _Section 7.3(c)_

may be payable under one or more provisions hereof. In the event that the
Company shall receive full payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
this _Section 7.3(c)_, the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages (and not a penalty) in a reasonable amount to
compensate the Company Parties for any and all losses or damages suffered or

Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of the Company
Parties, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding against the Parent Parties
or their Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming
the basis for such termination; _provided_ that if Parent fails to pay the
Parent Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses and the Company commences a
suit against Parent for the Parent Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses,

reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the Parent Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses at
the

payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual
number of days elapsed, without compounding) (the " **Recovery Costs** ").

 



 

Section 7.4 _Payment of Amount or Expense_.

 



 

(a) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Company the Parent
Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs set forth in
_Section 7.3_, Parent shall pay to the Company from the Parent Termination
Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs deposited into escrow in
accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the
Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs and
(ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Company without
causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code for the relevant tax year determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A) through
(H) or 856(c)(3)(A) through (I) of the Code (" **Qualifying Income** "), as
determined by the Companys independent certified public accountants, plus (2)
in the event the Company receives either (X) a letter from the Companys
counsel indicating that the Company has received a ruling from the IRS

outside counsel as described in _Section 7.4(b)(ii)_, an amount equal to the
Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs less

pay these amounts, Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to
the Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs
with an escrow agent selected by Parent and on such terms (subject to _Section
7.4(b)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the
escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Parent Termination
Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs pursuant to this _Section
7.4(a)_ shall be made at the time Parent is obligated to pay the Company such
amount pursuant to _Section 7.3_ by wire transfer.

 



 

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Parent Termination Fee, plus
the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs in escrow or any portion thereof
shall not be released to the Company unless the escrow agent receives any one
or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Companys independent
certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by
the escrow agent to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant
tax year determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Companys accountants
revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount
to the Company, (ii) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the
Companys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
release of the remainder of the Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent
Expenses and the Recovery Costs (or portion thereof) from the escrow should
not cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT, in which case the escrow
agent shall release the remainder of the Parent Termination Fee, plus the
Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs (or portion thereof) to the Company, or
(iii) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company received
a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Company of the Parent
Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs should either

 



      
 

 



 

constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively,
indicating that the Companys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to
the effect that the receipt by the Company of the Parent Termination Fee, plus
the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs should either constitute Qualifying
Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent shall release
the remainder of the Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the
Recovery Costs to the Company. Parent agrees to amend this _Section 7.4_ at
the request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Parent
Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs that may be
distributed to the Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve
the Companys chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this
_Section 7.4(b)_ or (z) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal
opinion from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 7.4(b)_. The
escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Parent Termination
Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs that remains unpaid as of
the end of a tax year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following
tax year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this _Section 7.4_;
_provided_ , any portion of the Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent
Expenses and the Recovery Costs that remains unpaid as of December 31
following the date which is five years from the date of this Agreement shall
be released by the escrow agent to Parent. Parent shall not be a party to such
escrow agreement and shall not bear any cost of or have Liability resulting
from the escrow agreement. The Company shall fully indemnify Parent and hold
Parent harmless from and against any such cost or Liability.

of any party to pursue appeals from any judgments or Order of a Chosen Court
as provided by Law. Each of the parties agrees, that service of process may be
made on such party by prepaid certified mail in the manner provided in
_Section 8.7_ with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States

such party personally within the State of Maryland. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH

FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS

Section 8.6 _Assignability; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure to the benefit of, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This
Agreement shall not be assignable by any party without the express written
consent of the other parties hereto, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_
, that, prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys
shareholders, Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, one or
more wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries to be a party to the Mergers
in lieu of Merger Sub and/or Merger OP, in which event all references herein
to Merger Sub and/or Merger OP shall be deemed references to such other
Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub and/or Merger OP as of the date of this Agreement shall
be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; provided, further, that any
such designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions. After the Effective Time, the Parent Parties may assign their
rights under this Agreement to any parties providing secured debt financing
for purposes of creating a security interest herein. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer on any Person other than
the parties hereto or their respective permitted assigns any rights, remedies,
obligations or Liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as
provided in _Section 5.9_, which provision shall inure to the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties who shall be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may
enforce the covenants contained therein. The parties hereto further agree that
the rights of third party beneficiaries under _Section 5.9_ shall not arise
unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties
in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties may be subject to waiver by the parties hereto
in accordance with _Section 8.2_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to

 



      
 

 



 

expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such
court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the
parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid
or unenforceable term.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by
facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind
the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Obligation of Parent_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub and Merger
OP to comply in all respects with each of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be
performed by Merger Sub and Merger OP in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Mergers, and the other Transactions. As a material inducement
to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full
performance and payment by Merger Sub and Merger OP of each of their
respective covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed by
Merger Sub and Merger OP under this Agreement and the Transactions, subject to
all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby
represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such breach of any such
representation and warranty or default in the performance of any such
covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Merger Sub and Merger OP
shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the Company
shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and
all available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or
nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent and Merger Sub in the
first instance. As applicable, references in this _Section 8.10_ to "Merger
Sub" shall also include the Surviving Entity following the Effective Time and
references in this _Section 8.10_ to "Merger OP" shall also include the
Surviving Partnership following the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Specific Performance; Parent Liability Cap._

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Company
Parties in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages (even if available) or other legal remedies would not
be an adequate remedy for any such harm. The parties hereto agree that unless
and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_ and
any dispute over the right to termination has been finally resolved, (i) the
Parent Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a court
of competent jurisdiction as set forth in _Section 8.5_ to prevent breaches
of this Agreement by the Company Parties, to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement or provide other equitable relief, without
bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any remedy to
which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ or
otherwise, and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the Transactions, including the Mergers,

 



      
 

 



 

and without that right, none of the Parent Parties would have entered into
this Agreement. Each of the Company Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on
the basis that any of the Parent Parties has an adequate remedy at Law or that
any such injunction or award of specific performance or other equitable relief
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason. The parties hereto agree that no
Company Party shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement by
any of the Parent Parties or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof and that each Company Partys sole and exclusive remedy relating to a
breach of this Agreement by any Parent Party or otherwise shall be the remedy
set forth in _Section 7.3(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach by Parent
of _Section 5.13_ or the second sentence of _Section 7.4(b)_.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this _Section 8.11_, a Parent Party shall not in any respect waive its
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such party
under this Agreement (including monetary damages) for breach of any of the
provisions of this Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section
8.11_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set
forth in this _Section 8.11_ shall require any Parent Party to institute any
Legal Proceeding for (or limit any Parent Partys right to institute any Legal
Proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 8.11_ prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under _Article 7_ (and pursuing
damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal
Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 8.11_ or anything set forth in this
_Section 8.11_ restrict or limit any Parent Partys right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 7_ or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate Liability of the Parent Parties for losses, damages, costs or
expenses relating to the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, breach
of this Agreement by any Parent Party or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guarantee and the Transactions
shall be limited to an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee, plus the
Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs (collectively, the " **Parent Liability
Cap** "), and in no event shall the Company Parties or any of their Affiliates
seek any amount in excess of the Parent Liability Cap in connection with this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guarantee or the Transactions or
in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise. Each
of the Company Parties agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no
personal liability shall attach to, any of the Parent-Related Parties (other
than Parent, Merger Sub or Merger OP to the extent provided in this Agreement
and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P. to the extent provided in the
Confidentiality Agreement), through Parent, Merger Sub or Merger OP or
otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or Merger OP against any Parent-Related Party, by
the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except
for its rights to recover from the Sponsor (but not any

 



       
 

 



 

other Parent-Related Party) under and to the extent provided in the Guarantee
and subject to the Parent Liability Cap and the other limitations described
therein. Recourse against the Sponsor under the Guarantee shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company, the Operating Partnership and their
respective Affiliates against the Sponsor and any other Parent-Related Party
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or Merger OP to the extent provided in this
Agreement and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P. to the extent provided in
the Confidentiality Agreement) in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory
of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. Without limiting the rights of the Company
against Parent, Merger Sub or Merger OP hereunder and Blackstone Real Estate
Advisors L.P. under the Confidentiality Agreement, in no event shall the
Company or its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any
claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover damages from,
any Parent-Related Party (other than the Sponsor to the extent provided in the
Guarantee and subject to the Parent Liability Cap and the other limitations
described therein).
